Herein, based on the new emerging two-dimensional (2D) material of MoSi2N4, we report novel Janus MoSiGeN4 and WSiGeN4 structures with excellent stabilities and great potentials in photocatalytic applications through first-principles calculations. Comprehensive studies show that MoSi2N4, MoSiGeN4, and WSiGeN4 exhibit semiconductor characteristics with an indirect gap, appropriate band gaps, and strong optical absorbance in the visible spectrum. Excitingly, by constructing Janus structures, an intrinsic electric field is realized that enhances the spatial separation and anisotropic migration of photoexcited electrons and holes. Further, this strategy can also alter the band alignment to provide an adequate photoexcited carrier driving force for water redox reactions. Moreover, the surface N vacancy can effectively lower the energy demand of both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) so that the catalytic process can be self-sustained under the potential provided by the photocatalyst alone. Particularly, the overall water splitting can proceed simultaneously and spontaneously on the surface of MoSiGeN4 and WSiGeN4 when pH is 3 or >= 8, respectively. These explorations offer new prospects for the design of highly efficient photocatalysts.									25	2	0	0	0	0	26			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000667982100033	34115478

The formation of acetone and acetylene is indicative of the basic properties of the zinc oxide surface. This basic catalyst, whose conversion level depends on the nature of the pre-treatment, was found to deactivate versus time on stream. Poisoning the basic sites by CO2 pre-adsorption only affects the active sites working at the beginning of the reaction, those still working at steady state being not impacted. This is consistent with the modification of the strength and population of the active sites during the catalytic reaction. Indeed, from operando DRIFTS experiments, at the beginning of the reaction, the strong acid base pairs generated upon inert treatment at 773 K promote the self aldol condensation of acetone, leading to oligomers. This reaction also produces water, which dissociates on the surface, filling up oxygen vacancies. This contributes to the lowering of the strength of the active sites, resulting in the quenching of polymerization of acetone at a certain stage, at the benefit of the increase of the amount of diacetone alcohol. Consistently, pre-adsorption of water was shown to lead to a decrease of the conversion level, resulting in a conversion profile similar to that obtained after 10 min of reaction in the absence of pre-adsorbed water. The poisoning mechanism proposed is based on the evolution of the IR bands versus time and is in line with the evolution of the deactivation profile versus time. It is concluded that both the control of the conversion level and the dependence of the reaction toward deactivation are associated to the formation of oxygen vacancies during the pre-treatment step but also on their stability in the conditions on the implemented catalytic reaction.

In the physical model, the TaO2-x layer acts as an oxygen reservoir to store and release oxygen ions (O2-) during switching cycles and different oxygen contents in TaO2-x layer correspond to different capabilities to take redox reactions with O2-. The proposed model is implemented into an atomic Monte-Carlo simulator involving the evolution of oxygen distribution in Ta2O5-x/TaO2-x stack to reproduce the impacts of different TaO2-x layers on endurance performance. Results reveal that the optimized TaO2-x layer with the feature of easily storing O2- as lattice oxygen (LO) during SET and decomposing to release O2- during RESET is beneficial to enhance the endurance property.

Consequently, 2D high entropy FeNiCoMnVOx oxide arrays are fabricated, and further treated by Ar plasma to generate oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalyst, which possess a well-defined crystal structure that are analogous to the structures of Mn3O4 and the morphology like a number of vertically aligned nanosheets. Remarkably, the catalyst exhibits superior electrocatalytic HER activity with a small overpotential of 81 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 88 mV dec(-1). It can stably operate at 10 mA cm(-2) up to 100 h with negligible activity decay. Further combination of experimental results and DFT computations illustrate the synergistic effect of five metal active sites that can dwindle the Gibbs energy barrier of the H* desorption step during the process of HER. In addition, oxygen vacancies which generated by Ar plasma can modulate the surface of catalyst to enrich the electron density of metal sites and contribute superior HER performance.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000763360900005

Herein, based on the perspective of the dynamically stable interface, we purposely design the well-dispersed nanorod arrays of CoMoO4 as a host on activated iron foam (IF) to realize the optimal redeposition of FeOOH, constructing a self-sacrificial template rich in the FeOOH surface. Notably, at long-time oxidation potential, the precatalyst FeOOH-CoMoO4 can realize MoO42- dissolution and redeposition of Co oxyhydroxides on FeOOH host simultaneously, constructing a dynamically stable Fe(Co)OOH interface. The introduction of CoOOH improves conductivity and provides synergistic effect with FeOOH to lower the energy barrier for OER and maintain long-time stability, eventually exhibiting a low overpotential of 298 mV to reach the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and high stability over 60 h. This work demonstrates the feasibility of manipulating metal dissolution-redeposition process for a dynamically stable interface.									8	2	0	0	1	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000643578300028	33822578

However, unsatisfactory Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and poor Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability are obstacles to its practical application. Herein, we designed a strategy to improve the electrocatalytic performance of Mo2C by constructing a Co and Mo2C heterostructure supported on carbon (Co/Mo2C@C). Experimental and theoretical calculations showed the significant improvements caused by the synergistic effects between Co and Mo2C. Electrons from Co could transfer to Mo2C and accumulate on Mo. This promoted the adsorption of H2O and desorption of H, which improved the HER. In contrast, the Co could inhibit the oxidation and dissolution of Mo2C through a "self-sacrifice" effect, which significantly improved the OER stability of Mo2C. Owing to the synergetic effects between Co and Mo2C, the as-synthesized catalyst exhibited superior electrocatalytic performances in an alkaline electrolyte, and afforded low overpotentials of 98 and 254 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for catalyzing the HER and OER, respectively. Moreover, Co/Mo2C@C enabled overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.59 V, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an exceptional electrochemical stability that outperformed noble-metal catalysts.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000722580800007

Herein, NiRu nanoparticles encapsulated into N-doped carbon (NiRu@NC) are fabricated with the assistance of MOF for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and also evolved into core-shell structured nanomaterials with abundant interfaces for oxygen evolution reaction (OER, Ni/RuOx@C). Benefiting from optimized electronic structure, interfacial synergy effect and special core-shell structure (similar to 150 nm), the newly developed electrocatalysts present remarkable electrocatalytic activities with small over-potentials to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER (19 mV in alkaline, 80 mV in neutral, 20 mV in acid) and OER (252 mV, 316 mV, 211 mV). Moreover, the obtained electrocatalysts exhibit outstanding catalytic performances for overall water-splitting in a two-electrode system with 1.53 V and 1.67 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in basic and neutral electrolyte, respectively. Remarkably, a small potential of 1.47 V is required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic media and no significant decay of the activity is observed. This work paves the way for designing a novel class of electrocatalyst that can not only exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic water splitting performances in various conditions, but also possess excellent stabilities for future generation of clean energy.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000711877200003

However, it still remains a challenge to directly use MOF-based materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Herein, a hierarchical Co,Fe-MOF-74/Co/carbon cloth (CC) three-layer hybrid electrode is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition technology with subsequent solvothermal treatment. Electrochemical performance investigations show that the asconstructed Co,Fe-MOF-74/Co/CC electrode exhibits impressive electrocatalytic activity for full water splitting, which only requires a low overpotential of 226 mV@20 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 94 mV@-10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Employing the as-constructed electrode as the anode and cathode in a two-electrode setup simultaneously, only 1.65 V of the voltage is needed to deliver the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The above excellent electrochemical performances should be attributed to the specific architecture, the synergistic effect of the Co and Fe species, and the superhydrophilic surface of the catalyst. More importantly, further investigations uncover that metal hydroxides and oxyhydroxides produced in situ during electrochemical tests are the veritable active species, which promote the high catalytic activity of the present catalyst.									44	1	0	0	2	0	44			2168-0485			WOS:000562983600017

It was found that the presence of a CuFe2O4 OC increases the gasification reaction rate of coal in comparison to the use of inert bed material (silica sand). The CuFe2O4 OC enhanced the performance of hematite and improved the ability to produce syngas of CuO OCs. During the chemical looping process, CuFe2O4 was reduced to Fe3O4 and Cu. Furthermore, N-2 adsorption/desorption and scanning electron microscopy images verified that the released O-2 and the generated CO2 by the CuFe2O4 OCs improved the carbon conversion and facilitated the pore opening and expansion shown by the increase in specific surface area. This can be used as a theoretical reference that can be used to gain a better understanding of the microscopic mechanism for how CuFe2O4 OCs can accelerate the chemical looping gasification of coal.									6	2	0	0	0	0	7			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000512440800001

However, promoting the catalyst activity and stability in sulfide solution remains a great challenge. In this work, a sulfur-tolerable bifunctional Cu2S micro-flake catalyst supported on nickel foam (Cu2S/NF) was fabricated for catalyzing the SOR-assisted electrochemical water splitting. The Cu2S/NF electrode exhibited good activity and stability for both the SOR (0.26 V vs. RHE) and HER (-0.18 V vs. RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). The anodic product obeyed the chain-growing mechanism of HS- -> S-n(2-) (polysulfides) in alkaline solutions. Moreover, for a two-electrode SOR-assisted water splitting system, a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) was successfully obtained at a cell voltage of only 0.64 V. Compared to the normal water splitting (OER + HER), our system (SOR + HER) can save 74% energy consumption when producing the same amount of H-2, close to the theoretic energy-saving value of 86%. This work proposed a new way for not only generating highly efficient hydrogen but also reusing the toxic sulfide waste, which shed light on the low-cost and scaling-up hydrogen production using waste resources.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000683491100001

Numerical modeling of an abiotic hyporheic mixing-dependent reaction: Chemical evolution of mixing and reactant production zones								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				251						104066	10.1016/j.jconhyd.2022.104066				DEC 2022	2022	Mixing-dependent reactions occur where groundwater and surface water mix in shallow sediments (hyporheic zone) and can attenuate contaminants along upwelling flowpaths, thus reducing transport to surface water. Here we used MODFLOW/SEAM3D to numerically simulate prior laboratory observations of a mixing-dependent reaction between sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) and dissolved oxygen (DO) to produce sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). This reaction is not common in nature but is used as a surrogate for mixing-dependent DO consuming reactions of environmental significance. We evaluated how location and thickness of mixing zones and reaction product production zones dynamically respond to variations in hydraulic and chemical boundary conditions and reaction kinetic rate. Sensitivity analysis showed that location and thickness of mixing zones and reactant production zones were most sensitive to changes in the balance of hydrologic inflow from groundwater and surface water (inflow ratio). Mixing zone thickness for reactive DO calibrated to experimental data was thinner than that for the "DO tracer " (identical source location and concentration as DO but conservative tracer), indicating that as DO is consumed its mixing zone narrows. The SO4 production zone was consistently thicker than the DO mixing zone. Small changes in mixing/production zone thicknesses were linked to large changes in mass consumed and produced, indicating the potential for simpler field metrics like thickness to act as surrogates for more chal-lenging measurements such as contaminant flux or consumption in monitoring natural attenuation. This study improves understanding of the evolution of hyporheic mixing-dependent reaction zones that occur even under steady state hydraulics, emphasizing their complex controls.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000855040900003	36054959

Therefore, in this paper, hierarchical structure NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF with Ni12P5 nanorod arrays coupled with NiSe nanospheres are synthesized on bare nickel-copper foam (NCF) by exogenous phosphorylation and subsequent electrodeposition methods. The catalytic performance of hierarchical structure NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF in ureaassisted electrolytic water reaction is studied in focus. The results show that the potential of NiSe@Ni12P5/ NCF was only 1.267 V and 1.412 V vs RHE at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, in addition to no significant activity decay after 140 h stability test. This is attributed to the fact that the introduction of NiSe regulated the interfacial charge distribution, creating an interfacial coupling effect that can greatly increase the original catalytic species, as well as the NiOOH species generated during the UOR process as true active sites, which ultimately improving the electrocatalytic UOR performance of NiSe@Ni12P5/NCF. This study provides a new idea for the preparation of hierarchical selenide - phosphides for electrochemical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000873701900004

Herein, a novel electrocatalyst was fabricated via a facile synthesis strategy for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalyst was designed by dualcoupling iron and Ni2P into P-doped porous carbon (PC) sheets, which were uniformly shelled over onedimensional copper sulfide (CuxS) arrays to form a unique nanobrush architecture. The synergistic effects between the iron and ultrasmall Ni2P nanoparticles offered a dominant contribution to the catalytic activities with a low required overpotential of 112.9 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2 for the HER and 330 mV to reach 50 mA cm-2 for the OER, superior to bare CuxS and Ni2P@PC/CuxS. An electrolyzer cell originated from Fe-Ni2P@PC/CuxS electrodes required a small cell voltage of 1.62 V at a current response of 10 mA cm-2, which even interestingly surpassed recently reported ones. The excellent performance of the proposed Fe-Ni2P@PC/CuxS material made it an innovative bifunctional candidate for overall water splitting applications.									31	3	0	0	1	0	31			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000649701100001

Co-N/PC@CNT-Ts inherit the octahedral shape from the precursor, and have a porous structure with in situ grown CNTs catalyzed by Co particles. Co-N/PC@CNT-T materials have excellent activities as bifunctional electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. Among the Co-N/PC@CNT-Ts, Co-N/PC@CNT-700 has the highest electrocatalytic activity. For ORR, Co-N/PC@CNT-700 has a higher onset potential of 0.92 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), high stability and methanol tolerance, which are even better than that of Pt/C. For OER, it has a low potential of 1.63 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, Co-N/PC@CNT-700 affords a low reversible overvoltage (bifunctional performance parameter) of 0.862 V between ORR and OER compared to the current advancing bifunctional catalysts. The superb bifunctional activity can be attributed to uniform CoNx active sites embedded in graphitized carbon, unique in situ grown CNT structure and ordered mesoporous structure. The synergistic effect enlarged the contact surface, exposed more active centers and provided many pathways, thereby boosting the electrocatalytic performance. In conclusion, this study provides a novel avenue for the application of stable transition metal-based, nitrogen-doped carbon materials as extremely efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and OER.									87	5	0	0	2	0	87			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000437007700017	29718034

There are many ideas on how enzymes cause this. Recent work has focused on the importance of a positive charge near NS of the reduced flavin. Fructosamine oxidase has a lysine near NS of its flavin. We measured a rate constant of 1.6 x 10(5) M(-1) s(-1) for its reaction with oxygen. The Lys276Met mutant reacted with a rate constant of 291 M(-1) s(-1), suggesting an important role for this lysine in oxygen activation. The dihydroorotate dehydrogenases from E. coli and L. lactis also have a lysine near NS of the flavin. They react with O(2) with rate constants of 6.2 x 10(4) and 3.0 x 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. The Lys66Met and Lys43Met mutant enzymes react with rate constants that are nearly the same as those for the wild-type enzymes, demonstrating that simply placing a positive charge near N5 of the flavin does not guarantee increased oxygen reactivity. Our results show that the lysine near NS does not exert an effect without an appropriate context; evolution did not find only one mechanism for activating the reaction of flavins with O(2).									60	0	0	0	47	0	60			0002-7863			WOS:000296678200026	21958058

The material is sequentially electrodeposited on a glassy carbon electrode from aqueous solutions of MoO42 and PtCl42 either by cycling the potential or by applying pulsed potential technique. Chemical and morphological characterization of the electrode surface was made by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The electrode performance towards oxygen reduction reaction was investigated in pH 5.0 acetate buffer solution saturated with oxygen and parameters such as the cell content and electrodeposition conditions were optimized. The performance of the electrode was compared with Pt disk, bare glassy carbon, platinum modified glassy carbon electrodes along with the electrode modified in a single step and named as Pt-MoOx/GCE. Overall results indicated that sequentially deposited molybdenum oxide and platinum modified glassy carbon electrode designated as Pt/MoOx/GCE has shown higher catalytic activity considering the peak location and current intensities. This was consisted with the pulsed electrodeposition process and even higher catalytic activity was obtained than the electrode modified by cycling voltammetry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a pressure-dependent template-free solvothermal method is developed to controllably synthesize four kinds of uniform CeO2 mesoporous nanostructures in a single reaction system, i.e., mesoporous nanospheres, nanoporous mesocrystals, hollow nanospheres, and nanowires. They all comprise small nanoclusters (3-5 nm). Properly adjusting the reaction pressure allows for achieving the transition between them. Furthermore, the corresponding pressure-induced self-assembly (Ostwald ripening, reconstruction) mechanisms are proposed to illustrate the morphological evolution process. In addition, they also display large specific surface area and excellent catalytic activity for CO oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000375520900002

The resultant defect-rich ultrathin Co(OH)(2) (D-U-Co(OH)(2)) nanoarray is one of the most active monometal-based oxygen evolution catalysts to date. Its activity is 3-4 times higher than that of the commercial RuO2 and superior to that of the reported exfoliated bimetallic catalysts. Co-MOF can also be grown on various substrates, and the chemical composition of the defect-rich 2D materials is tunable by changing the metal ions in the etchants. Owing to these merits of the unique synthesis route, our work provides an opportunity for synthesizing advanced nanomaterials that are difficult to get access to by conventional methods.									101	1	0	0	11	0	102			2380-8195			WOS:000456493100046

The slow kinetics of oxygen reactions; however, limits the use of metal-air batteries and fuel cells in demanding applications. The aim of this study is to investigate the electrochemical activity of Ag-based oxides, Ag2XO4 (where X = Cr, Mo, and W), to be used as a catalyst material in these applications. In this regard, precipitation and/or hydrothermal methods were used to synthesize powders without impurities. Structural characterizations were performed by SEM and XRD prior to use of synthesized powders. Then, linear sweep voltammograms of catalysts loaded rotating disk electrode and gas diffusion layer were investigated via a three-electrode cell in 0.1 M and 6 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. The most promising results were obtained from Ag2WO4 powders. The onset and half-wave potentials of the ORR for the Ag2WO4 catalyst were 930 mV and 710 mV RHE, respectively. Moreover, the electron transfer number, Tafel slope, limiting current density and overpotential at -3 mA cm(-2) current density for Ag2WO4 were 3.8, 47, 5 mA cm(g)(eo)(-2) and 540 mV, respectively. The results presented revealed that the hydrothermally synthesized Ag2WO4 might be a possible ORR catalyst. The stability of Ag2WO4 was verified by chronoamperometry and accelerated durability tests. Synthesized powders were compared with the commercially purchased 67 wt% Pt/C and synthesized alpha-MnO2 powders which having proven activity for ORR.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000561567300047

We studied the local structure changes of perovskites LaCoO3, Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta before and after OER by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. No change in either local structure or OER activity was observed for LaCoO3, while considerably enhanced OER activities and the conversion of the local structure from corner sharing octahedra to edge sharing octahedra were noted for Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta and SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta as a result of the OER.

However, these batteries still suffer from many critical issues, such as low capacity, poor cycle life, and low round-trip efficiency, rendering the practical application of these batteries rather sluggish. Cathode catalysts with high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and evolution reaction activities are of particular importance for addressing these issues and consequently promoting the application of Li-O-2 batteries. Thus, the rational design and preparation of the catalysts with high ORR activity, good electronic conductivity, and decent chemical/electrochemical stability are still challenging. In this Review, the strategies are outlined including the rational selection of catalytic species, the introduction of a 3D porous structure, the formation of functional composites, and the heteroatom doping which succeeded in the design of high-performance cathode catalysts for stable Li-O-2 batteries. Perspectives on enhancing the overall electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries based on the optimization of the properties and reliability of each part of the battery are also made. This Review sheds some new light on the design of highly active cathode catalysts and the development of high-performance lithium-O-2 batteries.									85	9	0	0	1	0	88			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000437695800004	29750439

In photosynthetic dinoflagellates that live in symbiosis with cnidarians, the nature and relative amplitude of these regulatory mechanisms are a matter of debate. In our study, the amplitude of photosynthetic alternative electron flows (AEF) to oxygen (chlororespiration, Mehler reaction), the mitochondrial respiration and the Photosystem I (PSI) cyclic electron flow were investigated in strains belonging to three clades (A1, B1 and F1) of Symbiodinium.Cultured Symbiodinium strains were maintained under identical environmental conditions, and measurements of oxygen evolution, fluorescence emission and absorption changes at specific wavelengths were used to evaluate PSI and PSII electron transfer rates (ETR).A light- and O-2-dependent ETR was observed in all strains. This electron transfer chain involves PSII and PSI and is insensitive to inhibitors of mitochondrial activity and carbon fixation.We demonstrate that in all strains, the Mehler reaction responsible for photoreduction of oxygen by the PSI under high light, is the main AEF at the onset and at the steady state of photosynthesis. This sustained photosynthetic AEF under high light intensities acts as a photoprotective mechanism and leads to an increase of the ATP/NADPH ratio.									87	0	0	0	81	1	89			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000341193500011	24975027

Herein, we demonstrated a versatile strategy to activate and stabilize RuO2-based electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting by a trace of Pt, where Pt plays an essential role in promoting oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and can simultaneously act as the active site for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared with pure Ru oxide nanosheet assemblies (Ru ONAs), the "5%Pt-containing" Ru ONAs (5%Pt-Ru ONAs) achieve much enhanced OER activity in 0.5 and 0.05 mol/L H2SO4, with much lower overpotentials of 227 and 234 mV at 10 mA cm???2, respectively. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the atomically dispersed Pt incorporating into RuO2 lattice is conducive to increasing the concentration of O vacancies, which effectively enhances the interaction with reaction intermediate and thus lowers the energy barrier for the formation of OOH*. Moreover, benefited from the presence of Pt, the formation of RuO2 is more achievable when proper annealing is applied. In addition to OER, due to the presence of active Pt, the HER performance of 5%Pt-Ru ONAs can also be ensured, thereby realizing efficient acidic overall water splitting. Finally, the excellent activity can also be achieved without sacrificing stability. This work highlights an attractive strategy for designing active and stable RuO2-based electrocatalysts for acidic overall water splitting.

Herein, we report a universal avenue to synthesize alloys of Co encapsulated within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) polyhedra along with short carbon nanotubes (CNTs) derived from the metal-organic framework (MOF). The reported synthesis stands out being an environmentally benign way to synthesize such hybrids in situ since it is a one-step, hydrogen-free method and uses a single source precursor that successfully overcomes the hurdles of traditional synthesis methods. The as-synthesized MCo@NC (M = Pt, Pd, Ru) shows bifunctional catalytic activity competing with the state-of-the-art catalyst Pt/C (20 wt%) and RuO2 towards the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), respectively, in alkaline media. The best HER activity is observed for PtCo@NC (E@10 mA cm(-2) = 38 mV), whereas the best OER activity is observed for RuCo@NC (E@10 mA cm(-2) = 280 mV). A total water splitting electrolyzer set up with PtCo@NC||RuCo@NC (cathode||anode) showed an impressive 1.52 V of onset potential. A synergistic effect between the bimetallic MCo@NC moiety, Co-N-x centers, and Co nanoparticles wrapped in N-doped graphitic layers (Co@NC) is believed to be the cause for enhanced catalytic activity.									32	2	0	0	2	0	32			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000589891500017

Considering overall water splitting for practical applications, catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) should be performed in the same electrolyte, especially in alkaline solutions. However, designing and searching for highly active and inexpensive electrocatalysts for both OER and HER in basic media remain significant challenges. Herein, we report a facile and universal strategy for synthesizing nonprecious transition metals, binary alloys, and ternary alloys encapsulated in graphene layers by direct annealing of metal-organic frameworks. Density functional theory calculations prove that with an increase in the degree of freedom of alloys or a change in the metal proportions in FeCoNi ternary alloys, the electronic structures of materials can also be tuned intentionally by changing the number of transferred electrons between alloys and graphene. The optimal material alloys FeCo and FeCoNi exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 149 mV for HER and 288 mV for OER.

When electrodeposited on ITO/FTO electrodes it forms acetate bound cobalt(II)-oxide materials (Co-Ac-WOC) showing a catalytic current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) at 830 mV and 1 mA cm(-2) at 1 V in a pH 7 buffer solution. The morphology of Co-Ac-WOC and its evolution with time and deposition potential is investigated with AFM, HR-TEM and SEM. The chemical composition of Co-Ac-WOC is investigated using XPS, EDX, ATR-FTIR and combustion analysis which indicate that this material has a CoO core with chloride and acetate anions bound to the Co center. Sodium is found to be integrated in the Co-Ac-WOC. The presence of the sodium and chloride ions lowers the onset potential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by 240 mV relative to the classic Co-Pi at pH 7. The lower onset potential and higher OER current lowers the exchange current density to 10(-6.7) A cm(-2) in Co-Ac-WOC relative to 10(-8)-10(-10) A cm(-2) in Co-Pi and its derivatives.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000337122000042	24819564

The results are interpreted as due to strong adsorption of phosphate on the oxide blocking active sites for intermediates in the OER by phosphoric acid moieties. Anions also appear to be involved in the intercalation processes of both forms of the oxide. The mass changes observed for oxide powder during intercalation in phosphoric acid were twice those in perchloric acid. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the effect of doping different ions on water splitting performance has not been systematically clarified. Therefore, a detailed research is done to illuminate the doping of different ions on the water splitting performance of spinel cobalt sulfide MCo2S4 (M = Ni, Cu and Co) nanorods grown on Ni foam. To drive the electrocatalytic current of 50 mA/cm(2) and 10 mA/ cm(2), the CuCo2S4/NF material only requires an overpotential of 240 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 142 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The results of density functional theory and experiment demonstrate that the strong water adsorption energy and the large electrochemical activity area make CuCo2S4/NF show good catalytic activity. The CuCo2S4/NF nanorods material presents superior electrochemistry performance with a small voltage 1.53 V. The water oxidation activity increases linearly before nonlinearly improving with the increasing of pH, indicating that the substrate changes from water to hydroxyl. It is noteworthy that CuCo2S4/NF will be transformed into amorphous oxide active species, which will act as a stable catalyst during the reaction. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

We investigate the relative stability of different surface terminations of TiO2 interacting with H2O and analyze the overpotential needed for the electrolysis and photoelectrolysis of water. We found that the most difficult step in the splitting of water process is the reaction of a H2O molecule with a vacancy in the surface to form an adsorbed hydroxyl group (OH*). Comparison to experiment shows that the computed overpotential for O-2 evolution (0.78 V) is available under the experimental conditions required for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution.									435	15	0	0	31	0	438			1932-7447			WOS:000257155200049

Herein, a simple self-derivation method is used to fabricate a Fe-doped Ni3S2 electrode. The electrode exhibits an impressive trifunctional catalyst, with low overpotentials of 290, 198, and 254 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The durability is higher than 3500 h (146 days) at 100 mA cm(-2) for the OER without obvious change. In situ Raman spectra reveal the incorporation of Fe inhibited S dissolution and facilitates the catalyst reconstruction. The density functional theory calculations indicate that the doping of Fe optimizes the adsorption of the rate-determining step and the d-band center is closer to the Fermi level, which accelerates the OER process. The two-electrode electrolyzer needs the cell voltages of only 1.76 and 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) and remarkable durability for more than 500 h at 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) for overall water and urea splitting. This work holds great promise for industrial water and urea splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000843372400001

Herein, a multistep methodology to follow the synthesis of templated supported metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on iron-doped copper-cobalt selenide on hollow carbon nanofiber mats (Fe-doped MOF CuCoSe@HCNFs) is utilized as a trifunctional electrocatalyst. As a synthesis of nanoporous electrocatalysts, oxyhydroxide metals are commonly used as a sacrificial template for the development of a porous carbon network. The as-synthesized materials are completely characterized, showing that the templated MOFs exhibit a significant impact on the porous carbon network, surface area, surface defects, and interfacial charge transfer. The superior trifunctional electrocatalyst of the Fe-doped MOF CuCoSe@HCNF nanostructure possesses excellent electrochemical activity toward the OER with an overpotential of 260 mV @ 20 mA cm-2, HER with an overpotential of 181 mV @ 10 mA cm-2, and ORR E1/2 with a potential of 0.756 V vs RHE. The outstanding activities of the Fe-doped MOF CuCoSe@HCNF nanostructure are mainly due to their distinctive structural features, leading to favorable electron transfer between the electrode and electrolyte interface to achieve successful trifunctional water splitting electrocatalysis.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663202100004

During annealing, the 827 cm(-1) VO defect band decreases, and another band at 885 cm(-1) generally attributed to the VO2 centre increases. The kinetics of the evolution of these two defects was investigated. The decay of VO is dominated by a second-order reaction (VO + Si-i --> O-i) with an activation energy 1.70 eV. The growth of VO2 exhibits two stages. Below 360 degrees C, a first-order reaction (VO + O-i --> VO2) with an activating energy of 1.46 eV or a second-order reaction (VO + VO --> VO2 + V) with an activation energy of 1.96 eV could fit the data. The two cases are considered and discussed. The analysis goes further taking into account the more realistic case that both reactions occur in parallel. Values of 2.1 and 2.0 eV were derived, respectively. Above 360 degrees C, the phenomenon is not well understood, as other factors might also be at work which manifest their presence more profoundly above this temperature.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0031-8965			WOS:A1997YE41300007

In this work, we have designed bilayer two dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) MoTe2/XS2 (X = Hf,Sn,Zr) heterostructures and studied their electronic, optical properties and photocatalytic activities. According to the hybrid density functional computations, these heterojunctions have been found to be stable and potential candidates for direct Z-scheme photocatalysts, where MoTe2 and XS2 layers can be used for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Compared with the MoTe2 and XS2 monolayers, MoTe2/XS2 (X = Hf,Sn, Zr) heterostructures with internal electric fields can achieve high-efficiency carriers separation. Meanwhile, these nanocomposites with narrower bandgaps are able to make the best of the sunlight even in the visible light (VIS) region, which is good for enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, these results have paved the way for exploring efficient MoTe2-based photocatalysts for overall water splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618291300007

In this work, the novel amorphous iron-nickel phosphide (FeP-Ni) nanocone arrays as efficient bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting have been in-situ assembled on conductive three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam via a facile and mild liquid deposition process. It is found that the FeP-Ni electrode demonstrates highly efficient electrocatalytic performance toward overall water splitting. In 1 M KOH electrolyte, the optimal FeP-Ni electrode drives a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 218 mV for the OER and 120 mV for the HER, and can attain such current density for 25 h without performance regression. Moreover, a two-electrode electrolyzer comprising the FeP-Ni electrodes can afford 10 mA cm(-2) electrolysis current at a low cell voltage of 1.62 V and maintain long-term stability, as well as superior to that of the coupled RuO2/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF cell. Detailed characterizations confirm that the excellent electrocatalytic performances for water splitting are attributed to the unique 3D morphology of nanocone arrays, which could expose more surface active sites, facilitate electrolyte diffusion, and benefit charge transfer and also favorable bubble detachment behavior. Our work presents a facile and cost-effective pathway to design and develop active self-supported electrodes with novel 3D morphology for water electrolysis.

However, its real application is yet hindered owing to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts. Herein, we propose a plasmon activation approach for the acceleration of the OER on a Au nanorod-2D ultrathin metal-organic framework (NiCo-MOF) hybrid. The plasmon-generated hot holes of Au nanorods (AuNRs) can be injected into the nickel active sites of the OER catalyst, significantly increasing the generation of high valence Ni* active species in NiCo-MOFs with better matched energy levels for the OER, in turn decreasing the OER activation energy. Thus, excellent OER performance of the NiCo-MOFs under surface plasmon resonance of AuNRs is achieved with an overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm 2 and a Tafel slope of 69 mV dec 1, which is much better than that of the reported catalysts. This finding highlights the importance of noble metal LSPR in facilitating the OER performance of MOFs and opens up a new avenue for improving the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of pristine MOFs.									37	7	0	0	2	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200047

Smart control of the composition of a B-site ordered double perovskite can lead to improved catalytic performance. By adopting a facile co-doping strategy, the OER-active elements are simultaneously introduced into the B-site and B '-site of a B-site-ordered double perovskite (A(2)BB ' O-6), leading to an enhancement of the exposed reactive sites and an optimum surface chemical state. As a result, a model system built from the substitution of Co for Mo and Fe in the Sr2FeMoO6-delta double perovskite (with a composition of Sr2Fe0.8Co0.2Mo0.6Co0.4O6-delta) shows significantly enhanced OER activity in alkaline media compared with the host material, requiring an overpotential of 345 mV to reach a 10 mA cm(-2) current density (catalyst loading approximate to 0.232 mg(cat) cm(GEO)(-2)) and a cell voltage of 1.57 V to afford the same current density for the overall water splitting when coupled with a Pt/C cathode (catalyst loading approximate to 2 mg cm(-2)). It also demonstrates excellent electrochemical stability. The generalizability of the compositional control methodology has also been demonstrated in double perovskites incorporating transition metals other than Co (e.g., Ni).									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000490952200001	31529674

The oxygen potential distributions induce the reduction strains in oxide materials along with the thermal strains due to temperature change. These strains cause the macroscopic deformation in mutually constrained components. The capability of the proposed method is demonstrated in characterizing the aging degradation of the macroscopic electro-chemo-mechanical behaviour of SOFC that is caused by the Nisintering in anode microstructures during long-period control.					1st Pan-American Congress on Computational Mechanics (PANACM) / XI Argentine Congress on Computational Mechanics (MECOM)1st Pan-American Congress on Computational Mechanics (PANACM) / XI Argentine Congress on Computational Mechanics (MECOM)	APR 27-29, 2015APR 27-29, 2015		Buenos Aires, ARGENTINABuenos Aires, ARGENTINA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-84-943928-2-5	WOS:000380586300018

Two common strategies to achieve high electrocatalytic performance for SACs are to enhance the intrinsic activity by modulating the electronic structure of active sites and to incorporate more single active sites by increasing the metal loading. In this review, we have summarized the key advances in ORR electrocatalysis of carbon-supported heterogeneous catalysts with atomically dispersed metal sites during the past decade, mainly focusing on the modulation of the electronic structure and the elevation of metal loading, and the operando/ex situ characterization techniques of the electronic structure evolution of SACs during the ORR process have also been highlighted. Meanwhile, the underlying formation mechanism of SACs has also been discussed in detail for both "bottom-up" and "top-down" approaches. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of carbon-supported SACs for ORR-related energy devices have been outlined. Hopefully, this timely review will provide an insightful roadmap for the future research of SACs.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000674286900001

Here, a facile and novel one-step approach of growing 3D hierarchical nickel nitride (hNi(3)N) on Ni foam via nitrogen plasma is reported. Different from most conventional chemical synthesis, the hNi(3)N is obtained in much shorter growth duration (15 min) without any hazardous or reactive sources and oxide precursors at a moderate reaction zone temperature of 450 degrees C. Among possible multifunctionalities of the obtained nanocoral hNi(3)N, herein the performance in reversible lithium ion storage and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. The as-obtained hNi(3)N delivers a considerable cycling performance and rate stability as a lithium ion battery anode, and its property can be further enhanced by coating the hNi(3)N surface with graphene quantum dots. The hNi(3)N also serves as an active OER catalyst with high activity and stability. Additionally, on the basis of controlled growth under different nitrogen plasma treatment time, the formation mechanism of the nanocoralline hNi(3)N is outlined for further extension to other materials. The results on time- and energy-efficient nitrogen-plasma-based preparation of hNi(3)N pave the way for the development of high-performance metal nitride electrodes for energy storage and conversion.									151	4	0	0	16	0	151			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000409446800001	28682457

We show that a detailed chemical reaction model has a profound effect on the spontaneous wave concept for detonation initiation by a gradient of reactivity. The evolution to detonation due to a temperature gradient is considered for hydrogen-oxygen and hydrogen-air mixtures at different initial pressures. It is shown that the minimal length of the temperature gradient for which a detonation can be ignited is much larger than that predicted from a one-step chemical model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	BRICKER, TM								OXYGEN EVOLUTION IN THE ABSENCE OF THE 33-KILODALTON MANGANESE-STABILIZING PROTEIN								BIOCHEMISTRY				31	19			4623	4628		10.1021/bi00134a012				MAY 19 1992	1992	There has been a considerable amount of controversy concerning the ability of photosystem II to evolve oxygen in the absence of the 33-kDa, manganese-stabilizing protein. Early reports indicated that some capacity for oxygen evolution existed in manganese-stabilizing protein-depleted membranes while more recent studies have suggested that the observed oxygen evolution activity arose from residual manganese-stabilizing protein present in the salt-washed preparations. In this paper, it is conclusively demonstrated that significant rates of steady-state oxygen evolution are observed in oxygen-evolving photosystem II membranes in the absence of detectable quantities of the manganese-stabilizing protein. More then 99% of the manganese-stabilizing protein was removed by either one CaCl2 or two NaCl-urea washes. The amount of manganese-stabilizing protein removed was quantified immunologically using mouse polyclonal antibodies. Oxygen evolution rates of 115-140-mu-mol Of O2 (Mg Of Chl)-1 h-1 were observed in the NaCl-urea-washed preparations. These rates represent about 24% of the rate observed in untreated membranes [450-600-mu-mol of O2 (mg of Chl)-1 h-1]. Somewhat lower, although still significant rates were observed in the CaCl2-washed preparations. Optimal rates of oxygen-evolving activity in NaCl-urea-washed membranes which are devoid of the manganese-stabilizing protein required high concentrations of calcium and chloride.									121	5	2	0	112	0	125			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HV19000012	1581313

Here we investigated the crystal-plane-dependent electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2O4 crystals by combining experimental studies and theoretical calculations for the first time. It is revealed that NiCo2O4 nanosheet exposing {1 1 0} crystal planes shows higher catalytic activity for both HER and OER than that of NiCo2O4 octahedron exposing {1 1 1} crystal planes and NiCo2O4 truncated octahedron exposing {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} crystal planes. Furthermore, we grew the nanosheet with {1 1 0} planes on nickel foam (NF), which could guarantee fast electron and ion transport, rapid release of evolved bubbles and good structural stability, leading to the improved electrochemical performance. Acting as both anode and cathode electrocatalysts with a two-electrode electrolyzer in alkaline medium, NiCo2O4 nanosheet array produced a small cell voltage of 1.59 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The research presented here is of both fundamental and instructional significance because it unveils that selectively exposing specific crystal planes is very effective to receive promising catalysts for overall water splitting.

The first part is devoted to optimization of a new citrate bath for the development of an efficient electroactive Ni-P electrode material by electrodeposition, using glycerol as an additive. The Ni-P alloys developed at 4.0 A dm(-2) and 2.0 A dm(-2) were found to be good for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP) methods. The Ni-P alloy showing good catalytic activity for HER is found to be less active for OER and vice versa. The unique electrocatalytic property of the coatings was attributed to its structure, morphology and composition, confirmed by XRD, SEM and EDS analyses. In the second part, the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-P alloy coatings for HER has been improved further by anodic dissolution and TiO2 nanoparticle incorporation. Drastic improvement in the electrocatalytic activity for HER was found in both anodically treated and Ni-P-TiO2 composite coatings, compared to as-coated Ni-P alloys. The highest electrocatalytic character of the Ni-P-TiO2 composite coating was attributed to a greater number of electroactive centres, affected by TiO2 nanoparticle incorporation, and experimental results are discussed.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000379577800107

However, MXenes exhibit inadequate catalytic activity for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) because they are typically terminated with inactive functional groups, F* and OH*, which mask the active metal sites for N-2 binding. Here we modified the surface termination of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets to achieve high surface catalytic reactivity for the NRR by ironing out inactive F*/OH* terminals to expose more active sites and by introducing Fe to greatly reduce the surface work function. The optimally performing catalyst (MXene/TiFeOx-700) achieved excellent Faradaic efficiency of 25.44% and an NH3 yield rate of 2.19 mu g/cm(2).h (21.9 mu g/mg(cat).h), outperforming all reported MXene-based NRR catalysts. Our work provides a feasible strategy for rationally improving the surface reactivity of MXene-based catalysts for efficient electrochemical conversion of N-2 to NH3.									79	5	0	0	5	0	78			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000557762800129	32551498

EI and CV studies indicated that the incorporation of oxide nanoparticles influenced the charge transfer and transport behaviours of the polymer matrix greatly. The bulk electrical resistances of pure polymer (4.5 +/- 1.7 Omega) as well as composite (2.7 +/- 0.8 Omega) electrodes were practically constant in the potential region, +0.1 to -0.7 V. The latter electrode showed a good electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).

Herein monodisperse Mn3O4 spherical nanoparticles were self-assembled into hierarchical flakes and cubes by regulating the surfactant metal precursor molar ratio, reaction atmosphere, and time. The secondary phase of Mn3O4 was incorporated differently, depending on the type of self-assembly as 2, 3.5, and 6.5 wt % in the flake, spherical, and cubic morphologies, respectively. The highest percentage of Mn3O4 in the cubes boosts its multifunctionality in terms of enhanced magnetic exchange coupling and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. With a 2 T cooling field, the hysteresis loop shift corresponding to coupling between antiferromagnetic Mn3O4 and ferrimagnetic Mn3O4 reached 3813 +/- 2 Oe for the cubes, which is a record high for any reported Mn3O4-Mn3O4 system. The presence of a e(g)(1) electron due to a higher Mn3O4 fraction in the cubes facilitated high structural flexibility for optimum strength of interaction between the catalyst and intermediate ions during OER. Likewise, a current density 10 mA cm(-2) was reached at an overpotential of 0.946 +/- 0.02 V for the cubes, which is to superior those of the spherical morphology and flakes.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000416202900077

In this study, a composition-controlled partial sulfurization/phosphorization strategy to synthesize a doughnut-like 3D heterostructured electrocatalyst for overall water splitting is proposed, wherein core-shell 2D CoS(1-x)P(x)nanosheets decorated with N-doped carbon are self-assembled to form a hierarchical 3D architecture. The composition and phase structure in core-shell CoS(1-x)P(x)can be readily modified by controlling the liquid phase sulfurization and subsequent phosphorization, thereby modifying the electronic structure and activating the intrinsic active sites. The resulting CoS(1-x)P(x)benefits from the unique structural features including high accessible active surface area, adequate amount of reactive sites, intimate interfacial coupling between the components, interconnected electron highway, and accelerated charge/mass transfer ability. Consequently, the optimized CoS(0.46)P(0.54)electrocatalyst achieves a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at overpotentials as low as 101 and 302 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, with outstanding long-term operational stability in alkaline solution. The CoS(0.46)P(0.54)couple enables an alkaline water electrolysis with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a low cell voltage of 1.62 V, comparable to that of the RuO2||Pt/C couple (1.6 V).									26	1	0	0	3	0	26			2366-9608			WOS:000549834800003

Herein, CoxNi10-x, layer double hydroxide salts with controllable structure and morphology induced by 2-methylimidazole to derive ZIF-67 on Ni/Fe foam is reported. The asprepared 3D CoxNi10-x, layer double hydroxide microspheres are constructed by self-assembly of 2D nanoflake and 1D nanorod with ZIF-67 particles due to the double influence of Ni and 2-methylimidazole. It is discovered that the Ni and 2-methylimidazole can simultaneously modulate morphology and structure of CoxNi10-x layer double hydroxide to distinctly increase the electrochemical active surface area for exposing more accessible active sites. Notably, the 3D microsphere heterogeneous catalysis of the self-assembly combines the merits of low dimensions (1D and 2D) materials, providing high structural void porosity and fast charge transport channels. Particularly, the Co7Ni3 layer double hydroxide salts@ZIF-67/Ni/Fe foam exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity with the lower overpotentials of 260 and 165 mV toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The outstanding activity originates from the strong electronic coupling between the 3D microsphere and ZIF-67. This work can bring a new prospect for fabricating highly-active and new structure electrocatalysts.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000447555400016

This cell design enables in situ XAS investigations of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at high operating current densities greater than 1 mA in an oxygen-purged environment. When the cell was used to study the ORR for a Pt on carbon electrocatalyst, the data revealed a progressive evolution of the electronic structure of the metal clusters that is both potential-dependent and strongly current-dependent. The trends establish a direct correlation to d-state occupancies that directly tracks the character of the Pt-O bonding present.									61	2	0	0	4	0	61			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000301084200052	22188603

The reactions at 500 and 550 degrees C in 0.5% O-2 led to the formation of well-defined oxide p-n junction nanostructures such as Co3O4-decorated ZnO nanobelts and ZnO-ZnCo2O4 core-shell nanocables, respectively, as the reaction intermediates.

Here, novel short needle-like complex oxides of NixCu1-x/CuO/Ni(OH)(2) are rationally designed and synthesized to further promote their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Under the tuning of electron perturbation and surface morphology, Ni0.7Cu0.3/CuO/Ni(OH)(2) reached an optimum performance of similar to 136.6 mV(RHE) kinetic potential and similar to 160 mV(RHE) (vs. 3.33 A g(-1)) over-potential with a Tafel slope of 66 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the complex oxides are directly grown on glass carbon, which works as a binder-free and carbon-free electrode, leading to an excellent stability of 200 000 s with 39% activity loss. Due to the electron perturbation role of Cu as well as the synergistic interactions among Ni-Cu, CuO and Ni(OH)(2), the obtained Ni0.7Cu0.3/CuO/Ni(OH)(2) complex oxide is significantly more active and stable than those of NixCu1-x alloy, CuO and Ni(OH)(2).

The coating of the copper-based metal-organic framework resulted in the hybridization of the copper-embedded protective carbon shell layer with Co3O4 to create a strong Cu-O-Co bonding interaction for efficient hydrogen adsorp-tion. The hybridization also led to electronically induced oxygen defects and nitrogen doping to effectively enhance the electrical conductivity of Co3O4. The optimal as-prepared core-shell hybrid material displayed excellent overall-water-splitting catalytic activity that required overall voltages of 1.45 and 1.57 V to reach onset and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. This is the first report to highlight the relevance of hybridizing MOF-based co-catalysts to boost the electrocatalytic performance of nonprecious transition-metal oxides.									52	4	0	0	1	0	52			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000471036800017	30892755	
J	Ji, Jiapeng; Hou, Yunpeng; Zhou, Shiyu; Qiu, Tong; Zhang, Liang; Ma, Lu; Qian, Chao; Zhou, Shaodong; Liang, Chengdu; Ling, Min								Oxygen-coordinated low-nucleus cluster catalysts for enhanced electrocatalytic water oxidation								CARBON ENERGY											10.1002/cey2.216		JUL 2022			2022	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of single-atom catalysts (SACs) is closely related to the coordination environment of the active site. Oxygen-coordinated atomic metal species bring about unique features beyond nitrogen-coordinated atomic metal species due to the fact that the M-O bond is weaker than the M-N bond. Herein, a series of metal-oxygen-carbon structured low-nucleus clusters (LNCs) are successfully anchored on the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (M-MWCNTs, M = Ni, Co, or Fe) through a foolproof low-temperature gas transfer (300 degrees C) method without any further treatment. The morphology and coordination configuration of the LNCs at the atomic level were confirmed by comprehensive characterizations. The synthetic Ni-MWCNTs electrocatalyst features excellent OER activity and stability under alkaline conditions, transcending the performances of Co-MWCNTs, Fe-MWCNTs and RuO2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the moderate oxidation of low-nucleus Ni clusters changes the unoccupied orbital of Ni atoms, thereby lowering the energy barrier of the OER rate-limiting step and making the OER process more energy-efficient. This study demonstrates a novel versatile platform for large-scale manufacturing of oxygen-coordinated LNC catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2637-9368		WOS:000826778100001

In this study, cation vacancies (V-Zn) were proposed as new active sites on the ZnS surfaCe. With no cocatalyst, the V-Zn-rich ZnS acquired a high selectivity of formate production (>85%) in inorganic aqueous solution. In situ attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy and first-principle calculations have clarified the CO2RR pathways into formate and proved that the surface V-Zn could greatly lower the barrier of CO2RR and suppress the proton adsorption, elucidating the origin of the highly selective CO2RR in the presence of competitive HER. This work gives an in-depth understanding of the cation vacancies and inspiration to develop efficient photocatalysts.									59	4	0	0	2	0	61			2380-8195			WOS:000472121800023

A 30% enhancement in photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs RHE was measured despite a nominal change in onset potential. A structural and electrochemical analysis of the films before and after exposure to UV irradiation indicates that a higher film porosity and correspondingly higher specific surface area is responsible for the enhancement in PEC activity. The effect of prolonged UV irradiation on the WO3 films is fundamentally different to that which was previously observed for BiVO4 films.									20	1	0	0	1	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000384518500006	27644107

Copper delafossite oxides (CuBO2, B = transition metal) were investigated for their potential as OER catalysts using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To identify an appropriate descriptor for OER activity, we examined the relationships between the caltulated e(g) or t(2g) occupancy of the B site and the experimentally determined OER activity. The calculated t(2g) occupancy was found to be approximately linearly related to OER activity. We therefore propose that t(2g) occupancy can be employed as an appropriate descriptor of the electron occupancy of active sites, estimated using theoretical calculations, can oxide catalysts with high OER activity.									38	0	0	0	0	0	38			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000351970800006

While the operational potential window is dictated by the intrinsic electrochemical stability of water (1.23 V), such a bottleneck may be surpassed by leveraging the additional overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, by employing an electroreduction technique, Na+ is adsorbed onto the carbon negative electrode which effectively acts as a physical barrier to hinder intermediate HER product formation, thereby reducing HER activity. To complement the wide potential carbon electrode, Na0.25MnO2 is employed as the positive electrode to take advantage of the extra energy (i.e., increased overpotential) required for Na+ insertion process into the structure. The asymmetric supercapacitor exhibits high energy density of 61.1 W h kg(-1) at a power density of 982 W kg(-1), and even at an ultrahigh power density of 42.9 kW kg(-1), a respectable energy density of 16.3 W h kg(-1) is attained. In addition, 93.7% capacitance retention is recorded after cycling for 10 000 cycles which further demonstrates its suitability as supercapacitor. The present success in fabricating a 2.7 V asymmetric supercapacitor will open a promising research route toward achieving high energy density and high power density.									169	9	0	0	11	0	170			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000435713600022

The excellent HER, durability and stability of composite electrodes are due to chemical bonding immobilization of PtNPs on carbon materials and its substantial graphitized structure. Thus, CNH/DenPtNPs and CNT/DenPtNPs are the promising nano-electrocatalysts with low onset potential and high cathodic current density for HER and their high activities are achieved at only similar to 1 we,6 of PtNPs.

In this work, the electronic structure of graphene is well adjusted with hybridized halogen and oxyacid radical (SO4, SeO4, MoO4) groups, which improves its catalytic activity for water splitting. Especially, the G-SO4 shows high activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the catalytic activity of functionalized graphene is strongly dependent on the interfacial charge transfer and pz band center of carbon active sites. Generally, our work provides a new idea for predicting and designing potential carbon-based catalysts for overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729469900004

These investigations most commonly result into the construction of activity-based volcano plots in order to predict potential electrocatalysts for the application in practice. However, the prototypical activity-based volcano concept neither captures the influence of the applied overpotential on the activity nor the stability of electrode surfaces. Herein, the well-established volcano approach is expanded by constructing activity-stability volcano plots, which, beside the activity, also enclose the stability and the applied overpotential into the analysis.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000477986300013

Most research has focused so far on the OER at flat metal oxide surfaces. The structure sensitivity of the OER has, however, recently been highlighted as a promising research direction. To probe the structure sensitivity, we investigate the OER at 11 hematite (Fe2O3) surfaces with density functional theory + Hubbard U (DFT +U) calculations. The results show that the O-O coupling (O-O bond formation via two adjacent terminal Os at dual site) OER mechanism at the (110) surface is competing with the mechanism of 0011 formation at single site. We study the effects of surface orientation (110 vs 104), active surface sites (bridge vs terminal site), presence of surface steps and oxygen vacancy concentration on the OER and explore strategies to reduce the OER overpotential. It is found that the oxygen vacancy concentration is the most effective parameter-in reducing the overpotential. In particular, an overpotential of as low as 0.47 V is obtained for the (110) surface with an oxygen vacancy concentration of 1.26 vacancies/nm(2).									98	8	0	0	7	0	100			1932-7447			WOS:000381778000036

Herein, a novel Au/Ni3S2 heterostructure catalyst that was composed of self-supported Ni3S2 nanosheets decorated with Au nanoparticles on Ni foam was fabricated. The bifunctional catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic activities towards oxygen evolution reaction (230 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction (97 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH. The electrolytic tank using the bifunctional catalyst only required 1.52 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and sustained for 60 h, outperforming most of advanced bifunctional catalysts. The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations validated that the strong electronic coupling at the interface could modulate the electronic structure of Ni3S2, thereby optimizing the free energies of the adsorbed intermediates. This work provides an atomic-scale insight into the structure-properties relation of a promising heterostructure catalyst for water splitting.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000788166900005

For a specific composition, FeCo66.7Ni33.3B@B-VG electrocatalyst exhibits the highest electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction, with low overpotentials of 125 and 157 mV at eta (10) and small Tafel slopes of 52 and 47 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, respectively. FeCo66.7Ni33.3B@B-VG electrocatalyst displays remarkable catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction by showing low overpotentials of 200 and 569 mV at eta (10) and small Tafel slopes of 34 and 225 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, respectively. The result of stability test exhibits that FeCo66.7Ni33.3B@B-VG electrocatalyst has long-term stability for at least 10 h towards water splitting in a wide pH range. And the faraday efficiency of FeCo66.7Ni33.3B@B-VG towards water splitting is around 90%.

When oxygen vacancies were introduced into the perovskite, the color of NaNbO3 turned black and the band gap was decreased, resulting in its remarkable absorption under visible light, and its higher symmetry also favors the electron transfer. More importantly, oxygen vacancies lead to larger specific surface area and higher charge density, which play non-negligible roles in improving the visible-light-activities. These encouraging findings prove that oxygen vacancy engineering is a feasible and general strategy to improve the photocatalytic performances of perovskite oxides, which will promote many related applications.									17	3	0	0	2	0	18			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000472218500014	31134989

Much of the focus on anode catalyst development for polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) is centered on activity as controlled by compositional and morphological impacts on reactant/intermediate/product adsorption. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is found to be limited upon integration of these materials into PEMWE membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). Regardless of catalyst activity, the combination of electrode inhomogeneity, ionomer integration, and high density of oxide-oxide interfaces yields significant performance losses associated with poor catalytic electrode conductivity. Here many of these limitations are addressed through the development of a unique catalyst morphology composed of nanoporous Ir nanosheets (npIr(x)-NS) that exhibit high catalytic activity for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and superior electrode electronic conductivity in comparison to a commercial IrO2 nanoparticle catalyst. The utility of the npIr(x)-NS is demonstrated through incorporation into PEMWE MEAs where their performance exceeds that of commercial catalyst coated membranes at loadings as low as 0.06 mg(Ir) cm(-2) while exhibiting a negligible loss in performance following 50 000 accelerated stress test cycles.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000675292000001

Herein, a facile fabrication of a hierarchically porous carbon skeleton (HPCS), derived from renewable biomass precursor, as a novel cathodic material for nonaqueous LOBs is reported. The HPCS contains substantially cross-linked micro-, meso-, and macroporous channels, which can promote electron transfer, electrolyte infiltration, and oxygen diffusion, and also offers adequate room to store insoluble discharge products. The LOB developed using this rationally designed cathode material delivers a large capacity of 18 114 mA h g(-1) with a high discharge plateau of 2.80 V at 100 mA g(-1), which is much higher than that of commercial Super P. More importantly, HPCS can also act as a desirable matrix for other high-efficiency catalytic materials. For example, HPCS with in situ decorated IrCo nanoparticles (IrCo@HPCS) presents impressive ORR and OER catalytic performance in aqueous as well as non-aqueous media. IrCo@HPCS composite-based LOBs show a notably reduced discharge/charge overpotential, improved rate capability, and significantly enhanced stability over 200 cycles at 200 mA g(-1) with the capacity limitation of 1000 mA h g(-1). Furthermore, a possible nucleation mechanism of Li2O2 products with different morphologies on HPCS and IrCo@HPCS electrodes was also proposed and discussed.									27	2	0	0	3	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000472183200054

In this paper, we report a highly-efficient Co2P-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst that comprises Co2P and N,P co-doped carbon nanoparticles anchored within three-dimensional carbon nanofiber networks (denoted as Co2P-NPC/CF) through a toxic-free, one-pot synthesis involvingin situgrowth of Co-3(PO4)(2)-polydopamine/bacterial cellulose (BC) that can be transformed into Co2P-NPC/CF by a subsequent pyrolysis process. This catalyst exhibits a positive half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V for the oxygen reduction reaction, and a low operating potential of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2)(E-j10) for the oxygen evolution reaction, superior to the benchmark Pt/C (0.82 V) and RuO2(1.62 V) catalysts, respectively. The reversible oxygen electrode index (Delta E=E-j10-E-1/2) is just 0.75 V for Co2P-NPC/CF, surpassing those for the state-of-the-art noble-metal catalysts (Delta E= 0.80 V for Pt/C-RuO2) and most Co-based bifunctional catalysts ever reported. Furthermore, Co2P-NPC/CF-based primary Zn-air batteries can discharge at 10 mA cm(-2)for 110 h with a small voltage loss of 55 mV, and the maximum power density reaches 160 mW cm(-2); Co2P-NPC/CF-based rechargeable Zn-air batteries show a negligible voltage gap change after 160 charge-discharge cycles, much better than Pt/C-based batteries. The enhanced bicatalytic performance of this Co2P-based catalyst can be ascribed to the structural integration of Co2P NPs with CF networks and N,P co-doped carbon in a synergistic manner, where porous CF networks with a large specific surface area allow for uniform distribution and full exposure of dual active sites, and the simultaneous doping of P and N atoms in carbon could induce an enhanced coupling of Co2P NPs with N,P-codoped carbon. This work not only provides an easy and safe way to prepare excellent Co2P-based bifunctional catalysts for Zn-air batteries, but also demonstrates a viable structural integration strategy to offer reference for the design of multifunctional catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000556422000012

The synthesis of shape-controlled materials is helpful to design advanced electrode materials for supercapacitors. Herein, we prepared two types of NiCo2S4 with nano-bud and nano-mesh morphologies under hydrothermal conditions by facile controlling the reaction time. These materials display morphology-dependent electrochemical activity. Electrochemical measurements showed that the nano-mesh-like NiCo2S4 demonstrate the superior pseudocapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance (3.00 F cm(-2) or 1250 F g(-1) at 2 mA cm(-2)) and a favorable rate capability (77.8% from 2 to 25 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the specific capacitance remains 80% of its initial value after 5000 cycles even at high current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The mesh-like NiCo2S4 also displays a low overpotentials of 299 mV at the current density of 30 mA cm(-2), showing better performance in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000422993100060

Herein, a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with CoNi alloy nanoparticles supported by a butterfly wing-derived carbon framework (denoted as CoNi/BCF) was synthesized via a pyrolysis method. The obtained CoNi/BCF exhibited excellent oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability in terms of a positive halfwave potential (0.80 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential (370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Remarkably, the high bifunctional ORR/OER activity (Delta E(ORR-OER) = 0.80 V) also endows an excellent Zn-air battery performance with a high energy density of 853.1 mWh g(Zn)(-1), a peak power density of 155.1 mW cm(-2), and an excellent cyclability of over 180 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). The satisfactory electrocatalytic performance is due to the synergetic effect between CoNi alloy nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon framework, which includes the high conductivity, highly dispersed active sites and optimized electronic configuration and reaction pathways. Additionally, the smart structures of butterfly wings endow the hybrid catalyst with a large surface area, which is beneficial for the mass transfer, active sites exposure and the fixation of alloy nanoparticles. Our work presents a strategy to take full advantage of natural organisms, rich elements, and naturally optimized smart structures combined in a two-in-one solution, leading to significant improvements in the electrochemical performance. The realization of rechargeable Zn-air batteries also paves a new way for the design and development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage devices.									140	14	0	0	6	0	140			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000461002800019

BiOI with a microspherical morphology, a layered structure composed of [Bi2O2](2+) and intercalated I- ions, exhibited a suitable valence band level to generate photoexcited holes for O-2 evolution. Moreover, ruthenium was loaded using the impregnation or photodeposition method to produce RuO2 as a co-catalyst to improve the photocatalytic activity of BiOI. Photodeposited RuO2-loaded BiOI showed a high O-2 evolution rate of 2730 mu mol h(-1) and can be reused eight times in the presence of NaIO3 under simulated solar irradiation. The high photocatalytic O-2 evolution can be attributed to the highly dispersed RuO2, which could serve as an effective electron sink, on the surface of BiOI and its enhanced visible light-harvesting ability. Besides, the presence of NaIO3 in the system was effective to receive photoexcited electrons from RuO2-loaded BiOI for improving charge separation and hence the O-2 evolution from RuO2 sites on the BiOI surface. The RuO2-loaded BiOI with high photocatalytic activity and stability for generating O-2 could be a potential candidate for achieving overall water splitting in a Z-scheme system in the presence of NaIO3 for solar utilization in the future.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000538156300006

The process involves surface treatment of previously anodized SS meshes in different gaseous atmospheres. The activity of the resulted electrocatalysts varies as-anodized SS annealed in oxygen (ASS-O-2) > anodized SS annealed in hydrogen (ASS-H-2) > anodized SS annealed in air (ASS-Air). The ASS-O-2 showed an impressive low overpotential of 280 mV at the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which is 120 mV less than that of the as-received SS (SS-AR), and a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. These findings have also been asserted by the estimated electrochemical active surface area, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis, Mott-Schottky analysis, and the calculated turnover frequency, affirming the superiority of the ASS-O-2 electrocatalyst over the ASS-H-2 and ASS-Air counterparts. The high activity of the ASS-O-2 electrocatalyst can be ascribed to the surface composition that is rich in Fe3+ and Ni2+ as revealed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. The simple method of anodization and thermal annealing in O-2 at moderate conditions (450 degrees C for 1 h) lead to the formation of a SS mesh-based OER electrocatalyst with activity exceeding that of the state-of-the-art IrO2/RuO2 and other complex modified SS catalysts. These results were also confirmed via density functional theory calculations, which unveiled the OER reaction mechanism and elucidated the d-band center in different SS samples with different oxygen content. The presence of oxygen moved the d-band center closer to the Fermi level in the case of ASS-O-2, explaining its superior activity.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000821836200001

However, effect of less extreme reductive-annealing, where it allows to keep the crystal structure, on physical and chemical properties of MoO3 has not been well-studied. In this work, we studied the evolution of Mo valence state during reductive annealing and its effect on high temperature transport. We found the formation of oxygen vacancies on surface of MoO3 single crystals at the low temperature, which is evidenced by increase of Mo5+ and color change. In addition, formation of Mo4+ was at the elevated temperature. For understanding the relation between bulk conductivity and Mo valence state, real-time impedance spectroscopy is employed. Use of two different gases makes it possible to distinguish impedance responses of MoO3 from those of reduced MoO3-x. Also, from time-dependent impedance measurements, we observed the evolution of transport behaviour by evolution of Mo valence state.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1567-1739	1878-1675		WOS:000490123300013

In this work, N-doped pomelo-peel-derived carbon (NPC) materials were prepared using a widely available food waste-pomelo peels and melamine. The synthetic NPC exhibits well-defined porosities and a highly doped-N content (e.g. 6.38 at% for NPC-2), therefore affords excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities in alkaline electrolytes. NPC was further integrated with ZIF-67 to form ZIF-67@NPC hybrids through solvothermal reactions. The hybrid catalysts show substantially enhanced ORR catalytic activities comparable to that of commercial 20 wa Pt/C. Furthermore, the catalysts also exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activities. Among all prepared ZIF-67@NPC hybrids, the optimal composition with ZIF-67 to NPC ratio of 2:1 exhibits the best ORR and OER bifunctional catalytic performance and the smallest Delta E (E-OER@10 mA cm(-2)-E-ORR@-1 mA cm(-2)) value of 0.79 V. The catalyst also demonstrated desirable 4-electron transfer pathways and superior catalytic stabilities. The Co-N-4 in ZIF-67, electrochemical active surface area, and the strong interactions between ZIF-67 and NPC are attributed as the main contributors to the bifunctional catalytic activities. These factors act synergistically, resulting in substantially enhanced bifunctional catalytic activities and stabilities; consequently, this hybrid catalyst is among the best of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts and is promising for use in metal-air batteries and fuel cells.

Galvanostatic flow channel experiments were used to examine the current efficiency of the steel substrate. Below 6 A cm(-2) (zone A), oxygen evolution dominates, while at higher current densities iron dissolution prevails (zone C). Potentiodynamic polarization studies indicated a complete substrate surface passivation up to +1.8 V (vs NHE), and periodic fluctuations of the current density at higher anode potentials (> +1.8 V) due to severe oxygen evolution. Rotating cylinder measurements served for polarization studies at lower current densities in the region of dominating oxygen evolution. Scanning electron micrographs revealed a correlation between the current efficiency and the coverage of the substrate surface with an electronically conductive film at current densities of 2, 9 and 20 A cm(-2). The microstructure of the black, solid surface film developing during the high rate anodic dissolution of the steel was found to be heterogeneous and very porous. The main film components, as determined by X-ray diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopical measurements, were amorphous iron oxides, FexOy, and inert carbides, M3C, originating from the steel matrix. An activation-repassivation process is proposed, which is responsible for the development of the complex multilayer (multiphase) structure observed at the steel substrate surface.									15	2	0	0	0	0	17			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000224061300004

Herein, zeolite imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) polyhedron nanocrystals are used as N-containing carbonaceous precursors to synthesize N-rich hollow carbon cage composites with Co nanoparticles (Co@NHCC) in the presence of silica nanoparticles and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), an additional high-temperature decomposable nitrogen source. The assembly of dense silica nanoparticles on ZIF-67 surface may serve as hard encapsulation layers, which not only facilitates the incorporation of nitrogen atoms onto graphitized carbon skeletons, but also prevents the ZIF-67 polyhedrons from collapsing and effectively impedes the growth of carbon nanotubes during pyrolysis through surface confinement. Gasification in such an encapsulated environment concurrently generates abundant mesopores in the thin walls of carbonized ZIF-67 polyhedrons, which contributes to a high specific surface area of 910.71 m(2) g(-1) in the resulting Co@NHCC-800 sample, and hence endows an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst, with a half-wave potential of + 0.837 V for ORR in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution and a required potential of only +1.512 V to reach 10 mA cm -2 in OER catalysis. When used as a breathable electrode for Zn-air batteries, Co@NHCC-800 shows a much higher open-circuit voltage of 1.490 V, a higher discharge power density of 248 mW cm(-2) as well as a smaller increasement of only 0.100 V for the charge-discharge voltage gap after cycling for 12 h, as compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst. The results in present work pave a new avenue to the synthesis of sophisticated carbon nanomaterials for electrocatalysis.									71	4	0	0	4	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500007

A wide variety of materials have been reported as promising redox mediators for lithium-oxygen batteries, successfully enhancing energy efficiency and cycle stability. However, their overall performance still requires further improvement. Herein, recent progress on the use of redox mediators for lithium-oxygen batteries are reviewed, with a particular focus on improvements in energy efficiency, power capability, and coulombic efficiency. In addition, the aspects of redox mediators requiring immediate optimization are discussed together with future research directions.									34	1	0	0	0	0	34				2589-5974		WOS:000521129700008

Accordingly, efficient and large scale production of hydrogen is central issue due to high activation barrier unless costly transition metal catalysts are used. Here, we screen optimum catalysts toward hydrogen evolution among cheap pyrites using first-principles density functional theory calculations and rigorous thermodynamic approach. A key thermodynamic state variable accurately describes the catalytic activity, of which the mechanism is unveiled by a universal linear correlation between kinetic exchange current density in hydrogen evolution reaction and thermodynamic adsorption energy of hydrogen atom over various pyrites. On the basis of the results, we propose a design principle for substantial tuning the catalytic performance.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000424316200027

Experimental observations have shown that the microscopic mechanism underlying the alloying process in this system is the diffusion of Ni atoms in the Al-rich layers and that an important role is played by the oxygen contamination. An amorphous Al-rich phase containing a few at.% oxygen and with a Ni content not exceeding approximately 50 at.% has been detected in the equiatomic and Ni-rich samples milled for a few hours. This phase upon further milling transforms to a Ni-rich fee solid solution thus allowing one to by-pass the nucleation of AI,Ni in these samples. The self-sustaining high-temperature synthesis of the AlNi B2 phase has been found to occur over the 40-60 at.% range of Al concentration after about 3 h of milling. The same reaction has been observed in the Differential Scanning Calorimeter if equiatomic samples premilled for about 3h (unreacted) are heated at a sufficiently high heating rate.									52	3	0	0	1	0	53			1359-6454			WOS:A1996UD26500018

However, the application of these LDHs as high-performance electrocatalysts is often hindered by their relatively sluggish electronic transport kinetics resulting from their intrinsically low conductivity. Here, we report the effects of incorporating a metalloid into transition metal LDHs on their electrocatalytic activity. In this study, Te-incorporated NiCo LDH (chi Te-NiCo LDH) was grown on a three-dimensional porous nickel foam (NF) using a facile solvothermal method with chi = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. The crystal structure and surface nanostructure were investigated by X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. A homogeneous nanosheet structure on the NF was clearly observed for the NiCo LDH and chi Te-NiCo (chi = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) LDHs. However, irregular and collapsed nanostructures were found on the surface of the NF when the Te precursor ratio (chi) exceeded 0.6. The electrocatalytic OER properties were analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The amount of Te used in the electrocatalytic reaction was found to play a crucial role in improving the catalytic activity. The optimum Te amount (chi) introduced into the NiCo LDH is discussed with respect to the OER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1738-8228			WOS:000668050300007

Through the use of a favorable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathode, the projected electrical energy generated by a single pass ammonium bicarbonate reverse electrodialysis (RED) system approached 78 W h m(-3). However, if RED is operated with the less favorable (higher overpotential) hydrogen evolution electrode and hydrogen gas is harvested, the energy recovered increases by as much similar to 1.5 x to 118 W h m(-3). Indirect hydrogen production through coupling an RED stack with an external electrolysis system was only projected to achieve 35 W h m(-3) or similar to 1/3 of that produced through direct hydrogen generation.									48	2	0	0	5	0	51			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000328884900039	24322796

H and OH electrosorption reactions and a fast electrochemical process in the potential range preceding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were studied. For both electrolytes, as the temperature diminished, the H atom reactions and those reactions related to the O-containing surface species became increasingly irreversible, whereas the fast electrochemical process preceding the OER was nearly the same, irrespective of the temperature. Explanations recently advanced for the behaviour of Rh in more diluted solutions of the same acids at 298 K and the electrochemical behaviour of the different processes are discussed, considering mainly the effects of sulphate anion adsorption and perchlorate anion decomposition on Rh.									8	1	0	0	0	0	9			0022-0728			WOS:A1995RV56900029

Photocatalytic experiments revealed that 1 is an outstanding semiconducting material (E-g = 2.21 eV) for the degradation of methyl blue under UV light irradiation. Besides, electrocatalytic research showed that the 1@NF electrode shows better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance than RuO2@NF, reaching a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) when the overpotential of OER is 377 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte and the Tafel slope of 1@NF is 15.6 mV.dec(-1). Meanwhile, the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is 242 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), with the Tafel slope being 23.1 mV.dec(-1), also suggesting the HER performance of 1@NF is better than that of Pt/C@NF. The durability test showed the electrocatalytic activity of 1@NF was maintained at 90% after 12 h. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic properties show that 1 is an excellent candidate as a multifunctional material to solve environmental pollution and energy shortages.									73	0	1	0	18	0	73			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000672584000060

The model comprises transport equations derived from first principles for each phase. Void fraction distribution for both hydrogen and oxygen gases velocity of gas and liquid phases, concentration and current density distribution are calculated. It is found that gas fraction increases towards to the top of the cell. Gas phase confined regions at the vicinity of the electrodes. Gas release significantly affects the velocity profile in the system. The large density differences between two-phase generate flow which modify velocity profile. Gas release is enhanced at high current density however; gas layer accumulated on the electrode surface decreases the active reaction area which adversely affects the reaction rate.

Hydrogen energy, with the highest energy density and zero carbon emission, is considered a potential solution. Hydrogen is primarily produced by splitting water. Rationally designed electrocatalysts are required to promote the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Organic polymer matrices provide new opportunities for electrocatalytic water splitting due to their special physical and chemical characteristics and thermal stability. This article explains the role of organic polymers in electrocatalytic water decomposition from three aspects: ion-conductive polymers, conjugated conductive polymers, and carbon materials derived from organic polymers. We hope that this article will provide more rational ideas and promote the design of organic polymers for water-splitting electrocatalysis, and furnish more technical insights for the future of water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0883-7694	1938-1425		WOS:000548056800013

Here we report the synthesis of an oxygen-vacancy-rich CeO2/Ni heterostructure and its remarkable HOR performance in alkaline media. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the electron transfer between CeO2 and Ni could lead to thermoneutral adsorption free energies of H* (Delta G(H*)). This, together with the promoted OH* adsorption strength derived from the abundance of oxygen vacancies in the CeO2 species, contributes to the excellent HOR performance with the exchange current density and mass activity of 0.038 mA cm(Ni)(-2) and 12.28 mA mg(Ni)(-1), respectively. This presents a new benchmark for PGM-free alkaline HOR and opens a new avenue toward the rational design of high-performance PGM-free electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR.									130	9	0	0	13	0	131			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000482403600001	31359555

In this work, Fe and F ion co-doped Ni3S2 nanoarrays grown on Ni foam substrate were prepared by typical hydrothermal and sulfuration processes for the first time. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that the adsorption energy of the ma-terial to water is greatly enhanced due to the doping of F and Fe, which is conducive to the formation of intermediate species and the improvement of electrochemical perfor-mance of the electrode. The adsorption energy of anions (F and S) and cations (Fe and Ni) to water in each material was also calculated, and the results showed that F ion showed the most optimal adsorption energy of water, which proved that the doping of F and Fe was beneficial to improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode. It is worth noting that the surface of Fe-F-Ni3S2 material will undergo reconstruction during the process of water oxidation reaction and urea oxidation reaction, and amorphous oxides or hydroxides in situ would be formed on the surface of electrode, which are the real active species.

Here we prepared Bi(0.15)Sr(0.85)Co(1-x)FexO(3-delta) (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) perovskites by the conventional solid-state reaction route, and investigated their OER electrocatalytic activity and durability in 0.1 M KOH solution to reveal the critical role of A, B-site cations and oxygen vacancies. Results show the OER activity decreases with increasing x. The optimum composition, BiSC0.8F0.2, presents impressive electrocatalytic performances with low overpotential (330 mV on rotation disk electrode, and 283 mV on carbon paper electrode at 10 mA/cm2) and excellent long-time durability showing a small increase in the overpotential of 17 mV in 167.5 h. Comprehensive analysis and discussion on the bulk and surface properties reveal the critical role of A, B-site cations and oxygen vacancies on OER, and in-terrelations of Co2+ fraction, oxygen non-stoichiometry and the OER overpotential have been established. Most importantly, a highly A-site deficient surface layer is found on the as-synthesized perovskite, which facilitate OER by exposing more active B-site cations. This work not only reports a promising OER electrocatalyst with high activity and superior durability, but also provides perspectives on relational design for highly efficient and stable perovskite electrocatalysts for OER using solid-state reaction method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000851458000004

Thus, metal-semiconductor nanohybrids were developed with functionally integrating ORR-active Ni species, OER-active Fe/Fe3C components, and multifunctional N-doped carbon (NDC) support. Expectantly, the resulted NDC nanocage embedded with Ni-Fe alloy and Fe3C particles, as assembled Mott-Schottkytyped catalyst, delivered a promoted half-wave potential of 0.904 V for ORR and a low overpotential of 315 mV at 10 mA/cm2 for OER both in alkaline media, outperforming those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 counterparts. Most importantly, the optimized Ni-Fe/Fe3C@NDC sample also afforded a peak power density of 267.5 mW/cm2 with a specific capacity of 773.8 mAh/gZn and excellent durability over 80 h when used as the air electrode in rechargeable Zn-air batteries, superior to the state-of-the-art bifunctional catalysts. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the introduction of Ni into the Fe/Fe3C@NDC component could well manipulate the electronic structure of the designed electrocatalyst, leading to an effective built-in electric field established by the Mott-Schottky heterojunc- tion to expedite the continuous interfacial charge-transfer and thus significantly promote the utilization of electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, this work provides an avenue for the designing and developing robust and durable Mott-Schottky-typed bi-functional catalysts for promising energy conversion. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Two cluster models of the TM doped active sites which resemble both the TiO2 anatase (001) and rutile (110) surfaces are considered for the evaluation of the water decomposition reaction when a Ti is replaced by a TM atom. These models constitute a direct extension from our previous work in which similar representations were employed to address the water-splitting reaction on pure TiO2-based electrodes. Regarding the cluster structure as a simplified representation of an active site on the anode in the electrochemical cell, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is investigated using density functional theory (DFT). Simulations are carried out for a set of TMs spanning from vanadium to nickel. The proposed reaction pathways are evaluated via the variation of the free-energy profile with respect to the applied external bias. The late TMs explored in this work Fe, Co, and Ni-are found to reproduce the observed experimental trends for the overpotentials in TiO2 doped electrodes. In the case of Cr and Mn, the present study predicts an enhancement of the OER activity for the anatase-like clusters while a reduction of this activity is found for the rutile-like ones. Moreover, the vanadium-doped structures do not show relevant influence in the OER activity compared to pure TiO2-based cluster models.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1932-7447			WOS:000388429100022

As a kind of inorganic-organic hybrid materials, recently crystalline metalorganic frameworks (MOF) have been used as electrocatalysts in electrocatalytic reactions due to their abundant metal nodes and organic linkers, high porosity and large surface area. MOF thin films are crucial to achieve effective reactions due to their fast charge transfer and sufficient catalytic sites. Particularly, MOF thin films are coordinated on substrate surfaces by liquid phase epitaxial (LPE) layer by layer (LBL) growth method (called surface-coordinated MOF thin films, SURMOF), which recently have been studied in various fields due to their controlled thickness, preferred growth orientation and homogeneous surface. The backgrounds of electrocatalysis, MOF and SURMOF are briefly introduced at the beginning of this review. Then, the preparation and electrocatalytic applications of SURMOF and their derived thin films (SURMOF-D) are summarized respectively. Owing to the SURMOF based thin films tunable structures, controllable thickness and growth orientation, strong coordination interaction between MOF and substrate surface, and compact film, they can provide abundant catalytic sites and fast charge transfer for efficient electrocatalytic activities in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR), supercapacitor, tandem electrocatalysis and so on. At the end of the review, SURMOF and SURMOF-D for the electrocatalytic applications are also discussed on the current research challenges and problems to be solved.			设计和开发高效电催化剂对能源的存储和转化具有十分重要的意义。金属-有机框架(MOF)在基底表面通过液相外延层层配位组装的MOF薄膜(也被称作表面配位MOF薄膜, SURMOF)具有厚度可调节、生长取向可控以及表面均匀致密等优点,在电催化反应领域得到了广泛的研究和应用。本文总结了SURMOF及其衍生薄膜(SURMOF-D)的制备及其在电催化应用中的研究进展。由于SURMOF及其衍生薄膜具有结构多样性和功能可调节性,可在析氧反应、析氢反应、氧化还原反应、二氧化碳还原反应、超级电容器和串联电催化等过程中提供丰富的活性位点并加速电荷转移,使电催化性能更加高效。本文还讨论了SURMOF作为一类新型的薄膜催化剂在电催化应用中的研究挑战和存在的问题。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1008-9357			CSCD:6984713

Herein, bifunctional alpha-phase Co2Ni1 layered double hydroxide (LDH)-graphene oxide (GO) was prepared through bimetallic electronic regulation and GO assistance. Without GO addition, Co2Ni1 LDH bulk is dominated by the beta phase. Compared with the beta-phase type, the alpha-phase Co2Ni1 LDH-GO shows a larger interlayer spacing, which shortens the ion movement path and time and thus improves the electrochemical performance. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution in energy conversion, the ultrathin alpha-phase Co2Ni1 LDH-GO possesses the lowest overpotential eta(10) of 218.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). It also exhibits excellent stability mainly due to the Co-O bond by the cooperative electronic regulation of Ni2+. With the increase in Co-O bond length, the adsorbed OH- further oxidizes Co3+ to Co4+. As an electrode in a three-electrode supercapacitor for energy storage, the specific capacitance of Co2Ni1 LDH-GO can reach 3317.5 F g(-1). When used in an asymmetric capacitor (Co2Ni1 LDH-GO//activated carbon), Co2Ni1 LDH-GO shows a remarkable capacitance of 328.75 F g(-1) and excellent cycling stability. This work provides a phase transformation approach to improve the oxygen evolution and supercapacitor performance of multifunctional materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000859356500002

Bimetallic oxides have shown great potential for catalytic hydrogen evolution from water splitting in alkaline media because their oxygen species are beneficial for water adsorption and can get unique d electron configurations to optimize the binding strength of intermediates. Here bimetallic oxide heterointerface CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8 with rich-oxygen vacancies (V-o) incorporated by the monodisperse small-size cobalt (C-o) nanoparticles (Co@CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8-V-o) is designed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The charge redistribution occurs at the CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8 interface because of incorporation of Co, and this will be helpful for H* adsorption and interfacial electron transferring. Meanwhile, the rich-oxygen vacancies can well optimize the binding energy of intermediate species on CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8 interface and thus will facilitate the sluggish HER in alkaline media. Because of the synergistic effects of metallic Co, CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8 interfaces and richoxygen vacancies, the Co@CoMoO4/Co2Mo3O8-V-o catalyst shows superior electrocatalytic activity for HER in alkaline media with a low overpotential of 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slop of 52 mV dec(-1), and excellent durability with similar to 2% degradation after 24 h test.

Herein, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) supported N-doped porous carbon-coated NiFe alloy composite (NiFe@NC/RGO) was synthesized via a facile pyrolysis route. The introduction of RGO effectively protects the active NiFe component from agglomeration and largely promotes charge transfer. Meanwhile, the formation of porous N-doped carbon shell provides sufficient contact between active species and electrolyte, thus exposing plenty of accessible active sites. Specifically, the optimized NiFe@ NC/RGO composite shows superior electrocatalytic performance, delivering an overpotential as low as 223 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a small Tafel slope of 48.7 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution, which outperforms commercial precious metal oxide catalysts such as RuO2 and a vast majority of electrocatalysts reported so far. Long-term cycling test demonstrates that the overpotential at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has almost no change after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 50 mV s(-1), indicating its quite good stability. The low-cost and high-performance electrocatalyst developed in this work shows great potential for practical hydrogen production from electrolysis of water.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800107

Here we demonstrate the preparation of ultrathin Ni3FeAlx trinary LDH nanosheets with higher activity and stability than NiFe-LDH nanosheets for OER. The enhancement was derived from Al substitution, which increased the concentration of Ni3+ active sites on the catalyst surface. Besides, low-coordinated Ni and Fe atoms and defects were formed by partial etching/dissolution of Al3+ in alkaline solution, which further increased the activity towards OER. To improve the conductivity, Ni3FeAlx-LDH (x= 0, 0.91, 1.27 or 2.73) nanosheets were also in-situ grown on three-dimensional-networked nickel foam. The binder-free Ni3FeAlx-LDH/Ni foam electrodes exhibited further improved catalytic performance compared to the electrodes made of powdery Ni3FeAlx-LDHs and nafion binder. The best OER performance was presented by Ni3FeAl0.91-LDH/Ni foam, showing a Tafel slope of 57 mV/dec, a low overpotential (304 mV) at the current density of 20 mA/cm(2), and a current density of 235 mA/cm(2) at 1.60 V (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the Ni3FeAl0.91-LDHs/Ni foam electrode showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining a stable overpotential of 320 mV at 20 mA/cm(2) after testing for 18 h.									183	18	0	0	9	0	184			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400647900038

To address this, a bifunctional catalyst involving hierarchical NiCo2O4@Ni2P nanorods grown on nickel nanorod arrays (NiCo2O4@Ni2P/NAs) was designed and fabricated in this study for overall water splitting that provided high activity and acceptable stability. And if used as the cathode and anode in alkaline media, the NiCo2O4@Ni2P/NAs only required 1.58 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to most reported catalysts and can be attributed to a unique core-shell structure and coexisting crystalline/amorphous Ni2P phases.

Transition metal sulfides have proven to be promising electrocatalysts; however, their HER performance is still unsatisfactory. Herein, we demonstrate enhanced HER activity can be achieved in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) nanosheets coupled to TiO2 nanofibers by boron doping for the first time. The introduction of B significantly increases the sulfur vacancies, and thus, is favorable for enhancing the HER activity of ZIS@TiO2. Moreover, the well-matched band alignment between B doped ZIS and TiO2 results in promoted charge transfer at the interface, further contributing to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2452-2139			WOS:000704081700005

If the cost associated with electrolyzers was significantly reduced, it would pave a path to the efficient and economical generation of clean molecular hydrogen that could be used as a feedstock to create energy. As of now, only a handful of materials can challenge the performance of the current state-of-the-art cathodic catalyst, platnium, utilized in porous exchange-membrane electrolyzer devices. Herein, we show that 6.6 wt % of Pt on a homemade graphene film can achieve comparable hydrogen evolution activity to bulk platinum metal and surpass that of non-noble metal materials on carbon films previously reported.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000474474800073

We report that indium tin oxide (ITO) nanocrystals with supported 1-2 nm oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst Ru/RuOx nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrate efficient OER processes, reduce the recharge overpotential of the cell significantly and maintain catalytic activity to promote a consistent cycling discharge potential in LiO2 cells even when the ITO support nanocrystals deteriorate from the very first cycle. The Ru/RuOx nanoparticles lower the charge overpotential compared with those for ITO and carbononly cathodes and have the greatest effect in DMSO electrolytes with a solution-processable F-free carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) binder (< 3.5 V) instead of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF). The Ru/RuOx/ITO nanocrystalline materials in DMSO provide efficient Li2O2 decomposition from within the cathode during cycling. We demonstrate that the ITO is actually unstable from the first cycle and is modified by chemical etching, but the Ru/RuOx NPs remain effective OER catalysts for Li2O2 during cycling. The CMC binders avoid PVDF-based side-reactions and improve the cyclability. The deterioration of the ITO nanocrystals is mitigated significantly in cathodes with a CMC binder, and the cells show good cycle life. In mixed DMSO-EMITFSI [EMITFSI=1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis (trifluoro-methylsulfonyl) imide] ionic liquid electrolytes, the Ru/RuOx/ITO materials in Li-O-2 cells cycle very well and maintain a consistently very low charge overpotential of 0.5-0.8 V.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000394572100013	27899004

Simply heating an ethanol slurry of MoCl5, urea, CNT, and graphene oxide at 750 degrees C under nitrogen atmosphere uniformly distributed 8 nm Mo2C nanoparticles in the nitrogen-doped CNT-RGO support. The resultant Mo2C/CNT-RGO exhibited markedly improved electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) compared to similarly prepared Mo2C/CNT, Mo2C/RGO, and bare Mo2C. Enhanced Mo2C/CNT-RGO performance could originate from the synergy between Mo2C nanoparticles with high HER activity and N-doped CNT-RGO support providing large surface area and high electrical conductivity.

They have been widely studied for many electrochemical reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it remains a significant challenge to realize high-efficiency bifunctional catalysis (ORR/OER) with single-metal-type active sites. Herein, we report atomically dispersed Fe-Co dual metal sites (FeCo-NC) derived from Fe and Co codoped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8s), aiming to build up multiple active sites for bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts. The atomically dispersed FeCo-NC catalyst shows excellent bifunctional catalytic activity in alkaline media for the ORR (E-1/2 = 0.877 V) and the OER (E-j=10 = 1.579 V). Moreover, its outstanding stability during the ORR and the OER is comparable to noblemetal catalysts (Pt/C and RuO2). The atomic dispersion state, coordination structure, and the charge density difference of the dual metal site FeCo-NC were characterized and determined using advanced physical characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The FeCo-N-6 moieties are likely the main active sites simultaneously for the ORR and the OER with improved performance relative to the traditional single Fe and Co site catalysts. We further incorporated the FeCo-NC catalyst into an air electrode for fabricating rechargeable and flexible Zn-air batteries, generating a superior power density (372 mW cm(-2)) and long-cycle (over 190 h) stability. This work would provide a method to design and synthesize atomically dispersed multi-metal site catalysts for advanced electrocatalysis.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000753076300039

In this work, by means of spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) computations, we have systematically explored the catalytic performance of several palladium (Pd-n,n= 1-6, and 13) nanoclusters anchored on the experimentally available defective MoS(2)monolayer with S monovacancy (Pd-n/MoS2) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our results revealed that these studied Pd-n/MoS(2)materials have high stability due to the strong interaction of Pd clusters with the dangling Mo atoms and the S atoms around the vacancy with the binding energy per Pd atom ranging from -3.12 to -4.36 eV. Interestingly, the ORR/OER catalytic activity of these Pd-n/MoS(2)catalysts was greatly dependent on the sizes of the anchored Pd clusters: Pd-6/MoS(2)is predicted to exhibit the highest ORR catalytic activity due to its lowest overpotential of 0.59 V among all the studied catalysts, while Pd-2/MoS(2)is identified as the best OER catalyst due to its ultra-low overpotential of 0.32 V. Thus, our DFT results suggested that the ORR/OER catalytic performance could be effectively tuned by precisely controlling the sizes of the anchored Pd clusters on the MoS(2)monolayer, which provides an important insight to further design novel and efficient ORR/OER catalysts.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000573182000034

Herein, an integrated, S-doped MnOx/Mn film developed on carbon paper (CP) formed by a two-step transformation approach that includes template-free electrodeposition and in-situ electrochemical oxidation is employed as an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. The doping of S and in-situ electro-oxidation lead to a tailored electronic structure and phase composition, which endow the composite electrode with a significantly enhanced OER catalytic performance. This S-doped integrated electrode perfectly combines highly active MnOx outer layers with conductive metallic Mn inner layers to offer abundant catalytic interfaces and electronic paths, leading to favorable reaction kinetics. As a result, the optimal S-doped MnOx/Mn/CP offers a low overpotential of 435 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 89.97 mV dec(-1) as well as improved stability. Impressively, a highly intrinsic catalytic activity with a turnover frequency of 0.0112 s(-1) is obtained for S-doped MnOx/Mn/CP, which is 4.2-fold higher than that of MnOx/Mn/CP. S doping plays a critical role in stabilizing the (MnOx)-O-III active phase and is ultimately responsible for the enhanced catalytic performance. This work provides an integrated design concept and S doping approach suitable for boosting the OER catalytic performance of MnOx. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

From stars to nuclei								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS				156				257	263		10.1140/epjst/e2008-00623-1				APR 2008	2008	We recall the basic physical principles governing the evolution of stars with some emphasis on the role played by the nuclear reactions. We argue that in general it is not possible from observations of stars to deduce constraints on the nuclear reaction rates. This is the reason why precise measurements of nuclear reaction rates are a necessity in order to make progresses in stellar physics, nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of galaxies. There are however some stars which provides useful constraints on nuclear processes. The Wolf-Rayet stars of the WN type present at their surface CNO equilibrium patterns. There is also the particular case of the abundance of Ne-22 at the surface of WC stars. The abundance of this element is a measure of the initial CNO content. Very interestingly, recent determinations of its abundance at the surface of WC stars tend to confirm that massive stars in the solar neighborhood have initial metallicities in agreement with the Asplund et al.

The only 5 cycles of ALD led to a high dispersion of Pt nanoparticles on BCF surfaces with an average size of 2 nm, possessing an as low as 0.87 wt% of mass loading. The HER catalytic performance revealed that the as-prepared Pt/BCF have good catalytic activity and stability.

We here report the controlled synthesis of NiS2/FeS2 nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanorods (NiS2/FeS2/NC) through carbonization and sulfurization of Fe/Ni-based bimetallic metal-organic frameworks. Benefiting from both structural and compositional characteristics, the resulting NiS2/FeS2/NC nanorods possess abundant active sites, high electrical conductivity and rapid mass transfer, thereby delivering 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 172 mV and 231 mV towards the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with robust stability in 1.0 M KOH solution, respectively. When employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, it requires only 1.58 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming that of the commercial Pt/C parallel to RuO2. Additionally, lithium-ion batteries tests also show high reversible capacity (718 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and excellent cycling stability and rate performance. The work in this paper not only provides a promising strategy for designing efficient multi-functional electrode materials with similar morphology and structure, but also can be extended to the synthesis of other mixed metal sulfides for energy conversion and storage.									31	3	0	0	0	0	32			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000483408400047

The environmentally friendly preparation of Fe-N-C electrocatalysts is desirable but still challenging. Here, several Fe-N-C catalysts incorporated by ZIF-8 has been simply prepared by solid state reaction method. Fe-N-C containing 2% mole percentage Fe electrocatalysts fired at 900 degrees C exhibited superior intrinsic activities in oxygen saturated -0.1M KOH for ORR with half wave potential of 0.831 V (versus RHE), comparable with Pt/C from JM (0.838V). It also exhibited higher stability than those of Pt-C in alkaline condition. The higher intrinsic ORR activity and remarkable stability can be due to the more dispersed Fe-N-x active sites, which indicate that Fe-N-Cb-y 2% mole percentage Fe electrocatalyst is an excellent alternative electrocatalyst for energy applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2053-1591		WOS:000530854500006

In this review we focus on bio-inspired Cu-containing complexes that are classified according to the proposed mechanistic pathways and the related experimental evidence, strongly linked to the applied ligand architecture.

High-entropy alloys (HEAs) can inhibit the dissolution of metals, but it is difficult for elements with large differences in physical properties (e.g., electronegativity, atomic radius, and melting point) to be uniformly dissolved together. Herein, we prepare a homogeneous face-centered cubic FeCoNiMnMo HEA by electrolyzing the solid oxide mixture in molten salt at 900 degrees C. The concomitant solid-state electrometallization and alloying process prevent the phase segregation that usually happens in the repeated melting method. More importantly, the as-prepared FeCoNiMnMo shows a good electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotential (eta) = 279 mV, j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability for over 1000 h without significant decay. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that Mo is a crucial enabler in achieving a high electrocatalytic activity and durability. The high-entropy effect significantly reduces the leaching rate of Mo and thereby maintains the thickness of the catalytic layer. In addition, the FeCoNiMnMo HEA electrode can perform stably under industrial conditions (6 M KOH, 60 degrees C, and 400 mA cm(-2)) for more than 300 h, demonstrating the ability to serve under industrial conditions. The preparation and design of the single-phase FeCoNiMnMo HEA electrode offer infinite OER candidates for enabling efficient water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000859204600001

It is observed that the solvents play an important role in setting the surface morphology and size of the crystallites by controlling nucleation and growth rate. An optimized mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanosheet electrode shows a high specific capacitance of 1658 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) with excellent restoring capability of approximate to 99% at 2 A g(-1) and superior energy density of 132.64 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 0.72 kW kg(-1). The CuCo2O4 electrode also exhibits excellent endurance performance with capacity retention of 90% and coulombic efficiency of approximate to 99% after 5000 charge/discharge cycles. The best OER activity is obtained from the CuCo2O4 nanosheet sample with the lowest overpotential of approximate to 290 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 117 mV dec(-1). The superior bifunctional electrochemical activity of the mesoporous CuCo2O4 nanosheet is a result of electrochemically favorable 2D morphology, which leads to the formation of a very large electrochemically active surface area.									94	1	0	0	6	0	94			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000438368300005	29882393

Even highly active catalysts such as the nanoparticulated transition metal oxides IrO2, RuO2 and their mixtures, IrxRu1-xO2 exhibit overpotentials up to several hundreds of millivolts. The surface of the oxide mixtures IrxRu1-xO2 is found to consist of actives sites of both Ir and Ru on which the OER mechanism is processed independently and at different overpotentials. By applying microkinetic modelling and parameterization via cyclic voltammograms we show that there is a correlation between performance and the relative Ir content, that can be explained by two different deprotonation steps. These are in particular the formation of the adsorbate species *OOH on rutile RuO2 and *OO on IrO2. The respective free reaction energies are quantified to 1.44 eV and 1.58 eV, which are the highest values of the process and thus determining the overpotential. The additional finding of adsorbed oxygen *O covering 40% of the active sites during the OER suggests that subsequent water adsorption is the major performance limiting step. Finally, a synergetic effect between both active sites on the binary transition metal oxides is identified: the respective other metal lowers the potential determining reaction energy on the Ru or Ir active site. This insight into the surface processes on Ir and Ru binary oxides forms the basis for deeper understanding of the active sites for further OER catalyst development.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000861543900001

Water oxidation occurs at a relatively low overpotential for copper of 520-580 mV with a turnover frequency of similar to 0.7 s(-1). Controlled potential electrolysis experiments over 12 h at 1.1 V vs NHE resulted in the formation of >30 catalytic turnovers of O-2 with only similar to 20% catalyst degradation. The robustness of the catalyst under fairly harsh conditions and the low overpotential further highlight the oxidation resistance and strong donor character of pyalk.									113	2	0	0	9	0	113			2155-5435			WOS:000401054300036

It has been well confirmed that surface modification is inevitable in such a process, with the formation of different re-constructed oxide layers. However, which oxide species should be responsible for the optimized catalytic efficiencies and the detailed interface structure between the modified layer and precatalyst remain controversial. Here, a topological CoS2 single crystal with a well-defined exposed surface is used as a model catalyst, which makes the direct investigation of the interface structure possible. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy of the sample reveals the formation of a 2 nm thickness Co3O4 layer that grows epitaxially on the CoS2 surface. Thick CoO pieces are also observed and are loosely attached to the bulk crystal. The compact Co3O4 interface structure can result in the fast electron transfer from adsorbed O species to the bulk crystal compared with CoO pieces as evidenced by the electrochemical impedance measurements. This leads to the competitive apparent and intrinsic reactivity of the crystal despite the low surface geometric area. These findings are helpful for the understanding of catalytic origins of transition metal chalcogenides and the designing of highperformance catalysts with interface-phase engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813067500001	35468289

However, it still remains a great challenge to construct MoP electrocatalysts with abundant active sites that possess ideal H binding strength to promote catalytic performance. In this work, it is found that by anchoring a rare earth compound, cerium phosphate (CePO4) on MoP (CePO4/MoP), the stabilized Ce3+ in CePO4 can significantly boost the formation of oxygen vacancies in ceria (CeO2) in situ formed on CePO4 surface during HER, which effectively regulates the d-band electronic density-of-states of MoP, increases the numbers of active sites, and promotes the vectorial electron transfer, therefore greatly enhancing the HER performance of MoP. The optimized CePO4/MoP/carbon cloth (CC) electrocatalyst exhibits a significantly improved HER performance with an overpotential of 48 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), about two times better than the HER performance of MoP catalyst without CePO4 (with an overpotential >80 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)), very close to commercial Pt/C catalyst.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000693457800001	34494360

Biological slices confirm that Ru ions can penetrate the cell walls of saccharomycete, which facilitates the adsorption of Ru ions. Herein, based on a green synthesis process by saccharomycete cells as the carbon template and nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) sources, novel Janus-like ruthenium-ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles embedded into a N/P dual-doped carbon matrix (Ru-Ru2PPhiNPC) electrocatalyst for HER are synthesized. Electrochemical tests reveal that Ru-Ru2PPhiNPC displays remarkable performance with a low overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and demonstrates superior stability at a high current density in 0.5 m H2SO4. Furthermore, ruthenium oxide nanoparticles coated N/P dual-doped carbon (NPC@RuO2) are also synthesized with a yolk-shell structure using saccharomycete cells as the core template and RuO2 as a shell to isolate saccharomycete cells from the oxidation reaction during calcination in air. The NPC@RuO2 as oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst possesses a low overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm-2. Finally, the Ru-Ru2PPhiNPC is integrated as a cathode and NPC@RuO2 is integrated as an anode to construct a two-electrode electrolyzer to enable an excellent performance for overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.50 V at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 m H2SO4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X			INSPEC:19558492

It is well known that the addition of Fe can dramatically enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of Co-based materials; however, the role of Ni doping in Co-based materials for the OER is not well understood, though a similar enhancement was anticipated. In the present study, hexagonal Co(OH)(2) nanosheets were synthesized with various concentrations of Ni-doping. Detailed structural and electrochemical characterization revealed that Ni0.25Co0.75(OH)(2) shows the best OER performance, with an enhanced overpotential of 40 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) compared to Co(OH)(2). Theoretical calculations, experimental characterization and electrochemical analysis together demonstrate that the introduction of Ni could reduce the band gap, and decrease the numbers of valence electrons and active O-H and Co-O-H groups of the host Co(OH)(2), thus improving the conductivity, charge transfer, and catalytic kinetics, consequently enhancing the OER performance.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200025

In this context, by pyrolyzing a nontoxic and low-cost iron-coordinated polydopamine polymer (Fe-PDA-30, 30 represents the polymerization time) precursor at 800 degrees C, a template-free oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst iron and nitrogen co-doped hierarchical porous graphitic carbon (Fe, N/PGC-30) was obtained. The obtained catalyst Fe, N/PGC-30, first reported here, manifests outstanding oxygen reduction activity in a wide range of pH. It is worth nothing that the catalyst exhibits remarkable ORR activity with a more positive half-wave potential of 15 mV than that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst under alkaline conditions. Additionally, the activity of the catalyst is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C under neutral and acidic conditions with almost a 4e(-) reaction process and very low H2O2 yield. This catalyst provides an exciting direction for non-precious metal electrocatalysts with excellent oxygen reduction activity in a wide range of pH. These favorable results demonstrate that the catalyst Fe, N/PGC-30 can serve as a highly efficient and stable ORR catalyst for practical fuel cell applications.									43	1	0	0	1	0	44			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384444200034

Based on the results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it was confirmed that the initial oxide layer on the boron particles surface was removed by the wet milling process, and that a new B-O-Ti bond was formed on the boron surface. The uniform TiO2 layer on the 150 nm boron particles was estimated to be 10 nm thick. Based on linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, current-time amperometry, and electrochemical impedance analyses, the potential for the application of TiO2-coated boron particles as a photoelectrochemical catalyst was demonstrated. A current of 250 mu A was obtained at a potential of 0.5 V for hydrogen evolution, with an onset potential near to 0.0 V.

However, it is still challenging to clarify the interactions between the Ru catalysts and the layered transition metal hydroxides in different phases and also to unveil the mechanism responsible for the boosted performance. Herein, we report novel Ru nanocluster-decorated few-layer Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, which are employed as a model to investigate the structure-property relationship between zero-dimensional (0D) noble metal catalysts and two-dimensional (2D) substrates toward electrochemical reactions. The obtained alpha-Co(OH)(2)-Ru catalyst exhibits a very low potential difference (Delta E) of 0.557 V between the half-wave potential towards the ORR and the potential at 10 mA cm(-2) towards the OER, which is smaller than those of beta-Co(OH)(2)-Ru (0.614 V), alpha-Co(OH)(2) (0.774 V) and beta-Co(OH)(2) (0.897 V). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step of alpha-Co(OH)(2)-Ru is much smaller than those of beta-Co(OH)(2)-Ru and Ru, implying that the strong electronic interactions between Ru nanoclusters and layered alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets contribute majorly to the enhanced catalytic performance. Furthermore, the optimized alpha-Co(OH)(2)-Ru nanohybrid is employed as the air electrode to assemble rechargeable Zn-air batteries, which possesses a power density of 187.8 mW cm(-2) and a long-term durability of 400 cycles without obvious attenuation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000857170900001

In this study, we design a unique preparation process to form a carbon-coated Co/Co9S8-MoS2 bifunctional catalyst. Excessive H2S generated in the decomposition process of ammonium thiomolybdate can partially sulfurize carbon-coated Co nanoparticles, and Co/Co9S8 mixed phases will be formed on MoS2. The as-prepared catalyst possesses good bifunctional electrocatalytic activity under the alkaline environment for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The amorphous carbon-coated Co/Co9S8-MoS2 composite shows a low overpotential of 128 mV for HER and 325 mV for OER in 1 M KOH solution, respectively. Besides, the amorphous carbon shell can prevent Co/Co9S8 nanoparticles from corrosion, and the catalyst shows remarkable long-term cycle stability.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0888-5885			WOS:000505632500040

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are typical operating modes of surface exchange process. To enhance ORR/OER properties, nanostructures are introduced into surface porous layer/electrode for such devices. Due to high operating temperatures, the synthesis routes for low temperature nanostructured devices are rarely suitable, and infiltration could be the only widely used technique to fabricate nanostructured surfaces. Recently, hydrothermal synthesis route is attempted to fabricate nanostructured surface for oxygen permeation membrane. Nevertheless, neither ORR/OER properties nor stability of such a nanostructured surface is studied at high temperature operating conditions. In this research, Co3O4 nanocluster-structured surfaces are directly fabricated using hydrothermal route on GDC-LSCF membrane and GDC electrolyte-supported symmetric cells. Electrochemical kinetic properties of Co3O4 nanocluster modified surfaces are systematically measured using symmetric cells with two-electrode and three-electrode configurations. ORR/OER surface exchange mechanisms are analyzed, and the effects of nanostructured surface are identified. The effect of Co(3)O(4 )nanocluster-structured surfaces on GDC-LSCF membrane performance is systematically studied. A short-term stability test (similar to 100 h) is also conducted at 900 degrees C using the symmetric cell. Polarization performance of symmetric cell degrades during the initial stage of stability test due to surface nanocluster agglomeration but is stabilized beyond similar to 80 h because of surface nanostructure stabilization.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000829726200001

For each additive the protective cation was incorporated into the oxide film that formed on the metal surface during exposure to the solution tested. The cations added (Cd2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+ and Ni2+) caused a surface film to be developed that modified the susceptibility to corrosion by reducing the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at cathodic sites on the tin surface. It was found that a concentration of 10(-2) M of these ions inhibits the anodic Sn dissolution reaction by a factor of 2-3. The presence of the metal ions, more electronegative than the cathodic potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction on tin in the solution tested, inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction and corrosion of Sn. This effect was explained by the underpotential deposition of adatoms of the metal complexing ions on the Sn electrode.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0254-0584			WOS:A1995RN75400003

In this work, delafossite CuGaO2 (CGO) crystal was synthesized through hydrothermal routes with Cu(NO3)(2)center dot 3H(2)O and Ga(NO3)(3)center dot xH(2)O used as reactants. The addition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was found to play an important role in modifying the morphology of CuGaO2 (CGO-CTAB). With the addition of CTAB, the morphology of CGO-CTAB samples changed from irregular flake to typical hexagonal sheet microstructure, with an average size of 1-2 mu m and a thickness of around 100 nm. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic activity of CGO-CTAB crystals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was also studied and compared with that of CGO crystals. CGO-CTAB samples exhibited better activity than CGO. An overpotential of 391.5 mV was shown to be able to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The as-prepared samples also demonstrate good stability for water oxidation and relatively fast OER kinetics with a Tafel slope of 56.4 mV/dec. This work highlights the significant role of modification of CTAB surfactants in preparing CGO related crystals, and the introduction of CTAB was found to help to improve their electrocatalytic activity for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-2759	2095-2767		WOS:000782181700001

The electrodeposits of Cu-Zn alloy were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), cronoamperometry (CA), linear voltammetry (LV), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The formation of the CuZn5 intermetallic compound was associated with the underpotential deposition of zinc and its intercalation into the lattice of copper. Analysis of the chronoamperograms obtained was used for understanding of nucleation and growth mechanism during the formation of these intermetallic compounds.

Two key requirements to achieve highly efficient and stable Si photoelectrodes are electronic passivation to reduce recombination losses at the Si/catalyst interface, and chemical protection of Si from corrosion in the alkaline electrolyte. In this work, Si photocathodes are fabricated by employing a carrier selective passivation layer consisting of an ultrathin SiOx (similar to 1.4 nm) capped with n(+) polycrystalline Si (similar to 70 nm), and a compact NiMo/Ni bilayer catalyst. The Si photocathodes integrated with Earth abundant catalyst and state-of-art charge selective passivation layer achieve an applied bias to photon conversion efficiency of 10.5%, and high stability above 60 hours. Importantly, the NiMo/Ni catalyst is developed using the industry-relevant sputter deposition method presenting vertically aligned, rod-like nanostructures with a low overpotential of 89 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Finally, a remarkable overall unassisted water splitting efficiency of 17% is achieved for an all-low-cost materials-based system, by combining the Si photocathode with a high bandgap perovskite PV top cell in tandem configuration, and a high-performance NiFe electrode for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000728259000001

To address this issue, herein, we present a facile and scalable spray drying and subsequent phosphorization approach to synthesize iron-cobalt bimetallic nanoflakes encapsulated in N-doped graphene (FCP@NG). The optimized FCP@NG exhibits excellent performance in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting. It demonstrates remarkable performance in the HER and superior activity in the OER, even outperforming the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. Being employed as both the cathode and anode on nickel foams, this FCP@NG hybrid demonstrates promising performance in overall water splitting with a very low potential of 1.63 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior among most of the recently reported transition-metal-based catalysts and comparable to the commercial Pt/RuO2 cell. The outstanding electrocatalytic performance of FCP@NG is attributed to a synergistic effect of its bi-metallization, unique nanoflake structure and conductive N-doped graphene encapsulation. This work provides a scalable and low-cost strategy to synthesize nonprecious and bi-functional transition-metal-based catalysts with unique nanoarchitecture and outstanding catalytic performance for overall water splitting.									44	6	0	0	5	0	45			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000475482200007	31214672

Herein, Mo-doped Ni0.85Se on the Ni foam (denoted as NF@Mo-Ni0.85Se) was prepared as effective bifunctional catalyst to boost H2 production and translate 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2, 5-furfuran carboxylic acid (FDCA) simultaneously. Operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and theoretical calculations confirm that the Mo doping could speed the electron transmission within the catalyst and downshift the d-band center of Ni in NF@Ni0.85Se, which is not only conducive to abating H* adsorption energy, but further promotes the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and organic hydrogen adsorption process. The as-synthesized electrocatalysts have shown outstanding hydrogen evolution property in acid, neutral, alkaline and seawater. When the NF@MoNi0.85Se||NF@Mo-Ni0.85Se catalyst couple was employed for HER as well as HMF oxidation in basic electrolytes, the potential only required a potential of 1.50 V to obtain the current density of 50 mA cm-2, lower than that of overall water splitting (1.68 V). This present work especially emphasizes the significance of doping transition metals to improve material properties for constructing bifunctional electrocatalysts towards highly efficient energy utilization.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672571000002

As potential electrocatalysts, the improvement of water splitting catalyzed by transition metal phosphides remains a great challenge. Modulating the electronic state through atomic interactions is highly effective in stimulating the intrinsic activity. Here, a simple and controllable pulse-electrodeposition method is used to prepare iron and nickel co-doped cobalt phosphide (CoP) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting in alkaline medium. Doping with iron and nickel significantly modulates the electronic state of CoP, thus resulting in enhanced activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction with a low overpotential of 33 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Furthermore, the in situ generated (Ni,Fe)(x)Co1-x oxyhydroxides/hydroxides on the surface of CoFeNiP/NF during the oxygen evolution reaction facilitate high OER activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Notably, doping with iron and nickel effectively suppresses the cobalt deterioration during the anodic oxidation process, which ensures a negligible deactivation after twenty-hour bulk electrolysis continuously operating at a constant current density.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000653213200001

ZIF-67 is synthesized and used as a template for the synthesis of the composite. The composite is designed by using the effective photocatalytic properties of Co3O4 and TiO2. The resulting synthesized composite is supposed to offer superior properties compared to their counterparts. The synthesized Co3O4@TiO2 composite is characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical water splitting, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) studies on the Co3O4@TiO2 composite, is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis in a 2M aqueous KOH electrolyte. The current generation stability of these samples is deliberated by chronoamperometric measurements. It is observed, from LSV results at a 1 mV/s scan rate, that metal oxides incorporated on other metal oxides have a higher current density and lower onset potential as compared to pure metal oxides. From the obtained results, it has become evident that synthesized studies on the Co3O4@TiO2 composite possess significant potential for electrochemical water splitting with the lowest onset potential, highest current density, better OER, and HER activity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2075-4701		WOS:000633870000001

Such oxides have found utility as stable frameworks to support metals that are active for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis, but they also possess two-electron redox couples, which can potentially engender OER activity. Thus, the use of p-block oxide supports provides an imperative for understanding the OER activity of the unary oxides. Toward this end, we report BiOx films that are able to perform OER catalysis at moderate overpotentials for extended periods of operations (>110 h) in highly acidic solutions (pH 1.0-2.25) with no sign of decreased OER activity during operations at current densities of 1-5 mA cm(-2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry reveal a change in the Bi oxidation state prior to OER catalysis, from predominantly Bi3+ in the as-deposited films to primarily Bi5+ in the catalytically active films. This transformation is accompanied by a prominent color change from orange to dark brown. Simulations of the cyclic voltammogram catalytic profiles suggest two OER pathways for BiOx involving (BiOx)-O-IV and (BiOx)-O-V catalysts, with the (BiOx)-O-V pathway prevailing after catalyst activation. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of BiOx to facilitate OER in acid with high functional stability and underscore the noninnocent role that p-block metal oxides may play in OER catalysis in acidic media.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000740446200001		
J	Exner, Kai S.; Over, Herbert					Over, Herbert/0000-0001-7689-7385			Kinetics of Electrocatalytic Reactions from First-Principles: A Critical Comparison with the Ab Initio Thermodynamics Approach								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				50	5			1240	1247		10.1021/acs.accounts.7b00077				MAY 2017	2017	Multielectron processes in electrochemistry require the stabilization of reaction intermediates (RI) at the electrode surface after every elementary reaction step. Accordingly, the bond strengths of these intermediates are important for assessing the catalytic performance of an electrode material. Current understanding of microscopic processes in modern electrocatalysis research is largely driven by theory, mostly based on ab initio thermodynamics considerations, where stable reaction intermediates at the electrode surface are identified, while the actual free energy barriers (or activation barriers) are ignored. This simple approach is popular in electrochemistry in that the researcher has a simple tool at hand in successfully searching for promising electrode materials. The ab initio TD approach allows for a rough but fast screening of the parameter space with low computational cost. However, ab initio thermodynamics is also frequently employed (often, even based on a single binding energy only) to comprehend on the activity and on the mechanism of an electrochemical reaction. The basic idea is that the activation barrier of an endergonic reaction step consists of a thermodynamic part and an additional kinetically determined barrier. Assuming that the activation barrier scales with thermodynamics (so-called Bronsted Polanyi Evans (BEP) relation) and the kinetic part of the barrier is small, ab initio thermodynamics may provide molecular insights into the electrochemical reaction kinetics. However, for many electrocatalytic reactions, these tacit assumptions are violated so that ab initio thermodynamics will lead to contradictions with both experimental data and ab initio kinetics.In this Account, we will discuss several electrochemical key reactions, including chlorine evolution (CER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction (ORR), where ab initio kinetics data are available in order to critically compare the results with those derived from a simple ab initio thermodynamics treatment. We show that ab initio thermodynamics leads to erroneous conclusions about kinetic and mechanistic aspects for the CER over RuO2(110), while the kinetics of the OER over RuO2(110) and ORR over Pt(111) are reasonably well described. Microkinetics of an electrocatalyzed reaction is largely simplified by the quasi-equilibria of the RI preceding the rate-determining step (rds) with the reactants. Therefore, in ab initio kinetics the rate of an electrocatalyzed reaction is governed by the transition state (TS) with the highest free energy G(rds)(#), defining also the rate-determining step (rds). Ab initio thermodynamics may be even more powerful, when using the highest free energy of an reaction intermediate G(max) (RI) rather than the highest free energy difference between consecutive reaction intermediates, Delta G(loss), as a descriptor for the kinetics.									93	2	0	0	7	0	94			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000401674600013	28463492

Herein, a facile surface reconstruction strategy of microwave radiation oxidation is reported to fabricate cobalt phosphide (CoP) multishelled hollow spheres with an amorphous cobalt oxide (CoOx) species coating layer (denoted as CoP@CoOx). The synergistic effect between multishelled hollow-structured CoP and amorphous CoOx can trigger strong electronic modulation on the heterointerface, leading to the increased electrochemical active surface area, the improved charge transfer, and the modification of the electronic structure. As a result, the significant improvements in the catalytic activity, long-term stability, and efficiency are achieved compared with pristine CoP. Especially, the CoP@CoOx composite by microwave radiation oxidation for 6 min on nickel foam (NF) displays significantly enhanced HER activity with a low overpotential of 35 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and, even more remarkably, of 109 mV at ultrahigh current density of 100 mA cm( -2). The concept of interfacial electronic modulation by surface reconstruction can offer a unique approach for the rational design of hydrogen evolution catalysts and beyond.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700037

Herein, the electrodeposited amorphous NiFe hydroxide species for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting reaction is demonstrated by revealing the synergistic effect influenced by the support electrode of Fe and Ni foil and the contents of Fe and Ni in the electrolyte. All the electrodeposited samples have an amorphous structure and similar profiles of binding energy and chemical states for Fe and Ni as characterized by the spectroscopic techniques. While the support effect and Fe/Ni synergistic effect are indeed observed for the varied catalytic performances observed for the different electrodes; the Ni foil supported catalyst exhibits much higher performance than that of the Fe foil supported catalyst, and the different redox potentials of Ni species in the different Fe/Ni electrode resulting from the Fe-Ni synergism are observed in the cyclic voltammetry curve analysis. The surface roughness and the electrochemical surface area are also influenced by the support effect and the Fe/Ni ratio in the plating electrolyte. The optimal electrode shows a very low overpotential of similar to 200 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and very high catalytic stability by the consecutive cyclic voltammetry measurements and 20 h stability test. Though it has the largest electrochemical surface area, the highest catalytic efficiency for these active sites is also indicated by the specific activity and turnover frequency polarization curves. The current work shows the effective experience for the electrodeposited Fe/Ni based catalysts in large-scale fabrication, which can be more practical for hydrogen generation in the alkaline water electrolysis.

It is critical to develop low-cost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with excellent catalytic activity and stability. In this paper, the electrocatalyst Co/WC@NC, Co and WC nanoparticles coated by N-doped carbon layers, was synthesized via one-step calcination process. Co/WC@NC reveals efficient electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance with the overpotentials of 158 mV and 178 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, corresponding Tafel slopes of 88 and 98 mV dec(-1). Otherwise, Co/WC@NC appears stability for 24 h in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The satisfactory HER performance of Co/WC@NC is principally due to synergy between the multiple components. As well as, the graphitic carbon layers will protect the electrocatalyst from corrosion in acidic and alkaline solutions, thus enhancing the stability. This study provides an experimental basis to devise and preparation of efficient and durability electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000760630400001		
J	Schwager, Patrick; Fenske, Daniela; Wittstock, Gunther				Wittstock, Gunther/H-1367-2011	Wittstock, Gunther/0000-0002-6884-5515			Scanning electrochemical microscopy of oxygen permeation through air-electrodes in lithium-air batteries								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				740				82	87		10.1016/j.jelechem.2014.12.040				MAR 1 2015	2015	Non-aqueous Li-air-batteries can provide potentially a very high energy density. The reaction at the positive electrode is the oxygen reduction reaction. Its products are lithium oxides (mainly Li2O2) that deposit as solid compound in the porous gas diffusion electrode (GDE). This can cause passivation of the electrode surface or clogging of gas diffusion pathway though the porous material. Here a new method is reported to measure in-situ the oxygen permeation though a GDE during the discharge process. It is based on the concepts of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in which a positionable microelectrode (ME) is used to detect the influx of oxygen in an deaerated electrolyte close to the outer surface of the GDE. However, no steady-state current for oxygen reduction at the ME can be obtained in Li-containing electrolytes because solid lithium oxides also deposit on the ME. Therefore, a pulsed potential program was developed that periodically removes deposits from the surface of the ME and eliminates the effect of surface passivation of the probe electrode. We validated this method by monitoring the oxygen reduction current at the ME as a result of oxygen permeating GDEs of different thickness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Copper-cobalt bimetallic composites exhibit excellent electrochemical performance but the agglomeration of nanoparticles and phase separation cannot be avoided in high temperature pyrolysis. Herein, Cu(ii) ions are introduced into Co-based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) by a polymer-coating method to synthesize copper-cobalt bimetallic composite phosphides (CuCoP). After further pyrolysis and phosphidation, the uniform CuCoP nanoparticles are embedded into N-doped carbon frameworks (CuCoP-NC) derived from organic ligands. CuCoP-NC possesses unique hollow structure, rich pores in the carbon framework and large specific surface areas. At an optimal carbonization temperature of 700 degrees C, CuCoP-NC-700 exhibits admirable electrocatalytic performance such as high onset potentials (0.978 V vs. reversible hydrogen potential (RHE) in alkaline media and 0.801 V vs. RHE in acidic media), large limiting current densities, long-term stability and eximious resistance to methanol poisoning towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic media and a low overpotential of 337 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, CuCoP-NC-700 is assembled into a Zn-air battery and presents a higher power density (116.5 mW cm(-2)) and stability compared to Pt/C.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000487944000023	31524914

Depending on the water content, metal ions in the isostructural Co2+ and Ni2+ derivatives are octahedrally coordinated (n = 3) or consist of octahedral together with dimeric trigonal bipyramidal (n = 1) or square pyramidal (n = 0) environments. The imidazole molecule acts as a ligand (Co2+, Ni2+ derivatives) or charge-compensating protonated species (Zn2+ derivative). For the latter, the proton conductivity is determined to be similar to 6 x 10(-4) S.cm(-1) at 80 degrees C and 95% relative humidity (RH). By pyrolyzing in 5%H-2-Ar at 700-850 degrees C, core-shell electrocatalysts consisting of Co2+-, Ni2+-phosphides or Co2+/Ni2+-phosphide solid solution particles embedded in a N-doped carbon graphitic matrix are obtained, which exhibit improved catalytic performances compared to the non-N-doped carbon materials. Co2+ phosphides consist of CoP and Co2P in variable proportions according to the used precursor and pyrolytic conditions. However, the Ni2+ phosphide is composed of Ni2P exclusively at high temperatures. Exploration of the electrochemical activity of these metal phosphides toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals that the anhydrous Co-2(ETID)(Im)(3) pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C (CoP/Co2P = 80/20 wt %) is the most active trifunctional electrocatalyst, with good integrated capabilities as an anode for overall water splitting (cell voltage of 1.61 V) and potential application in Zn-air batteries. This solid also displays a moderate activity for the HER with an overpotential of 156 mV and a Tafel slope of 79.7 mV.dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Ni2+- and Co2+/Ni2+-phosphide solid solutions show lower electrochemical performances, which are correlated with the formation of less active crystalline phases.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000787543300020	35192337

As a consequence, it is of great significance to explore low-cost, efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to promote electrocatalytic splitting water. Herein, for the first time, FeNi3-modified Fe2O3/NiO/MoO2 heterogeneous nanoparticles immobilized on N, P co-doped CNT matrix materials (FNM/NPCNT) are synthesized via a facile solid-phase grinding of the precursor, composed of nickel hexacyanoferrate/phosphomolybdic acid/CNT, and subsequently pyrolyzing under nitrogen atmosphere without any further post-processing. Due to its significant enhancement of the charge transfer efficiency and prevention of the metallic-based catalysts from being corroded, the as-prepared FNM/NPCNT hybrid electrocatalyst shows a high OER activity with a low overpotential of 282 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 46.2 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the as-prepared FNM/NPCNT hybrid delivers a large mass activity of 327.6 A g(-1) at the potential of 1.7 V and excellent stability (more than 20 h). This study opens up a new approach to design and synthesize non-precious transition metal-based composites immobilized N, P co-doped CNT materials as OER catalysts with high efficiency and long-term stability for promoting water splitting.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000515391000020	31994573

In this work, Se-NiSe 2 hybrid nanosheets with a self-regulated ratio of ionic Se (I-Se) to elemental Se (E-Se) are designed on carbon cloth by solution synthesis and hydrothermal processing. The effects of the I-Se/E-Se ratios on the electrocatalytic characteristics in HER and OER are investigated systematically both experimentally and theoretically. The optimized bifunctional electrocatalyst needs overpotentials of only 133 mV to deliver an HER current density of 10 mA cm -2 and 350 mV to generate an OER current density of 100 mA cm -2 in 1.0 mol L -1 KOH. Based on the density-functional theory calculation, surface-adsorbed E-Se is beneficial to optimizing the electron environment and the adsorption/desorption free energy of hydrogen/water of the hybrid catalyst, consequently facilitating the electrocatalytic water splitting process. There is a proper I-Se/E-Se ratio to improve the catalytic activity and kinetics of the reaction and the optimized E-Se adsorption amount can balance the interactions between I-Se and E-Se, so that the catalyst can achieve appropriate Se-H binding and active site exposure for the excellent electrocatalytic activity. To demonstrate the practicality, the assembled symmetrical device can be powered by an AA battery to produce hydrogen and oxygen synchronously. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism of transition metal selenides in water splitting and insights into the design of high-efficiency and low-cost electrocatalysts in energy-related applications.

Proton Coupled Electron Transfer and Redox-Active Tyrosine Z in the Photosynthetic Oxygen-Evolving Complex								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				133	29			11084	11087		10.1021/ja2041139				JUL 27 2011	2011	Proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions play an essential role in many enzymatic processes. In PCET, redox-active tyrosines may be involved as intermediates when the oxidized phenolic side chain deprotonates. Photosystem II (PSII) is an excellent framework for studying PCET reactions, because it contains two redox-active tyrosines, YD and YZ, with different roles in catalysis. One of the redox-active tyrosines, YZ, is essential for oxygen evolution and is rapidly reduced by the manganese-catalytic site. In this report, we investigate the mechanism of YZ PCET in oxygen-evolving PSII. To isolate YZ(center dot) reactions, but retain the manganese calcium cluster, low temperatures were used to block the oxidation of the metal cluster, high microwave powers were used to saturate the YD. EPR signal, and YZ(center dot) decay kinetics were measured with EPR spectroscopy. Analysis of the pH and solvent isotope dependence was performed. The rate of YZ(center dot) decay exhibited a significant solvent isotope effect, and the rate of recombination and the solvent isotope effect were pH independent from pH 5.0 to 7.5. These results are consistent with a rate-limiting, coupled proton electron transfer (CPET) reaction and are contrasted to results obtained for YID. decay kinetics at low pH. This effect may be mediated by an extensive hydrogen-bond network around YZ. These experiments imply that PCET reactions distinguish the two PSII redox-active tyrosines.									36	0	0	0	9	0	36			0002-7863			WOS:000293367300021	21714528

In this study, highly efficient, binder-free, Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (NiCo-LDH) nanowires on a nickel foam (NF) substrate were fabricatedviaa simple, one-step hydrothermal synthesis procedure, and their use as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) was studied. When NiCo-LDH was used as the OER electrocatalyst, the overpotential required to deliver a current density of 20 and 100 mA cm(-2), was only 270 and 410 mV (without iR correction), and it exhibited a long-term stability of 50 h in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the as-prepared NiCo-LDH nanowire electrocatalyst presented remarkable electrochemical performance for the MOR with a higher current density of 761 mA cm(-2)at 0.7 Vvs.the saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and excellent stability in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M methanol. The vertically aligned NiCo-LDH nanowires presented numerous active sites and open structures and their synergism with the highly conductive NF substrate was responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance of the electrocatalyst.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			2398-4902			WOS:000573449300032

Especially, compared with anion vacancies, cation vacancies are more challenging to generate, and studies on the structure-activity relationship of ion vacancy-rich metal oxide catalysts are still lacking. Herein, by means of abundant dangling unsaturated O and Ru vacancies, we report atomically dispersed MoRu pairs (rGO-MoO3-x-MoRu) stabilized with well-coupled graphene and MoO3-x. The atomically dispersed state of MoRu sites is confirmed by both high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements. As a result, rGO-MoO3-x-MoRu pairs show outstanding HER performance with very low overpotentials of 20 and 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) under alkaline and acidic conditions, and maintain steady hydrogen bubble evolution continuously for 35 h. Meanwhile, for HER activity, they exhibit a positive correlation with the amount of oxygen vacancies, resulting in a favorable change in the adsorption behavior of H atoms on their neighboring Mo or Ru atoms.									32	0	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700008

Nevertheless, the catalytic role of iron carbide, a component of nearly every pyrolytic Fe-N-C material, is at the focus of a heated controversy. We now resolve the debate by examining a broad range of Fe3C sites, spanning across many typical size distributions and carbon environments. Removing Fe3C selectively by a non-oxidizing acid reveals its inactivity towards two representative reactions in alkaline media, oxygen reduction and hydrazine oxidation. The activity is assigned to other pre-existing sites, most probably Fe-N-x. DFT calculations prove that the Fe3C surface binds O and N intermediates too strongly to be catalytic. By settling the argument on the catalytic role of Fe3C in alkaline electrocatalysis, we hope to spur innovation in this critical field.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000709038600001	34668906

The ignition points determine the properties of a thermonuclear explosion of a Type La supernova. We examine the cases of different accretion rates of helium and different initial masses of the white dwarf, which was studied in detail by Nomoto[4]. We find that for all cases from slow to intermediate accretion rates, nuclear burnings are ignited at the helium layers. As a consequence, carbon deflagration would be triggered for the lower accretion rate compared to that of dM/dt similar or equal to 4 x 10(-8) M-circle dot yr(-1) which has been believed to the lower limit of the accretion rate for the deflagration supernova. Furthermore, off-center helium detonation should result for intermediate and slow accretion rates and the region of carbon deflagration for slow accretion rate is disappeared.					10th International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolution of Galaxies (OMEG10)10th International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolution of Galaxies (OMEG10)	MAR 08-10, 2010MAR 08-10, 2010	RIKEN Nishina Ctr; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study; Natl Astron Observ Japan, Div Theoret Astrophys; High Energy Accelerator Res Org; Japan Atom Energy Agcy; Konan UnivRIKEN Nishina Ctr; Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study; Natl Astron Observ Japan, Div Theoret Astrophys; High Energy Accelerator Res Org; Japan Atom Energy Agcy; Konan Univ	Osaka Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys, Osaka, JAPANOsaka Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys, Osaka, JAPAN	1	0	0		0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0819-7	WOS:000281986900074

The method combines post-processing nucleosynthesis and mixing calculations with a Monte Carlo scheme. With this approach we reanalyse the dependence of theoretical oxygen isotopic ratio predictions in first dredge-up red giant branch stars in a systematic way. Such predictions are important to the interpretation of pre-solar Al2O3 grains from meteorites. The reaction rates with uncertainties were taken from the NACRE compilation of Angulo et al. We include seven reaction rates in our systematic analysis of stellar models with initial masses from 1 to 3 M.. We find that the uncertainty of the O-18(p, alpha)N-15 reaction rate typically causes an error in the theoretical O-16/O-18 ratio of similar or equal to+20/- 5 per cent. The error of the O-16/O-17 prediction is 10-40 per cent depending on the stellar mass, and is persistently dominated by the comparatively small uncertainty of the O-16(p, gamma)F-17 reaction. With the new estimates on reaction rate uncertainties by the NACRE compilation, the p-capture reactions O-17(p, alpha)N-14 and O-17(p, gamma)(18) F have virtually no impact on theoretical predictions for stellar mass less than or equal to1.5 M-.. However, the uncertainty in O-17(p, alpha)N-14 has an effect comparable to or greater than that of O-16(p, gamma)F-17 for masses >1.5 M., where core mixing and subsequent envelope mixing interact. In these cases where core mixing complicates post-dredge-up surface abundances, uncertainty in other reactions have a secondary but noticeable effect on surface abundances.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000182039700013

Here, a high performance catalyst which can facilitate both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was developed by anchoring a NiCo2O4 nanowire array on a carbon nanotube sponge (NCS). The three-dimensional morphology of NCS ensured efficient transport of the reactants and products on the catalyst surface, thereby improving the activity of the material. The prepared catalyst showed remarkable OER activity, requiring an overpotential of 280 mV, which is comparable to that of noble-metal catalysts. In addition to the noteworthy OER performance, the catalyst performed well with respect to the ORR. The total oxygen electrode activity overpotential of the catalyst was found to be 0.83 V, which is lower than that of commercial electrodes such as Pt/C and RuO2. A rechargeable Zn-air battery constructed with NCS had an open circuit voltage of 1.42 V, a maximum power density of 160 mW cm(-2), and an energy density of 706 W h kg(-1). NCS exhibited bifunctional electrocatalytic activity and high stability for both the OER and ORR, proving to be a good replacement for noble metal electrodes in rechargeable metal-air batteries.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			2516-0230			WOS:000479061800040	36133614

Morgan, Dane/0000-0002-4911-0046			Catalytic activity of (001)-AO and BO2 surfaces of transition metal perovskites: case of LaCrO3								ECS Transactions				58	33			1	8		10.1149/05833.0001ecst				2014	2014	Complex oxides such as transition metal perovskites, particularly ABO3 perovskites of the type ABO3 (A=La, B= transition metal, O=oxygen) are promising catalysts for the aqueous oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), with potential application in Alkaline Fuel Cell cathodes. There is a significant interest in using atomistic simulations to help design cathode materials through the study of the nature of surface binding. However, modeling of ORR on perovskite oxides has been previously restricted only to BO2-terminated surfaces, although in practice a mixture of both AO and BO2 terminations may exist, as the exact nature of surface termination for thin-film catalyst electrodes is difficult to synthesize as well as characterize. In this study we use Density Functional Theory based thermodynamic modeling to probe the differences in the binding of oxygen (O) and hydroxyl species (OH and OOH,) on the (001)-LaO and (001)-BO2 terminations, with the focus on the material LaCrO3. We show that in the relevant aqueous conditions for alkaline fuel cell cathodes, surface species *OH, *OOH and *O bind ~2eV more strongly to the LaO-termination compared to the CrO2-terminated surfaces, and therefore, when the LaO termination is stable, can potentially passivate the oxygen reduction and evolution reaction activity of the thin-films of LaCrO3.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-6737			INSPEC:14657628

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study to reveal the thickness effect by carbonizing the isotropic and homogeneous oleylamine (OAm) ligands that cover colloidal MoS2. A thermal treatment turns OAm into a uniform carbon shell, while the size of MoS2 monolayers remains identical. When evaluated toward an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction, the calcined MoS2 catalysts deliver a volcano-type activity trend that depends on the calcination temperature. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy consistently provide an accurate quantification of the carbon shell thickness. The same variation pattern of catalytic activity and carbon shell thickness, aided by kinetic studies, is then persuasively justified by the respective limitations of electron and proton conductivities on the two branches of the volcano curve.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000862393600001	36154126

In this work, holey cobalt-iron nitride nanosheet arrays grown on Ni foam substrate (CoFeNx HNAs/NF) are prepared via a facile hydrothermal and subsequent thermal nitridation method. This unique HNA architecture can not only expose abundant active sites but also facilitate the charge/mass transfer. Resulting from these merits, the CoFeNx HNAs/NF exhibits high catalytic performance with overpotentials of 200 and 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Furthermore, when using CoFeNx-500 HNAs/NF as both anode and cathode, the alkaline electrolyzer could afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.592 V, higher than many other metal nitride-based electrocatalysts. This work signifies a simple approach to prepare holey metal nitride nanosheet arrays, which can be applied in various fields of energy conversion and storage.									46	2	0	0	0	0	47			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600034	32498507

Here, we present Raman spectra studies of the multilayer graphene (MLG) fabricated by low-pressure chemical vapor deposition over copper foil, and report that the defects of MLG can be controlled by adjusting methane concentration. Moreover, MLG can be changed from metallic to semiconductoring properties by using oxygen plasma treatment, and we investigate the defects evolution of the graphene after exposing to oxygen plasma by Raman spectra. Our results indicate that the amount of defects in graphene can be changed by regulating the methane concentration and oxygen plasma exposure times, but the primary type of defect in MLG is still boundary-like defect. It is valuable for understanding the physics of defects evolution through artificially generated defects, and such defect engineering will greatly open up the future application of the novel material.

Both rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) measurements and results obtained by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) show that the amount of insoluble Li2O2 formed is proportional to the roughness factor and corresponds to one or two monolayers if referenced to the true surface area. The amount of soluble LiO2 is independent of roughness, although the formation of the passivating Li2O2 layer takes longer.On gold electrodes less side products are formed as compared to platinum electrodes. It was furthermore found that ORR on single crystalline Pt(100) leads to two monolayers of Li2O2, while in case of Pt(111)/Pt(pc) only one mono layer was reoxidized.The shape of the reoxidation peaks in the anodic potential scan is independent of roughness, but it depends not only on the electrode material (Au or Pt) but also on the atomic surface structure. Since Tafelslopes cannot be determined directly by usual methods for such surface confined reactions, we used ac voltammetry to determine the apparent transfer coefficient (alpha') and gain some insight into the reoxidation mechanism; the obtained alpha' of 0.3 hints to a rate determining first charge transfer. This agrees well with the detection of superoxide during oxidation of Li2O2 on the surface.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000602423000008

In order to develop energy-efficient ZABs, it is highly desirable to pursue bifunctional catalysts with the accelerated reaction kinetics and the reduced overpotentials. Transition metal oxides are expected as promising alternatives to replace noble metalbased catalysts, but their catalytic activities are still far from desirable. Herein, we propose a modified layer of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (Pr,Sr)2Ni0.5Co0.5O4-delta (RP-PSNC) on the perovskite PrNi0.5Co0.5O3-delta (P-PNC) nanofiber by a simple impregnation method, receiving a (Pr,Sr)2Ni0.5Co0.5O4-delta/ PrNi0.5Co0.5O3-delta (RP-PSNC/PPNC) heterostructured nanofibers. The RP-PSNC/P-PNC hybrid catalyst exhibits a small overpotential and an excellent stability due to the large number of vacancies in the two-phase interface. The RP-PSNC/P-PNC-based liquid rechargeable ZAB reaches a power density of 145 mW cm-2, and 230 h of long-term cycle performance. When assembled into flexible ZABs, it can also reach a power density of 51 mW cm-2 and a stable open circuit voltage (~1.35 V) for 44 h. These results indicate that the bifunctional electrocatalyst of heterostructured RPPSNC/P-PNC provides a new path for the modification of perovskites through multi-phase catalysts system, and has great potential in rechargeable ZABs and other energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000819244700005

In this study, a novel electrocatalyst composed of earth abundant metals of Ni, Fe, and Co with a three-dimensional (3D) nanostructure and high activity was successfully fabricated on a Ni foam (NF) substrate through a facile hydrothermal synthesis method followed by electrodeposition. The electrode had three levels of porous structures, including the bottom supermacroporous NF substrate, flower-like CoFe2O4 with a macroporous structure, and the topmost mesoporous nanosheets of CoNi(oxy)hydroxide. Since this hierarchical architecture of CoNi/CoFe2O4/NF was binder-free, more catalytic active sites could be exposed, leading to enhanced electron transport and providing open-channels for the effective release of gas. As a result, CoNi/CoFe2O4/NF showed highly efficient electrocatalytic activity toward OER with an overpotential of 360 (+/- 5) mV to achieve a current density as high as 1000 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Meanwhile, as a cathode catalyst, it also exhibited excellent performance toward HER with overpotentials as low as 82 (+/- 3) and 189 (+/- 3) mV to deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, when it was applied as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) were obtained at applied potentials of 1.57 and 1.75 V, respectively, together with excellent durability.									102	2	0	0	3	0	102			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412000052

When O-quinones, products of the enzymatic reaction, evolve chemically to generate an O-diphenol in the reaction medium, the enzyme acts on a monophenol with O-diphenol as reductant, converting E-m to E-d. The binding of E-d to molecular oxygen gives E-ox, which is active on monophenols, but when the O-quinone product does not generate O-diphenol through chemical evolution, the monophenol does not act as an enzyme substrate. The fact that E-ox can be formed from E-m with hydrogen peroxide can be used to help identify whether a monophenol is a substrate of tyrosinase. The results obtained in this study confirm that compounds previously described as inhibitors of the enzyme are true substrates of it.									16	0	0	0	13	0	16			0916-8451	1347-6947		WOS:000330086500008	24317051

A recently developed n-pentane model was used to predict the temperature evolutions of major and intermediate species, like n-pentane, O2, CO, CO2, CH2O, C2H4, CH3CHO at varied pressure and temperature conditions. It is found that as the environmental pressure increases, the difference between high temperature oxidation and low temperature oxidation becomes less obvious because the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) is decreasing (at 10 atm and 100 atm, high temperature oxidation occurs right after low temperature oxidation). At supercritical pressures, the high temperature oxidation is governed by the branching reactions of RO2, and the addition reaction of QOOH with oxygen dominates the reaction paths at both low and high temperature oxidations because the addition reaction between QOOH and oxygen is still more important than the decomposition reaction of QOOH at high temperature and 100 atm. According to the pathway analysis and sensitivity analysis, the branching reactions of RO2 are dominating at both low and intermediate to high temperatures.					3rd International Conference on Material Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing Technology3rd International Conference on Material Engineering and Advanced Manufacturing Technology	26-28 April 201926-28 April 2019		Shanghai, ChinaShanghai, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-8981			INSPEC:19405737

This results from their inherent properties such as a large portion of surface coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms, rapid mass transfer and enhanced conductivity. However, 2D MOFs have a strong tendency to aggregate, which severely limits their potential application in the OER. Here, novel 2D Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)(2) (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, C8H4O4) hybrid nanosheets are synthesized via a facile sonication-assisted solution method. Because of the rational material design, the large surface area of Ni-BDC is maintained. Significantly, after coupling, the electronic structure of Ni atoms in the Ni(OH)(2) component is well modified, leading to the generation of Ni cations with higher oxidation states, which are desirable for the OER. As-prepared Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)(2) exhibits high activity, favorable kinetics and strong durability towards the OER. Specifically, the OER current density of Ni-BDC/Ni(OH)(2) is 82.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.6 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is significantly greater than those of Ni-BDC (5.5 times), Ni(OH)(2) (20.6 times) and Ir/C (3.0 times). Moreover, the sonication-assisted method developed in this work can be readily adapted for the preparation of various 2D MOF-based hybrid functional materials.									86	5	0	0	1	0	87			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459504400015	30734809

However, the energy density of such systems is still limited by an unsatisfying electrochemical window and the absence of voltage plateaux. To address this point, we herein propose a "potential fringe" strategy, which features a kinetically widened stable potential window and a high voltage plateau. Under this strategy, we remarkably promote the energy density of BSH by utilizing two fast battery reactions at the potential nearly below the hydrogen evolution reaction in the anode and the potential nearly above the oxygen evolution reaction in the cathode: reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hydrogel films act as the cathode and TiO2@rGO hydrogel films act as the anode with LiOH/K4Fe(CN)(6) as the electrolytes. Through coupling the two fast potential-fringe reactions - a metal cation insertion/extraction in the TiO2 electrode and a reversible redox reaction of [Fe(CN)(6)](4-)/[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) in the cathode, the alkaline BSH reaches a high voltage of 2 V with a discharge voltage plateau of 1.55 V. Compared with the 6.2 Wh kg(-1) and 20.3 Wh kg(-1) for the rGO//rGO system at 1.2 V and TiO2@rGO//rGO system at 1.7 V in LiOH/KOH electrolyte, the system delivers a high energy density of 70.4 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 2.90 kW kg(-1).									8	1	0	0	0	0	8				2566-6223		WOS:000483785900003

In this study, a unique class of Co-Fe selenide hollow nanospheres (CoSe@FeSe2) is well-designed through a facile hydrothermal method. The in situ formed hybrid composites possess numerous interfaces allowing partial electron transfer via O2- bridges to optimize the adsorption feature of the reaction intermediates, *OH, *O, and *OOH, on the catalysts. The collected surface valence band spectra evidence the optimization of the intermediate adsorption and active sites. The as-synthesized CoSe@FeSe2 exhibits excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 281 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 34.3 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte.

Herein, CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded Co-N-doped carbon nanoflake arrays (CS@CNC NAs) are grown on carbon cloth (CC) through a co-precipitation and annealing process. The CS@CNC NAs/CC hybrid electrocatalyst shows superior HER performance with a small Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), an ultralow overpotential of 84 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent long-term stability with nearly no decay even after 72 h. The outstanding HER performance of CS@CNC NAs/CC is mainly attributed to the synergetic effects of CoSe2 nanoparticles and CNC nanoflake arrays, which can not only provide rich active sites, easy access of electrolyte and diffusion of H-2 bubbles, but also guarantee its high conductivity and structural stability.

This natural product is an inhibitor (150 mu M) of oxygen evolution. Polarographic analyses of the photosynthetic partial redox reactions indicate that (a) photosystem I (PSI) activity is unaffected by odoratol, (b) there is a substantial inhibition of the electron flow of uncoupled photosystem II (PSII) as measured from water to silicomolybdate or diaminodurene, and (c)the electron flow from diphenyl carbazide to dichlorophenolindophenol of Tris-washed chloroplasts was insensitive. Collectively, these data suggest that the site of action of odoratol is located at the donor side of PSII. Comparison of chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curves of chloroplasts with authenticated donor side damage and those obtained from odoratol-treated samples further supports this interpretation. Comparative analyses using odoratol derivatives indicate that the diol moiety at positions 23 and 24 of the side chain is an important structural requirement for the inhibitory activity displayed by odoratol.									17	0	0	0	12	0	17			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000077697600086

Considerable efforts have been devoted to understand the reaction mechanisms and improving battery performance. Here, various reaction mechanisms at the cathode are discussed, including the direct electrochemical formation and decomposition of Li2O2 and LiOH and the redox mediator (RM) assisted reactions in both the discharging and charging processes. Formation of Li2O2 in discharging processes is related to the electrolyte solvent property, and its following decomposition proceeds stepwise with the intermediate of Li2-xO2. Low overpotentials have been reported in LiOH-involved discharging and charging processes, and it can alleviate the instability of carbon against Li2O2 and provide new insights into the design of practical Li-air batteries. RMs are promising for Li-O-2 batteries, and the prerequisites in addition to the redox potentials should be taken into account. Perspectives on the development of Li-O-2 batteries are provided. The future deployment of Li-O-2 batteries relies on the continuous efforts of all the scientists around the world.									111	8	0	0	4	0	111			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000418382500004

Sustainable seawater splitting requires catalysts with robust hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as well as superior chloride corrosion resistance in the salty electrolyte. Here we designed a sandwich-like Ni3S2-MoS2-Ni3S2@Ni foam (NMN-NF) catalyst on the surface of Ni foam by stacking Ni3S2 coatings as top and bottom protective layers (chloride anticorrosion), and MoS2 as an interlayer to trigger both HER and OER in salty water. The unique sandwich structure endowed NMN-NF catalysts with excellent bifunctional catalytic activity and long-term durability in alkaline seawater electrolytes. Taking advantage of the synergistic effect between MoS2 and Ni-3 S-2, NMN NF delivered a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at a low voltage of 1.82 V under operating over 100 h in alkaline seawater, allowing them a promising catalyst towards practical application for efficient seawater splitting.

In electrocatalytic water splitting, the combination of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions produces highly clean and sustainable hydrogen energy and which attracts research communities. Also, fabrication of highly active and low cost materials for water splitting is a major challenge. Therefore, in the present study, gamma -Fe2O3 nanowires were fabricated from highly available and cost-effective iron plate without any chemical modifications/doping onto the surface of the working electrode with high current density. The fabricated nanowires achieved the current density of 10mA/cm(2) at 1.88V vs. RHE with the scan rate of 50mV/sec. Stability measurements of the fabricated Fe2O3 nanowires were monitored up to 3275sec with the current density of 9.6mA/cm(2) at a constant potential of 1.7V vs. RHE and scan rate of 50mV/sec.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2045-2322			WOS:000560013900031	32214145

Hence, it may be a promising material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, one thing GaP has in common with other IIIV semiconductors is that it corrodes in photoelectrochemical reactions. Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is a chemically stable and highly active oxygen evolution reaction co-catalyst. In this study, we protected a GaP photoanode by using a 20 nm TiO2 as a protection layer and a 2 nm cobalt oxide co-catalyst layer, which were both deposited via atomic layer deposition (ALD). A GaP photoanode that was modified by CoOx exhibited much higher photocurrent, potential, and photon-to-current efficiency than a bare GaP photoanode under AM1.5G illumination. A photoanode that was coated with both TiO2 and CoOx layers was stable for over 24 h during constant reaction in 1 M NaOH (pH 13.7) solution under one sun illumination.

J	Deiner, LJ; Kang, DH; Friend, CM								Promotion of formaldehyde production from adsorbed methoxy by oxidation of Mo(110) with NO2								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				109	16			8085	8090		10.1021/jp046247q				APR 28 2005	2005	The reaction of methoxy (OCH3) in the presence of NO2 is studied on a thin-film oxide of Mo(110) for its relevance to the alkane-assisted reduction of NOx. Temperature-programmed reaction indicates that oxygen deposited by NO2 dissociation promotes formaldehyde evolution. This pathway is not observed in any appreciable amount for methoxy on the thin-film oxide of Mo(110), nor for the reaction of methoxy in the presence of NO or O-2. No new intermediates, in particular those containing C-N bonds, are detected after NO2 is exposed to the surface containing methoxy. Furthermore, infrared spectra provide evidence that the presence of NO2 does not significantly perturb the methoxy intermediate. These results indicate that surface oxidation rather than intermolecular complexation is the most likely mechanism by which NO2 promotes the evolution of oxygenates. In addition, the presence of methoxy decreases the capacity of the Mo surface to reduce NO2. No N-2 is produced, and molecular desorption predominates. There are also no NOx species present after heating to 500 K when NO2 reacts in the presence of methoxy, whereas monomeric NO and dinitrosyl are present when NO2 reacts alone. These results are discussed in the context of CH4-assisted NOx reduction.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1520-6106			WOS:000228603700068	16851944

Their structure and morphology were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) measurements, respectively. In alkaline media, electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance test showed that the performance changed with the ratio of Co3O4/CeO2, and there was an optimal value. When the mass ratio of Co3O4 and CeO2 was 58.5%, its overpotential was 347 mV which was lower than that of Co3O4 (440 mV), commercial RuO2 (359 mV) and CeO2 (570 mV), with Tafel slope of 72.7 mV.dec(-1), and the good stability in 1.0 mol.L-1 KOH solution at current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). X-ray photoelectronic energy spectra (XPS) confirmed that some of Co3O4 electrons transferred to CeO2, which resulted in increase of the conductivity of the composite materials, the surface oxygen vacancy concentration, and active oxygen species of CeO2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1001-4861			WOS:000671795300022

The platinum bronze comprises a metal platinum layer in a portion of the surface, and has a specific surface area of 20 m2/g or more. USE - Fuel-cell electrode catalyst is useful as cathode material or anode material (all claimed) in polymer electrolyte fuel cells, alkaline fuel cells, phosphate form fuel cells, etc. ADVANTAGE - The catalyst uses meso-size and fine platinum bronze having high electrochemical effective area and activity per unit weight, and excellent oxygen generation activity. When platinum bronze is used for the anode of fuel cell, high electric potential is not generated because an oxygen evolution reaction advances during anode hydrogen deficiency, and corrosion of carbon support is prevented. Since it does not dissolve in aqua regia, platinum bronze is not eluted under strong acid conditions and it is not deteriorated even when exposed to high electric potential.															0						DIIDW:201980839A

The superior catalytic activity and stability of Fe2O3@CoFe2O4 were attributed to the synergistic effects of M2+/M3+ (M denotes Co or Fe) redox cycles. SO4.-, .OH, O2.- and 1O2 were proved to be the main reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the phenol degradation process through quenching experiments and EPR measurements, while the surface-bound SO4.- played a dominant role. Trace metal ions leached during the reaction enhanced the PMS activation, and the oxygen vacancies electron transfer process played a critical role in the formation of O2.-/1O2 and the cycle of M2+/M3+ redox pairs. The formation of ROS and function of 1O2 were also revealed from bulk reaction and interface reaction. This study highlighted the simultaneous evolution of PMS reduction and oxidation to generate ROS, which provided an insight into the efficient catalytic degradation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000758285500007	34843835

Herein, a performance-enhanced electrocatalyst of Pd nanoparticles loaded on a hybrid catalytic support comprised of MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and carbon nanotube (CNT) is demonstrated. Such a hybrid catalyst enhances durability and improves both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities compared with the Pd/C catalysts. The mass specific activity and specific activity of the Pd/Ti3C2Tx-CNT catalyst are 4.4 and 3.3 times that of Pd/C for ORR, respectively. The peak power density of a alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AAEMFC) based on the Pd/Ti3C2Tx-CNT (1:2) cathode achieves 48 mW cm(-2) at 60 degrees C. Furthermore, Pd/Ti3C2Tx-CNT also exhibits rapid HER kinetics with a low overpotential of 158 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). Pd/Ti3C2Tx-CNT also provides good stability after 1000 cycles. These remarkable catalytic performances are attributed to the role of Ti3C2Tx and CNT by enhancing the catalytic activity surface area and rapid mass/charge transfer due to the synergistic effect between Pd and Ti3C2Tx-CNT.									22	2	0	0	2	0	23			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000538658200001

Herein, a metal-free sulfur-containing covalent organic framework material (JLNU-300) was designed and synthesized using thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-dicarboxaldehyde (TTDC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline solution. The test analysis results showed that JLNU-300 had high crystallinity and specific surface area (298.99 m(2) g(-1)). In addition, the material has high electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, with an overpotential value of 290 mV and a Tafel slope of 99 mv dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The introduction of thiophene groups effectively changed the electronic structure and chemical properties of the COF framework, and the high crystallinity and specific surface area of the COF itself increased the effective contact area between reactants and active points, thus promoting the HER process. The results show that the reasonable structure design of COFs can further promote their wide application in the field of electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000864127100001

Herein, we report that crystalline/amorphous Co2P/CoMoPx nanoparticles containing many active interfaces supported on nickel foam (NF) are highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER. The interface-engineered crystalline/amorphous Co2P/CoMoPx nanostructure is achieved by simple one-step electrodeposition method under a controllable constant current. The optimal electrocatalyst Co2P/CoMoPx-0.4/NF in this work exhibits superior activity for the alkaline HER with low overpotentials of -121 mV at 100 mA.cm(-2) and prominent electrochemical stability for 50 h. Excellent HER performance can be attributed to a large amount of active interfaces formed between crystalline Co2P and amorphous CoMoPx which provide effective exposure of highly active sites and promote electron transfer. This work may open up a new way for the design and preparation of earth abundant, low-cost nanostructured materials as high-efficiency HER electrocatalysts for applications in the field of electrocatalysis.									32	3	0	0	1	0	32			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800067

In previous studies we had proven that nano-anatase improved photosynthesis and greatly promoted spinach growth. The mechanisms by which nano-anatase promotes energy transfer and the conversion efficiency of the process are still not clearly understood. In the present paper, we report the results obtained with the photosystem II (PSII) isolated from spinach and treated by nano-anatase TiO2 and studied the effect of nano-anatase TiO2 on energy transfer in PSII by spectroscopy and on oxygen evolution. The results showed that nano-anatase TiO2 treatment at a suitable concentration could significantly change PSII microenvironment and increase absorbance for visible light, improve energy transfer among amino acids within PSII protein complex, and accelerate energy transport from tyrosine residue to chlorophyll a. The photochemical activity of PSII (fluorescence quantum yield) and its oxygen-evolving rate were enhanced by nano-anatase TiO2. This is viewed as evidence that nano-anatase TiO2 can promote energy transfer and oxygen evolution in PSII of spinach.									41	6	0	0	34	1	49			0163-4984	1559-0720		WOS:000249646000010	17916941

The synergistic effect of Ni and Fe is well documented but still insufficiently understood. Fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the K-edges of Ni and Fe provided structural information on the non-catalytic (reduced) and catalytic (oxidized) state of the NiFe catalyst. Time-resolved detection of X-ray signals during (i) cyclic voltammetry and (ii) in response to potential steps revealed that the Ni(2+)/Ni(3+) redox transition is directly coupled to modification of the Fe ligand environment. We propose that the lattice-geometry modification of the Ni(Fe) oxyhydroxide that results from Ni oxidation enforces changes in the ligand environment of the Fe ions. The Fe sites do not undergo a distinctive redox transition, but are enslaved by the oxidation state changes of the Ni ions.									42	0	0	0	7	0	42			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700006

Here, we prepare highly efficient NPM catalysts of cobalt and nitrogen codoped carbon nanosheets (Co/N-CNSs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using harmful environment-polluting waste of biomass catkins as carbon precursors via a mild mechanical exfoliation and chemical process which is facile, low-cost, environmentally friendly and up-scalable. Compared with a commercial platinum-based catalyst (commercial 20% Pt/C), the Co/N-CNS electrocatalysts show outstanding ORR activity, acceptable HER activity and long term stability with an onset potential of 0.92 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a half-wave potential of 0.83 V vs. the RHE in alkaline electrolytes.

J	Kim, Ga-Yoon; Lee, Jeongbin; Rho, Yeo-Jin; Kim, Woo-Hee; Kim, MinJoong; Ahn, Ji-Hoon; Ryu, Woo-Hee								Rhenium oxide/sulfide binary phase flakes decorated on nanofiber support for enhanced activation of electrochemical conversion reactions								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				446						136951	10.1016/j.cej.2022.136951				OCT 15 2022	2022	Because of their versatile application potential, such as fuel cells and water electrolysis, boosting electrochemical half-cell reactions has been highlighted to realize energy conversion systems. However, sluggish multi-charge transfer reactions lower the energy efficiency for cell operation. Tailoring hierarchical catalyst nanostructures comprising heterogeneous crystalline phases allows for the improvement of limited activities and reaction performance. This study examines the controllable synthesis of heterogeneous rhenium oxide (ReOx) and rhenium sulfide (ReS2) nanoflakes vertically aligned on carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by thermal chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Their potential application as electrocatalysts in various electrochemical half-cell reactions for fuel cells and water electrolysis is elucidated. The phase portion of oxide and sulfide in the ReOx/ReS2 nanoflakedecorated CNF catalyst can be thermally tuned from an oxide-rich phase to a sulfide-rich phase, thereby optimizing the catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution (E-onset:-0.24 V) and oxygen reduction reactions (E-onset: 0.778 V, number of electron: 3.8), which is comparable to the performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts. The morphological and structural evolution mechanism of the ReOx/ReS2 nanoflake-decorated CNF catalyst materials is investigated using diverse material characterizations. This study suggests a synthetic method for temperature dependent heterogeneous phase control of non-precious-metal-based hierarchical materials and offers a basis for developing efficient catalyst alternatives for application to sustainable energy conversion and storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000805852100001		
J	Ge, Lan; Gong, Xuzhong; Wang, Zhi; Zhao, Lixin; Wang, Yuhua; Wang, Mingyong								Insight of anode reaction for CWS (coal water slurry) electrolysis for hydrogen production								ENERGY				96				372	382		10.1016/j.energy.2015.12.077				FEB 1 2016	2016	Mechanism of CWS (coal water slurry) electrolysis was investigated by using anode reaction kinetics. The results indicated that the activation energies of electrode reaction reduce with the increase in activity of carbon materials. According to the electrode reaction kinetics, the direct oxidation of CWS electrolysis occurred easily under lower concentration of electrolyte and higher concentration of CWS. On the contrary, the indirect oxidation of CWS electrolysis took place. Because of the high oxygen evolution potential of water electrolysis in H2SO4 solution (1.23 V), the direct oxidation of CWS electrolysis mainly occurred under water decomposition potential (0.5-1.23 V). As NaOH solution was used as electrolyte, it was difficult to distinguish direct and indirect oxidation under the low potential (0.4 V). With increasing stirring rate, the electrode reaction activation energies of GWS (graphite water slurry) electrolysis increased slightly and were always lower than 40 kJ/mol. The results indicated that GWS electrolysis was controlled by diffusion and the increase in stirring rate could not reduce the polarization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pellizzari, F.; Follut, F.; Karpel, N.; Leitner, Vel								A simplified reaction model predicting the effect of some parameters on the degradation of phenol in the electron beam process								RADIOCHIMICA ACTA				94	8			481	486		10.1524/ract.2006.94.8.481				2006	2006	Electron beam irradiation is a known advanced oxidation process that is studied in the literature to examine the possibilities of pollutant removal from waters. In the present work, a common pollutant, phenol, was chosen as model molecule to investigate the capability of a simple reaction system to predict the influence of certain parameters on the efficiency of the electron beam process. This model is based on the main reactions occurring during the irradiation of aqueous solutions of phenol. It was found to simulate suitably the effect of the dissolved oxygen and of the initial concentration on the abatement of the molecule during the irradiation.Various irradiation experiments were also performed by modifying the mode of the dose deposition. The results showed that, for a given applied dose, the multiplication of the passages under the electron beam significantly improves the abatement of phenol (20%). The oxygenation of the solution and the mathematical expression of the evolution of the pollutant concentration with the radiation dose partly explain this improvement.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0033-8230			WOS:000240543700018

Considerably challenging is the controlled and reproducible synthesis of stable non-noble metallic nanostructures with accessible active sites. Here, we report a method of preparation of bare (ligand-free) Cu nanostructures from polycrystalline metal in a controlled manner. This procedure relies on heterogeneous localized electrorefining of polycrystalline Cu on indium tin oxide (ITO) and glassy carbon as model supports using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The morphology of nanostructures and thus their catalytic properties are tunable by adjusting the electrorefining parameters, i.e., the electrodeposition voltage, the translation rate of the metal source and the composition of the supporting electrolyte. The activity of the obtained materials towards the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), is studied by feedback mode SECM. Spiky Cu nanostructures obtained at a high concentration of chloride ions exhibit enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Nanostructures deposited under high cathodic overpotentials possess a high surface-to-volume ratio with a large number of catalytic sites active towards the reversible CO2RR and ORR. The CO2RR yields easily electrooxidizable compounds - formic acid and carbon monoxide. The HER seems to occur efficiently at the crystallographic facets of Cu nanostructures electrodeposited under mild polarization.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000478576700018	36132742

A tantalum iridium oxide (Ta2O5-IrO2) coating is considered to be one of the best electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media. In the present study, novel Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO coatings with varying loads of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were designed to investigate the effects of rGO on the catalytic activity and stability of the Ta2O5-IrO2 coating for the OER. Five different electrodes comprised of Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO on a titanium substrate were fabricated with incremental weight percentages of rGO (0.0 wt.%, 1.0 wt.%, 2.0 wt.%, 5.0 wt.% and 7.5 wt.%) using a facile thermal decomposition method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were employed to characterize the morphology and composition of the prepared Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO coatings. Longevity tests revealed that the incorporation of rGO into the oxide layer strongly affected the stability of the Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO electrodes. The electrochemical activities of the prepared Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO electrodes were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The Ta2O5-IrO2-rGO coating containing 1.0 wt.% rGO exhibited the greatest stability, along with enhanced OER activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000586504800001

Co3+ is the main active metal site of Co-based catalysts. In this research work, through the partial transformation of CoFePBA (CFP) via low-temperature heat treatment, the effective control of the Co3+/Co2+ ratio has been achieved. The partial transformation strategy of low-temperature heat treatment can not only maintain the original framework structure of CFP, but also increase more active sites. The characterization results show that the CFP-200 sample obtained via heat treatment at 200 degrees C for 2 h under N-2 atmosphere has the highest Co3+/Co2+ ratio. As an oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst, CFP-200 shows the best electrocatalytic activity among all samples. In 1.0 mol/L KOH electrolyte, the overpotential is 312 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Therefore, low-temperature heat treatment provides an effective method for preparing low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts.

Herein, a novel self-templating strategy was proposed to synthesize one-dimensional nanoporous RhNi alloy nanowires through combining metallurgical eutectic solidification and microalloying with chemical dealloying. In-situ X-ray diffraction and ex-situ characterizations reveal that the Al matrix served as a template to guide the growth of the Al-3(Ni, Rh) nanowires during eutectic solidification of Al-Ni-Rh precursor and was completely removed in the dealloying process. Meanwhile, the nanowire morphology could be well retained and the dealloying of Al-3(Ni, Rh) led to the formation of nanoporous RhNi alloy nanowires. The length scale of the RhNi nanowires could be facilely regulated by changing the solidification conditions. More importantly, the RhNi catalysts show excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability towards hydrogen evolution reaction in both acidic and alkaline media, which has been rationalized by density functional theory calculations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000853001600017

However, the urgent challenge in water electrolysis is to search for low-cost, high-efficiency catalysts based on earth-abundant elements as an alternative to the high-cost but effective noble metal-based catalysts. The transition metal-based catalysts are more appealing than the noble metal catalysts because of its low cost, high performance and long stability. Some recent advances for the development in overall water splitting are reviewed in terms of transition metal-based oxides, carbides, phosphides, sulfides, and hybrids of their mixtures as hybrid bifunctional electrocatalysts. Concentrating on different catalytic mechanisms, recent advances in their structural design, controllable synthesis, mechanistic insight, and performance-enhancing strategies are proposed. The challenges and prospects for the future development of transition metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts are also addressed.

However, developing non-noble metal OER electrocatalysts with high activity, long durability and scalability remains a major challenge. Herein, high OER activity and stability in alkaline solution were discovered for mixed nickel/cobalt hydroxide electrocatalysts, which were derived in one-step procedure from oriented surface-mounted metal-organic framework (SURMOF) thin films that had been directly grown layer-by-layer on macro- and microelectrode substrates. The obtained mass activity of similar to 2.5 mA.mu g(-1) at the defined overpotential of 300 mV is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the benchmarked IrO2 electrocatalyst and at least 3.5 times higher than the mass activity of any state-of-the-art NiFe-, FeCoW-, or NiCo-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature. The excellent morphology of the SURMOF-derived ultrathin electrocatalyst coating led to a high exposure of the most active Ni- and Co-based sites.									79	4	0	0	3	0	79			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000464769000045	30888800

In this work, we present and elucidate the workings of an OER catalytic system which consists of cobalt oxide (CoOx) with adsorbed Fe3+ ions. The CoOx was electrodeposited onto glassy-carbon-disk electrodes, while Fe3+ was added to the 1 M KOH electrolyte. Linear sweep voltammetry and chronopotentiometry were used to assess the system's OER activity. The addition of Fe3+ significantly lowered the average overpotential (eta) required by the cobalt oxide catalyst to produce 10 mA/cm(2) O-2 current from 378 to 309 mV. The Tafel slope of the CoOx + Fe3+ catalyst also decreased from 59.5 (pure CoOx) to 27.6 mV/dec, and its stability lasted similar to 20 h for 10 mA/cm(2) O-2 evolution. Cyclic voltammetry showed that oxidation of the deposited CoOx, from Co2+ to Co3+ occurred at a more positive potential when Fe3+ was added to the electrolyte. This could be attributed to interactions between the Co and Fe atoms. Comprehensive X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy were conducted. The in situ XANES spectra of Co sites in the CoOx, CoOx + Fe3+, and control Fe48Co52Ox ]catalysts were similar during the OER, which indicates that the improved OER performance of the CoOx + Fe3+ catalyst could not be directly correlated to changes in the Co sites. The XANES spectra of Fe indicated that Fe3+ adsorbed on CoOx did not further oxidize under OER conditions. However, Fes coordination number was notably reduced from 6 in pure FeOx to 3.7 when it was adsorbed on CoOx. No change in the Fe-O bond lengths/strengths was found. The nature and mechanistic role of Fe adsorbed on CoOx are discussed. We propose that Fe sites with oxygen vacancies are responsible for the improved OER activity of CoOx + Fe3+ catalyst.									124	6	0	0	5	0	126			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000008

However, this remains a grand challenge. Herein, a robust strategy to rationally craft hierarchical structured bifunctional electrocatalysts composed of 3D CoS2 nanocages interconnected on 2D CoS2 nanosheet arrays (denoted hierarchical CoS2 nanocages) for high-performance CO2 splitting is developed. The subsequent calcination removes the partial S edges of CoS2, thereby strongly suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of CoS2. By combining theoretic and experimental results, for the first time, it is discovered that the plane S of CoS2, instead of S edges, are highly active for CO2RR but inactive for HER, rendering the plane S as ideal active sites for CO2RR. Intriguingly, the composition tuning via calcination and the presence of a hierarchical architecture confer hierarchical CoS2 nanocages respective outstanding CO2RR and OER performance. Notably, the hierarchical CoS2 nanocages can be exploited as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall CO2 splitting to yield the current density of 1 mA cm(-2) at a small cell voltage of 1.92 V, much lower than the widely reported values (>2.5 V).									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000531857700001

Electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4/N-rGO to hydrogen peroxide reduction was tested by cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. Under a reduction potential at -0.6 V to H2O2, this constructing H2O2 sensor exhibits a linear response ranging from 0.2 to 17.5 mM with a detection limit to be 0.1 mM. Although Co3O4/rGO or nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) alone has little catalytic activity, the Co3O4/N-rGO exhibits high ORR activity. The Co3O4/N-rGO hybrid demonstrates satisfied catalytic activity with ORR peak potential to be -0.26 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and the number of electron transfer number is 3.4, but superior stability to Pt/C in alkaline solutions. The same hybrid is also highly active for OER with the onset potential, current density and Tafel slope to be better than Pt/C. The unusual catalytic activity of Co3O4/N-rGO for hydrogen peroxide reduction, ORR and OER may be ascribed to synergetic chemical coupling effects between Co3O4, nitrogen and graphene.									96	4	0	0	2	0	96			2045-2322			WOS:000395753900001	28272415

The S dopants of graphene are suggested to be one of the binding sites and to be responsible for improving the intrinsic activity of the Co sites. The turnover frequency of such Co sites is greater than that of many Co-based nanostructures and IrO2 catalysts. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, the pathway for the evolution of the Co cation-based molecular catalyst for the OER was further demonstrated on such a single Co-ion site for the first time. The Co2+ ions were successively oxidized to Co3+ and Co4+ states prior to the OER The sequential oxidation was coupled with the transfer of different numbers of protons/hydroxides and generated an active Co4+= O fragment. A side-on hydroperoxo ligand of the Co4+ site is proposed as a key intermediate for the formation of dioxygen.									106	9	0	0	6	0	104			0002-7863			WOS:000393848400036	28098444

The 2Fe2As-centred beta-diketiminato complex, having an unusual planar Fe2As2 core structure, results from the salt-metathesis reaction of the corresponding beta-diketiminato (FeCl)-Cl-II complex and the AsCO- (arsaethynolate) anion as the monoanionic As- source. The as-prepared FeAs phase produced from the precursor has been electrophoretically deposited on conductive electrode substrates and shown to act as a electro(pre)catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The deposited FeAs undergoes corrosion under the severe anodic alkaline conditions which causes extensive dissolution of As into the electrolyte forming finally an active two-line ferrihydrite phase (Fe2O3(H2O)(x)). Importantly, the dissolved As in the electrolyte can be fully recaptured (electro-deposited) at the counter electrode making the complete process eco-conscious. The results represent a new and facile entry to unexplored nanostructured transition-metal arsenides and their utilization for high-performance OER electrocatalysis, which are also known to be magnificent high-temperature superconductors.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000588192000014	34123210

Herein, in virtue of volcano plots drawn by theoretical calculation, the (001) facet was screened as the superb facet of orthorhombic CoSe2 for OER. Afterwards, CoSe2(001) nanosheets were synthesized and the exposure ratio of (001) facet is controllable with thermodynamics methods effectively. The single-facet CoSe2(001) delivered an overpotential as low as 240 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, which outperformed the bulk (380 mV) as well as other CoSe2-base OER catalysts reported before. Especially, a shorter Co-Co path was observed in CoSe2(001) by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Further density functional theory (DFT) studies revealed that the reversible compression on the shorter Co-Co path could regulate the electronic structure of active sites during the OER process, and thus the energy barrier of the rate-determining step was reduced by 0.15 eV. This work could inspire more insights on the modification of electronic structure for OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000640747600003

Preliminary theoretical calculations with the density functional theory method indicate that the existence of graphene oxide is favorable for the adsorption and subsequent four-electron reduction reactions of O-2. Furthermore, this oxygen-enriched hybrid material was tested as a cathode in aprotic/aqueous hybrid electrolyte Li-air batteries. The hybrid material exhibited a very low overpotential (the voltage gap at 0.1 mA cm(-2) is only 0.17 V) and better electrocatalytic performance owing to abundant oxygen containing groups and its excellent electroconductivity. These experimental and theoretical demonstrations should provide an important mechanistic insight into carbon-based metal-free catalysts in fuel cells and metal-air battery applications. We believe that the demonstrations shown in this paper provide a promising strategy to investigate highly efficient metal-free catalysts for advanced energy devices.									51	0	0	0	3	0	51			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000308893400036

Here, we incorporate acid radical ion into materials' lattices to construct a LRMO with gradient ion concentration and layer-spinel mosaic structure via a practical and controllable strategy of chemical de-lithium route. The experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the phosphate radical (PO43-) enter the lattice to enhance the vacancy energy of the material, which can improve the structural stability, inhibit oxygen evolution and voltage decay. As results, the best modified LRMO (PTS-20) exhibits suppressed voltage decay (similar to 27.16 mV at 1 C after 200 cycles) and higher initial discharge specific capacity of 283.5 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 C with high ICE of 95.4%. Insitu differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) further demonstrate that PTS-20 has less oxygen evolution. Furthermore, full cells assembled with graphite behave excellent electrochemical performances at 1 C. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate LRMO cathodes with promising practical electrochemical performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000819873900002

Herein, we demonstrated robust aqueous and flexible ZABs with novel three-dimensional dual-linked hexaiminobenzene metal-organic framework (Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF)-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and superionic functionalized bio-cellulose electrolytes (64 mS cm(-1)). The well-defined quintet-shelled hollow sphere MOFs possess a hierarchical porous structure, excellent packing density with a surface area of 2298 m(2) g(-1), and chemical stability as compared to conventional MOFs. Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF exhibited superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic activity (0.627 V) with half-wave potential (0.883 V) for oxygen reduction and overpotential (280 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) for oxygen evolution reactions, outperforming commercial Pt/C and RuO2. Their favorable oxygen reactions and surface electronic structures were confirmed by density functional theory. Significantly, the Mn/Fe-HIB-MOF cathode demonstrated the highest lifetimes reported to date for rechargeable ZABs, namely 1000 h (0.75 V voltage gap@10 mA cm(-2)) over 6000 cycles and 600 h (efficiency approximate to 65.24%@25 mA cm(-2)) over 3600 cycles with excellent flexibility for liquid and all-solid-state flexible ZABs, respectively. These promising results illustrate the great potential of these novel hexaiminobenzene MOFs and superionic bio-cellulose membranes for the commercial implementation of rechargeable ZABs.									187	16	0	0	5	0	188			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000459741700021

Transition metal based catalysts with double metal composition exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER or UOR due to their synergetic effect and coupling of different active sites. However, the development of OER/UOR bifunctional electrocatalysts is unsatisfying and the role of each metallic active site in the OER and UOR is still unclear. Herein, we report a Fe-Mn based OER and UOR bifunctional catalyst through a simple one-step electrodeposition method. For the OER, the introduction of Mn improves the conductivity of the catalysts and fine-tunes the electron density of the Fe active sites. For the UOR, both Fe and Mn act as active sites and their coupling effect further improves the UOR activity. The catalyst with the optimal Mn/Fe ratio achieved an overpotential of 237 mV for the OER and a potential of 1.35 V for the UOR at 100 mA cm(-2). This study provides a simple synthesis protocol for constructing bifunctional catalysts for green hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000870689700001	36268588

The fabrication of Pd@Pt core-shell structures, good control of surface atom arrangement, and the formation of an alloy structure with 3d transition metals have been approved as efficient approaches to address this issue; however, it remains a challenge to meet all these three requirements. This paper describes a facile green route for preparing concave Pd@PtNi catalysts with controllable structural evolution. The concavity and thickness of the shells could be controlled by tuning specific experimental parameters. We quantitatively analyzed the deposition rate and diffusion rate of adatoms and found that the concave surfaces of Pd@PtNi nanocrystals were due to the distinct atom deposition and diffusion rate. The as-prepared concave Pd@PtNi nanocubes exhibited greatly enhanced catalytic activities (e.g., oxygen reduction reaction) and durability than commercial Pt/C catalysts. DFT calculations further suggest that, the cooperated Ni reduced the adsorption strength of OH, resulting in the enhancement of the electrochemical properties. These results provided an attractive strategy for designing catalysts with controllable morphology and composition by depositing active metals as ultrathin shells.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000387857700008	27722398

Uniformly distributed porosity in the 3D architecture of carbon support materials allows reactant molecules to access more electrochemically active centres and simultaneously facilitate removal of the product formed during electrochemical reactions. Herein, we have prepared a nitrogen-doped entangled graphene framework (NEGF), decorated with NiFe-LDH nanostructures by an in situ solvothermal method followed by freeze-drying at high vacuum pressure and low temperature. The freeze-drying method helped to prevent the restacking of the graphene sheets and the formation of a high surface area nitrogen-doped entangled graphene framework (NEGF) supported NiFe-LDHs. The incorporation of the NEGF has significantly reduced the overpotential for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution. This corresponds to an overpotential reduction from 340 mV for NiFe-LDHs to 290 mV for NiFe-LDH/NEGF to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The preparation of the catalyst is conceived through a low-temperature scalable process.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			2516-0230			WOS:000528673500031	36132328

Much effort has been made by various research teams worldwide to look into the specific catalyst design such as nano-structuring, defect engineering or hybrid structures. But what evades us is the fundamental preparation method for the dispersion of powdered MoS2. Individual research teams with their best practices might be subjective and not validated by extensive experimental results. In this report, we find that the overpotential for the catalysis of HER varies from 0.57 to 0.72 V (freshly prepared) when different dispersion media are used, such as acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylformamide, ethanol, methanol and water. In terms of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis, less significant differences were found. With both HER and ORR pertinent to the fuel cell industry, this report would serve as an insight to readers when comparing the results of MoS2 atalysis across the literature from different research groups when different solvents were used as the dispersion medium.									21	2	0	0	1	0	22			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000396031200030	28203654

The oxidation reactions, microstructure evolution, scale stability and temperature limit were examined in our research and a good correspondence was obtained between theoretical predictions and experimental results. Microstructure evolution and stability are significantly dependent on both temperature and composition. SiO2 is thermochemically stable below 1800 degrees C and will lose its protective properties at temperatures above 2300 degrees C. The temperature limit for ZrB2-SiC composites is strongly dependent on the vapor pressure of the gaseous products and volume content of ZrB2. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The size of the supported metal species is one of the decisive factors in determining the activity of heterogeneous catalysts. Particularly, the unsaturated coordination environment of metal atoms preferably act as the active centers, minimizing these metal species can significantly boost the specific activity of every single metal atom. Single-atom catalysts/catalysis (SACs), containing isolated metals atomically dispersed on or coordinated with the surface of a support material, represent the ultimate utilization of supported metals and maximize metal usage efficiency. Graphene, a two-dimensional star material, exhibiting extraordinary physical and chemical properties, has been approved as an excellent platform for constructing SACs. When atomically dispersed metal atoms are strongly anchored on the graphene surface, featuring ultra-high surface area and excellent electronic properties, SACs offer a great potential to significantly innovate the conventional heterogeneous catalysis, especially in the field of electrocatalysis. In this review, a detailed discussion of graphene-supported SACs, including preparation approaches, characterization techniques and applications on typical electrocatalytic reactions is provided. The advantages and unique features of graphene-supported SACs as efficient electrocatalysts and the upcoming challenges for improving their performance and further practical applications are also highlighted.									24	3	0	0	2	0	24			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000580890500001	33002887

The rates and rate laws for ozone loss, soot mass gain, and CO2 and H2O formation have been determined at 22 degrees C. The rates and the rate laws associated with the increase of soot mass, due primarily to the formation of surface carboxylics, show differences between freshly-prepared and aged soot. Part of this difference has its origin in the adsorption of molecular oxygen, which participates in the ozone-soot reaction. Material balance calculations reveal that while O-3 decomposition exceeds O-containing product formation (CO2, H2O, carboxylics), one stage of the reaction shows excess product apparently due to the involvement of O-2. A complex reaction sequence is seen to involve essentially three reaction stages: a rapid initial catalytic O-3 decomposition, followed by rapid mass increase and CO2 and H2O evolution, continuing with a long period of oxidation during which the rate of ozone loss is second order in ozone. The latter observation implies the involvement of atomic oxygen in the oxidation process.					5th International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles in the Atmosphere5th International Conference on Carbonaceous Particles in the Atmosphere	AUG 23-26, 1994AUG 23-26, 1994	Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab; Lawrence Livermore Natl LabLawrence Berkeley Natl Lab; Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab	LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATL LAB, BERKELEY, CALAWRENCE BERKELEY NATL LAB, BERKELEY, CA	45	3	0	0	7	0	48			2169-897X			WOS:A1996VE25800059

Much work has been executed towards developing semiconducting light absorbers (SC) and co-catalysts (CC) for photoelectrochemical (PEC) and particulate photocatalytic (PPC) water splitting systems. However, minimal insights exist into how the formation of junctions between highly dispersed CC clusters and nanoparticle SCs influences the reactivity of the system, as compared to the reactivity of the CCs in electrochemical environments. In this work, 15 materials consisting of five different CC nanoclusters deposited on three different nanoparticle SCs were synthesized, characterized, and tested for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The SCs were chosen based on their similar n-type behavior and low OER activity, and the CCs were chosen based on their benchmarked OER reactivity in electrochemical measurements. We found that the photocatalytic activity of these samples for the OER did not directly correlate with the reactivity of the CCs measured under electrochemical conditions. Instead, the performance was controlled by interfacial effects specific to each SC|CC junction. CC electrical conductivity and SC supplied OER overpotential were the major factors identified to strongly affect OER rate. This work suggests that when designing an optimal photocatalyst, one can not simply deposit the most active CC (as measured in electrochemical conditions) on the SC which absorbs the highest fraction of the solar flux, as the CC-SC pairing requires critical interfacial considerations.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000384241800009

Here, the catalytic activity of a novel catalyst composed of Co9-xNixS8 nanoparticles immobilized on N-doped carbons (Co9-xNixS8/NC) is reported. The catalyst is synthesized using a Ni-adsorbed Co-Zn zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursor (NiCoZn-ZIF). Because of the porous structure of ZIF and the high intrinsic activity of the bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles, the Co9-xNixS8/NC catalyst exhibits high half-wave potential 0.86 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode for ORR and outstanding bifunctional catalytic performance. When Co9-xNixS8/NC is applied as a cathode catalyst in zinc-air batteries, considerably higher power density of about 75 mW cm(-2) and discharge voltage are achieved compared to those of batteries with commercial Pt/C and other ZIF-derived catalysts.

The oxygen evolution potential and effective area of the MWCNTs-OH-PbO2 electrode were 1.5 and 3.7-fold higher than the traditional PbO2 electrode. Electroche mical degradation of pyridine in aqueous solution was investigated by using the MWCNTs-OH-PbO2 anode. Based on pyridine decay rate (93.8%), total organic carbon reduction (84.6%), and energy consumption (78.8 Wh L-1 order(-1)) under the optimal conditions, the MWCNTs-OH-PbO2 electrode modified with IVIWCNTs-OH concentration of 1.0g L-1 exhibited higher electrochemical oxidation ability than the traditional PbO2 electrode. The intermediate, hydroxypyridine, was found at the first stage of electrolysis. The primary mineralization product, NO3-, was detected in aqueous solution after electrolysis. A possible electrochemical mineralization mechanism including two potential routes, i.e., via formation of small organic molecules by ring cleavage reaction and direct mineralization to CO2 and NO3-, was proposed. The results demonstrated that the MWCNTs-OH-PbO2 electrode exhibited high efficiency for pyridine mineralization in aqueous solution under mild conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we highlight a fluorine-doped nickel-based heterostructure, in which fluorine doping displays a dual effect in Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets/Ni3S2 heteronanorods. On the one hand, fluorine doping can facilitate the formation of Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets/Ni3S2 heteronanorods through one-step in situ growth on nickel foams. The unique heterostructure enables good exposure of abundant active sites and highly active heterointerfaces. On the other hand, the uniform incorporation of fluorine can effectively modulate the electron density at the Fermi level of Ni3S2, contributing to the improved electrical conductivity and charge transfer efficiency, further improving the electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The optimal heterostructure presents a low overpotential of 360 mV to reach the OER current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Finally, this heterostructure also displays a superior UOR anodic peak current of about 322.9 mA cm(-2), almost the highest value at the anodic peak compared to the literature.									41	1	0	0	1	0	41			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000451762800033	30376026

In the present work, we modulate the phase transition of tungsten oxide from hexagonal to the monoclinic by tuning annealing conditions in vacuum environment. This phase transition also accompanies the incorporation of oxygen vacancies in crystal structures. WO3-x annealed at 550 degrees C (Vac-550) shows a transition from heaxagonal to monoclinic with superior hydrogen evolution activity, exhibiting a Tafel slope of only 30 mV/dec, which is comparable that of commercial Pt/C. XRD, in situ TEM, EPR, and XPS analysis provide detailed insights into the structural transition as well as oxygen vacancy concentration of the annealed WO3-x samples in a vacuum environment. This work paves the way towards a generalized methodology for enhancing electrochemical activity by the vacancy modulation in transition-metal oxides.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2196-0216			WOS:000475512500025

However, in order for IF to be employed as paleomarine proxies, lumped-process distribution coefficients for the element of interest must be experimentally determined or assumed. This necessitates consideration of bulk ocean chemistry and which authigenic ferric iron minerals controlled the sorption reactions. It also requires an assessment of metal mobilization reactions that might have occurred in the water column during particle descent and during post-depositional burial. Here, we summarize recent developments pertaining to the interpretation and fidelity of the IF record in reconstructions of oceanic trace element evolution. Using an updated compilation, we reexamine and validate temporal trends previously reported for the nickel content in IF (see Konhauser et al., 2009). Finally, we reevaluate the consequences of methanogen Ni starvation in the context of evolving views of the Archean ocean-climate system and how the Ni famine may have ultimately facilitated the rise in atmospheric oxygen.									41	0	0	0	15	0	41			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000363930700005	26426143

The authors find that a low growth temperature (250 degrees C) and a high oxygen flux (200 sccm) led to a small grain size and a high porosity of the Gd2O3 film. Lowering the oxygen flux to 50 sccm led to reduced film porosity, presumably due to the increased diffusion length of the Gd atoms on the surface. Increasing the growth temperature to 650 degrees C resulted in a film with large columnar grains and elongated pores at the grain boundaries. Thin films grown at 250 degrees C consisted of cubic Gd2O3, but thermodynamically less stable monoclinic phase formed as the film thickness increased. Lowering the oxygen flux apparently further promoted the formation of the monoclinic phase. Furthermore, monoclinic phase dominated in the films grown at 650 degrees C. Such phase transitions may be related to the stress evolution of the films at different temperatures, thicknesses, and oxygen fluxes. Enhanced Gd2O3/Si interfacial reaction was observed as the growth temperature, film thickness, and oxygen flux increased. Moreover, oxygen was found to play a crucial role in the Gd2O3/Si interfacial reaction and the formation of Gd-Si-O interface layers, which proceeded by the reaction of excess oxygen with Si followed by the intermixing of SiOx and Gd2O3.

Sr doping in LaCoO3 (La1-xSrxCoO3) has been found to substantially increase its catalytic activity. In this work, we report a detailed study on the evolution of the electronic structure of La1-xSrxCoO3 with 0 <= x <= 1 and its correlation with electrocatalytic activity for the OER. A combination of X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to unravel the electronic density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level (E-F), which provide insights into the key electronic structure features for the enhanced OER catalytic activity. Detailed analysis on the Co L-edge XAS suggest that LaCoO3 has a low spin state with t(2g)(6) e(g)(0) configuration at room temperature. This implies that the high OER catalytic activity of LaCoO3 should not be rationalized by the occupancy of e(g) =1 descriptor. Substituting Sr2+ for La3+ in LaCoO3 induces Co4+ oxidation states and effectively dopes hole states into the top of valence band. A semiconductor-to-metal transition is observed for x >= 0.2, due to the hole induced electronic DOS at the EF and increased hybridization between Co 3d and O 2p. Such an electronic modulation enhances the surface adsorption of the *OH intermediate and reduces the energy barrier for interfacial charge transfer, thus improving the OER catalytic activity in La1-xSrxCoO3. In addition, we found that the La1-xSrxCoO3 surface undergoes amorphization after certain period of OER measurement, leading to a partial deactivation of the electrocatalyst. High Sr doping levels accelerated the amorphization process. (c) 2021 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Metal organic frameworks were considered as efficient precursors for overall water splitting catalysts. In this paper, NC/Ni-Co3O4@Co1-xS with small size is obtained from ZIF-67. NC/Ni-Co3O4@Co1-xS materials exhibit superior overall water splitting properties, with a low overpotential of 170 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2) and 210 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability. Furthermore, the overall water splitting only requires 1.64 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), when the NC/Ni-Co3O4@Co1-xS are used as both anode and cathode. NC/Ni-Co3O4@Co1-xS has excellent electrocatalytic activity due to its nanosheet structure, which greatly increases the electrochemically active surface area and the NC/Ni-Co3O4@Co1-xS has good electrical conductivity and abundant Co3+ sites, so the electrocatalytic activity is significantly enhanced. This study provides a new idea for the design and synthesis of novel composite electrocatalysts.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000788425100001

Herein, we report the facile fabrication of the hierarchical Ni2P-Co2P-Fe2P hybrid hollow nanoprism (abbreviated as NiCoFeP-HN), which could efficiently work as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst in the rechargeable Zn-air battery. NiCoFeP-HN was synthesized via an in situ ion exchange reaction of nickel-cobalt precursors with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) at room temperature and the subsequent phosphorization at 300 degrees C under N-2. The ion exchange procedure was crucial for preserving the nanoprism morphology and enhancing the OER performance. NiCoFeP-HN exhibited satisfactory activity with a small overpotential of 294 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and remarkable stability for over 12 h. Compared to the conventional RuO2 + Pt/C Zn-air battery, the NiCoFeP-HN + Pt/C based Zn-air battery has exhibited superior energy density and much better cycling stability. This work presents a facile and efficient avenue for the construction of hollow nanostructures and hybrid compositions, and provides a promising candidate with good electrochemical performance and energy storage.									43	2	0	0	3	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000496150500026

Density functional theory calculation in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that S-doping decreases the electron density near the Fermi level to reduce the metallic nature of Co2P. Thus, a more positive charge is induced onto Co to balance between hydride (Co delta+ H delta-) and proton (S/P delta- H delta+) acceptors. As a result, it increases the number of active Co2+ sites as well as the turnover frequency of a single site. The hybrid electrodes obtained by loading S:Co2P nanoparticles on N-doped carbon cloth or nickel foam (NF) exhibit an outstanding activity and stability of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline electrolytes outperforming conventional, precious metal-based Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts, and most of the other state-of-the-art nonprecious metal electrocatalysts reported so far. An alkaline electrolyzer with S:Co2P@NF as both cathode and anode produces a stable current density of 100 mA/cm(2) at 1.782 V, which is superior to the IrO2 - Pt/C electrolyzer (1.823 V).									50	0	0	0	1	0	50			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000454567100019

Pristine MOFs with their recent development are summarized first followed by composites of MOFs with their enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Overall water splitting by using bifunctional electrocatalysts derived from MOFs with different synthetic approaches is provided and this review gives the metal-based categorisation of precursor MOFs.

Efforts are being made in producing cheap and effective electrodes from new materials to make hydrogen production more efficient. Gas evolution, in all cases, requires an accurate analysis of electrochemical behavior of electrodes to quantify efficiency, improvement, or stability. Knowing the exact gas volume by any method in real time during electrochemical water splitting is urgently needed. Taking inspiration from the existing technique broadband acoustic resonance dissolution spectroscopy (BARDS), we demonstrate an original approach to continuously track the electrochemical water splitting via the gas volume evolution from hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) processes. The technique may be used to unravel the true features of new electrode materials that evolve hydrogen and correlate material electrochemistry to the true gas volume evolved in real time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300084

In this study, the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen during the cyclic reaction was examined using Fe3O4/C-YSZ particles in order to demonstrate reproducible and stoichometric oxygen/hydrogen production through a repeatable two-step reaction. Subsequently, a ceramic foam device coated with Fe3O4 and c-YSZ particles was prepared and examined as a thermochemical water-splitting device in a directly irradiated receiver/reactor hydrogen production system. The Fe3O4/C-YSZ system formed a Fe-containing YSZ (Fe-YSZ) by high-temperature reaction between Fe3O4 and the c-YSZ support at 1400 degrees C in an inert atmosphere. The reaction mechanism of the two-step water-splitting cycle is associated with the redox transition of Fe2+-Fe3+ ions in the c-YSZ lattice. The Fe-YSZ particles exhibit good reproducibility for reaction with a hydrogen/oxygen ratio of approximately 2.0 throughout repeated cycles. The foam device coated with Fe-YSZ particles was also successful for continual hydrogen production through 32 repeated cycles. A 20-27% ferrite conversion was obtained using 10.5 wt% Fe3O4 loading over an irradiation period of 60 min. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Iridium is the commonly efficient oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. But the reserve in earth is a shortage. Herein, an ordered array electrode in feature of the defective Ir film decorated on external WOx nanorods (WO(x)NRs) is designed. Electrodeposition is carried out to prepare an iridium coating (similar to 68 nm in thickness) to guarantee the ordered morphology. This novel electrode obtained brilliant I-V performances (2.2 A cm(-2)@2.0 V) and 1030 h stability (0.5 mA cm(-2)) with a reduced loading of 0.14 mgIr cm(-2). The uniform dispersion Ir catalyst on the WOx substrate benefits to enhance Ir mass activity and improve the poor conductivity originating from WOx. Compared with that of sprayed electrode, the threshold current density of mass transport polarization region can be expande to at least 3.0 A cm(-2) for ordered structure electrode attributed to the abundant water storage bulk. This novel Ir@WO(x)NRs electrode occupies a huge potential to defuse the cost and durability issues confronting with the PEMWE.									10	2	0	0	0	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000639014900024	33761742

Herein, we find that the OER electrocatalysis can be dramatically improved by synergistically forming disordered electronic structures and superficial amorphous layers, as superficial oxyhydroxide, phosphorus-doped NiFe(2)O(4)nanoarrays on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (OP-NiFe2O4/NCNFs). Unveiled by the depth-profiling analysis from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the contents of phosphorous doping in the OP-NiFe(2)O(4)nanoarrays change dynamically from outside to inside due to itsin situsuperficial reconstruction into the oxyhydroxide layer, thereby accelerating electron transfer between heterogeneous phases. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, this amorphous oxyhydroxide layer and dynamically varied phosphorous content would positively shift the d-band center of the NiFe2O4-related compounds, leading to lower adsorption energy towards water molecule. Thus, the OP-NiFe2O4/NCNF electrocatalyst displays a low overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 44.8 mV dec(-1)in an alkaline medium.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000541868300008	32420574

The two-dimensional structure based on CoOOH nanosheets is easy to handle in the preparation process, low in cost, and has a small overpotential during water decomposition. Therefore, CoOOH two-dimensional materials have been widely used as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we summarize the application of two-dimensional CoOOH nanosheets in the field of oxygen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. First, the different preparation methods of two-dimensional CoOOH nanosheets are briefly introduced. The structure-activity relationship of the two-dimensional CoOOH catalyst was analyzed from different viewpoints, such as doping, defects, etc. Finally, different catalytic mechanisms of CoOOH-based catalysts are discussed, and studies at the density functional theory (DFT) level are also provided to support the above mechanisms. To improve the readability of this review, a concise overview at the end of each section is given to illustrate some of the characteristics and trends of the studies in the corresponding part. The opportunities and challenges of two-dimensional CoOOH as an electrocatalyst in the future are summarized in the Conclusion section. This work will provide new insights and perspectives to the readers to understand the role of CoOOH nanosheets in the OER process.									35	1	0	0	2	0	35			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000599748600003	33216072

All the materials were more active towards the reduction of oxygen than towards the reduction of nitric oxide, except Pt at 400 degrees C. As a general trend it was observed that the activity of the materials towards the reduction of oxygen increases more than the activity of the materials towards the reduction of nitric oxide with increasing temperature. The Ni wire was covered with a layer of NiO. The NiO layer inhibits the reduction of both nitric oxide and oxygen. No sign of the formation of an oxide layer on the platinum and gold wires was observed. Pt was the most active electrode material towards the reduction of nitric oxide. Au showed almost no activity towards the reduction of nitric oxide, but Au was active towards the reduction of oxygen. This implies that the triple-phase boundary (3PB) catalyses the reduction of oxygen but not the reduction of nitric oxide, as Au is a catalytic inactive metal. All the materials were more active towards oxidation than towards reduction that is evolution of oxygen or oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide was more pronounced than the reduction reactions.									15	4	0	0	1	0	18			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000254804700002

Electric energy is mainly consumed by the sluggish anodic oxy-gen evolution reaction (OER). The electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has been regarded as a promising reaction to replace OER because of its small thermodynamic oxidation potential. However, developing a facile and large-scale preparation method for bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR electrocatalysts is still challenging. Herein, phosphate-modified (4.46 atomic%) NiMoO4-x net-like nanostructures are formed on Ni foam (NF) via H3PMo12O40 etching strategy at room temperature (denoted as NF/P-NiMoO4-x). The etched NF can directly serve as HER electrode, and delivers overpotential of 116 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with Tafel slope of 77.5 mV/dec. Furthermore, it displays excellent UOR activity with potential of 1.359 V at current density of 10 mA/ cm(2) and Tafel slope of 19.3 mV/dec. The apparent activation energy of NF/P-NiMoO4-x is 20.6 kJ/mol, lower than that of NF (37.7 kJ/mol), indicating smaller apparent barrier for CAN bond cleavage in urea. The cell voltage of urea electrolysis is around 1.48 V for H-2 production to deliver current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and better long-term stability for 50 h than that of Ir/C||Pt/C. The etching solution can be recycled for five times by addition of H2O2, turning heteropoly blue into its original state. This work develops a facile and large-scale method to prepare bifunctional HER and UOR electrocatalysts for H-2 pro-duction in a less-energy saving way via urea electrolysis. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

We herein report a novel hybrid 1D heterogeneous nanorods based on nickel-iron phosphide and molybdenum dioxide (NFPMO) grown on nickel foam that presents highly outstanding electrocatalytic performance in electrochemical overall water splitting, both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The applied cell voltage of employing NFPMO electrode in overall water splitting merely require 1.41 V and 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2) working electrolysis current density, respectively, and it can bear high stably upon hundreds of hours long-term electrolysis operation.

Here, an interfacial engineering strategy to construct an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst by in situ growing N-doped WS2 nanoparticles on highly conductive cobalt nitride (N-WS2/Co3N) for concurrent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good conductivity of Co3N, rich well-oriented edge sites and water-dissociation sites at the nanoscale interfaces between N-WS2 and Co3N, the resultant N-WS2/Co3N exhibits remarkable HER activity in 1 m potasium hydroxide (KOH) requiring a small overpotential of 67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding long-term durability at 500 mA cm(-2), representing the best alkaline hydrogen-evolving activity among reported WS2 catalysts. In particular, this hybrid catalyst also shows exceptional catalytic activities toward theurea oxidation reaction featured by very low potentials of 1.378 and 1.41 V to deliver 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) along with superb large-current stability in 1 m KOH + 0.5 m urea. Moreover, the assembled two-electrode cell delivers the industrially practical current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.72 V with excellent durability in alkaline urea-containing solutions, outperforming most MoS2-like bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting reported hitherto. This work provides a promising avenue for the development of high-performance WS2-based electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000848789500001	36047970	
J	Clausen, Juergen; Junge, Wolfgang								The inhibitory effects of acidification and augmented oxygen pressure on water oxidation								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				98	1-3			229	233		10.1007/s11120-008-9321-2				OCT 2008	2008	Cyanobacteria, algae, and plants produce dioxygen from water. Driven and clocked by light quanta, the catalytic Mn4Ca Tyrosine centre accumulates four oxidizing equivalents before it abstracts four electrons from water and liberates dioxygen and protons. Intermediates of this reaction cascade are short-lived (<100 mu s) and difficult to detect. By application of high oxygen pressure to cyanobacterial PSII-core-complexes, we have previously suppressed the transition from the highest oxidation state of the centre to the lowest by stabilizing a (peroxy) intermediate. Here, we investigated the inhibitory interplay of acidification and augmented oxygen pressure. Starting from pH 6.5, acidification increasingly inhibited the reduction of the highest oxidized state and resulted in a lower oxygen partial pressure for half inhibition. Oxygen and proton interfere with different steps of the reaction cascade.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000261577900021	18712490

Herein, we identified that the WGS reaction can be, in principle, catalyzed by rhodium-manganese oxide clusters Rh2MnO1,2- in the gas phase at room temperature. This is the first example of the construction of such a potential catalysis in cluster science because it is challenging to discover clusters that can abstract the oxygen from H2O and then supply the anchored oxygen to oxidize CO. The WGS reaction was characterized by mass spectrometry, photoelectron spectroscopy, and quantum-chemical calculations. The coordinated oxygen in Rh2MnO1,2- is paramount for the generation of an electron-rich Mn+-Rh- bond that is critical to capture and reduce H2O and giving rise to a polarized Rh+-Rh- bond that functions as the real redox center to drive the WGS reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-7185			WOS:000696175700009	34463512

Here, we construct an unsupported nanoporous catalyst with a Pt- Pd shell of sub-nanometre thickness on Au, which demonstrates an initial ORR activity of 1.140Amg(Pt)(-1) at 0.9V. The activity increases to 1.471Amg(Pt)(-1) after 30,000 potential cycles and is stable over a further 70,000 cycles. Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and atomically resolved elemental mapping, the origin of the activity change is revealed to be an atomic-scale evolution of the shell from an initial Pt-Pd alloy into a bilayer structure with a Pt-rich trimetallic surface, and finally into a uniform and stable Pt-Pd-Au alloy. This Pt-Pd-Au alloy possesses a suitable configuration for ORR, giving a relatively low free energy change for the final water formation from adsorbed OH intermediate during the reaction.									236	17	1	0	12	0	240			2058-7546			WOS:000411264300018

Molecular oxygen (O-2) is currently variably present in microenvironments and has driven adaptation and microbial differentiation over the course of evolution on Earth. Obligate anaerobes use enzymes and cofactors susceptible to low levels of O-2 and are restricted to O-2-free environments, whereas aerobes typically take advantage of O-2 as a reactant in many biochemical pathways and may require O-2 for essential biochemical reactions. In this Perspective, we focus on analogous enzymes found in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, modification, and degradation that are catalyzed by O-2-sensitive radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes and by O-2-dependent metalloenzymes. We showcase four transformations for which aerobic organisms use O-2 as a cosubstrate but anaerobic organisms do not. These reactions include oxidative decarboxylation, methyl and methylene oxidation, ring formation, and ring cleavage. Furthermore, we highlight biochemically uncharacterized enzymes implicated in reactions that resemble those catalyzed by the parallel aerobic and anaerobic enzymes. Intriguingly, several of these reactions require insertion of an oxygen atom into the substrate, which in aerobic enzymes is facilitated by activation of O-2 but in anaerobic organisms requires an alternative mechanism.									10	1	0	0	3	0	11			0006-2960			WOS:000456350100003	30365306

Mass spectrometric measurements of gross O-2 evolution and uptake were made concurrently with measurements of net CO2 uptake and chlorophyll fluorescence at different irradiances and leaf temperatures of 30 and 40degreesC. In all C-4 grasses gross O-2 uptake increased with increasing irradiance at very high CO2 partial pressures (pCO(2)) and was on average 18% of gross O-2 evolution. Gross O-2 uptake at high irradiance and high pCO(2) was on average 3.8 times greater than gross O-2 uptake in the dark. Furthermore, gross O-2 uptake in the light increased with O-2 concentration at both high CO2 and the compensation point, whereas gross O-2 uptake in the dark was insensitive to O-2 concentration. This suggests that a significant amount of O-2 uptake may be associated with the Mehler reaction, and that the Mehler reaction varies with irradiance and O-2 concentration. O-2 exchange characteristics at high pCO(2) were similar for NAD-ME and NADP-ME species. NAD-ME species had significantly greater O-2 uptake and evolution at the compensation point particularly at low irradiance compared to NADP-ME species, which could be related to different rates of photorespiratory O-2 uptake. There was a good correlation between electron transport rates estimated from chlorophyll fluorescence and gross O-2 evolution at high light and high pCO(2).									20	0	0	0	21	0	21			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000186973900004

Herein, a 2D CoFe selenite is prepared as a promising OER catalyst in high yield via a simple metal-ion self-assembly strategy under hydrothermal conditions. The obtained CoFe selenite exhibits superior OER electrocatalytic activity with a relatively low overpotential of 257 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 45.6 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte; particularly, it has excellent intrinsic activity with a high mass activity of 730.9 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 0.49 V. Besides, it shows long-term stability and maintains a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for more than 12 h of continuous water splitting. The superior electrocatalytic performance should be ascribed to its unique 2D layered structure, which is favorable for ion diffusion and mass transportation; above all, the synergistic effect between SeO3 anions and bimetallic centers could regulate its electronic structure, leading to enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000597581100019

Four-and two-electron ORR occurred at platinum and GC electrodes, respectively, whereas no well-defined ORR took place at nickel and copper electrodes. Although MB was found to be electrochemically inactive, the electrochemical behavior, especially, change in the peak potential and current in the cyclic voltammetric results in the presence of MB at platinum and GC electrodes varied interestingly. MB underwent following chemical reaction with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in situ during ORR as supported by steady-state hydrodynamic voltammetric measurements. Ultraviolet-visible spectral behavior of MB changed when it was allowed to react with ROS generated by bulk electrolysis of O-2 at a GC plate electrode. It was revealed that electrochemical ORR is a promising route for degradation of an organic dye in aqueous solution. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

REDUCTION OF NITROBENZENE USING A FLOW-THROUGH PT-NAFION(R) CELL								DENKI KAGAKU				62	12			1188	1195		10.5796/electrochemistry.62.1188				DEC 1994	1994	A flow-through cell using a solid polymer electrolyte composite electrode with low Pt-loading (0.9 mg cm-2) was fabricated, and was served for the reduction of nitrobenzene. The current efficiency of aniline production was ca. 80% at current densities up to 32 mA cm-2. A small amount of a dimerized compound, which was not produced with a batch cell, was formed as a by-product. The current efficiency decreased significantly at current densities greater than 32 mA cm-2. Even in the low current density region (up to 32 mA cm-2) the current efficiency decreased with increasing charge passed beyond ca. 2000 C. This decrease in current efficiency was caused by hydrogen evolution and the permeation of aniline to the anolyte. The oxidation of iodide ion was examined as the anodic reaction in place of oxygen evolution. The cell voltage was lower than 1.0 V, and was stable for a long period. However, the decrease in current efficiency with charge passed was more significant than that using oxygen evolution as the anode reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0366-9297			WOS:A1994PX77200022

As a class of promising catalysts, the nanocoposites of transition metal nanoparticles that are encapsulated with nitrogen-doped carbon nanoshells are considered as promising substitutes to expensive precious metal based catalysts. In this work, we demonstrate the successful preparation of high-density cobalt nanoparticles encapsulated in very thin N-doped carbon nanoshells by the pyrolysis of solid state cyclen-Co-dicyandiamide complex. The morphologies and properties of products can be conveniently tuned by adjusting the pyrolysis temperature. Owing to the synergetic effect of hybrid nanostructure, the optimized Co@N-C-800 sample possesses outstanding bifunctional activity for both ORR and OER in alkaline electrolyte. Meanwhile, the corresponding rechargeable zinc-air battery that is based on Co@N-C-800 air cathode also has excellent current density, low charge-discharge voltage gap, high power density, and strong cycle stability, making it a suitable alternative to take the place of precious metal catalysts for practical utilization.									7	1	0	0	0	0	8				1996-1944		WOS:000459719000047	30642079

Support-free porous Mn2O3 was synthesized by a facile aerosol-spray-assisted approach (ASAA) and subsequent thermal treatment, and exhibited ORR activity that is comparable to commercial Pt/C The catalyst also exhibits notably higher activity than other Mn-based oxides, such as Mn3O4 and MnO2. The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) study indicates a typical 4-electron ORR pathway on Mn2O3. Furthermore, the porous Mn2O3 demonstrates considerable stability and a good methanol tolerance in alkaline media. In light of the low cost and high earth abundance of Mn, the highly active Mn2O3 is a promising candidate to be used as a cathode material in metal-air batteries and alkaline fuel cells.									42	1	0	0	4	0	42			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000380271900004	27258474

Approaches to solar water splitting include photocatalytic water splitting with homogeneous or heterogeneous photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical or photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) water splitting with a PEC cell, and electrolysis of water with photovoltaic cells coupled to electrocatalysts. Though many materials are capable of photocatalytically producing hydrogen and/or oxygen, the overall energy conversion efficiency is still low and far from practical application. This is mainly due to the fact that the three crucial steps for the water splitting reaction: solar light harvesting, charge separation and transportation, and the catalytic reduction and oxidation reactions, are not efficient enough or simultaneously. Water splitting is a thermodynamically uphill reaction, requiring transfer of multiple electrons, making it one of the most challenging reactions in chemistry.This Account describes the important roles of cocatalysts in photocatalytic and PEC water splitting reactions. For semiconductor-based photocatalytic and PEC systems, we show that loading proper cocatalysts, especially dual cocatalysts for reduction and oxidation, on semiconductors (as light harvesters) can significantly enhance the activities of photocatalytic and PEC water splitting reactions. Loading oxidation and/or reduction cocatalysts on semiconductors can facilitate oxidation and reduction reactions by providing the active sites/reaction sites while suppressing the charge recombination and reverse reactions. In a PEC water splitting system, the water oxidation and reduction reactions occur at opposite electrodes, so cocatalysts loaded on the electrode materials mainly act as active sites/reaction sites spatially separated as natural photosynthesis does. In both cases, the nature of the loaded cocatalysts and their interaction with the semiconductor through the interface/junction are important. The cocatalyst can provide trapping sites for the photogenerated charges and promote the charge separation, thus enhancing the quantum efficiency; the cocatalysts could improve the photostability of the catalysts by timely consuming of the photogenerated charges, particularly the holes; most importantly, the cocatalysts catalyze the reactions by lowering the activation energy. Our research shows that loading suitable dual cocatalysts on semiconductors can significantly increase the photocatalytic activities of hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, and even make the overall water splitting reaction possible. All of these findings suggest that dual cocatalysts are necessary for developing highly efficient photocatalysts for water splitting reactions.									2153	173	0	0	145	1	2178			0001-4842			WOS:000323472200024	23530781

Herein, cobalt phosphide nanoparticles with high P/Co ratio are synthesized and display overpotentials of 348 mV (or 343 mV) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with surface oxidized active species formed and 200 mV (or 184 mV) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 1 M NaOH (or 1 M KOH) at 10 mA cm(-2). The improved OER could be ascribed to the smaller particle size for increased active site number and more importantly the improved intrinsic activity probably assisted by more phosphates formed during electrocatalytic reaction; while the improved HER performance is mainly attributed to the increased active sites in the form of Co-P bonds. In a two-electrode configuration, the catalysts exhibit excellent overall water splitting performance, with 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.58 V and a long-time reaction stability without attenuation during 10 h operation.

High activity and good stability of bifunctional electrocatalysts are very critical for Zn-air cell. Herein, Co particles embedded in highly porous N-doping carbon nanocube (Co/HP-NC) has been successfully fabricated by pyrolyzing bimetallic Co/Zn-zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF) and further evenly loaded with metallic Ru nanoparticles to obtain Ru-coated Co/HP-NC (Ru@Co/HP-NC). Benefiting from introduction of Zn, Ru@Co/HP-NC shows the large pore volume, small Co particles, high surface contents of Co4N and pyridinic/graphitic N. Furthermore, theoretical and experimental results further demonstrate that synergy of Ru coating with Co/HP-NC can greatly improve the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) property of Ru@Co/HP-NC. Furthermore, Ru@Co/HP-NC based Zn-air batteries present the high open circuit potential of 1.4 V, large power density of ~210 mW cm-2, high discharge capacity (791 mAh g-1) and super-long cycling life (~475 cycles) with small overpotantials (~0.89 V). Notably, flexible Zn-air cell with Ru@Co/HP-NC cathode also displays excellent flexibility and superior cycling stability under different bending conditions. The work provides the simple and reliable way to prepare high-efficient electrocatalysts for high-performance metal-air systems. copy 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2566-6223			INSPEC:21802949

The ultra-thin nano -sheet for the nickel-iron (oxy)hydroxides tightly grown on the porous PANI exhibits the enhanced electrochemical characteristics associated with the promotion roles of the PANI layer, which increases the number of active sites, facilitates the charge transfer, and ac-celerates water transport across the interfaces of the electrode. The as-prepared NF/PANI/ NiFe-OH has reliable lower overpotentials of 260, 340, and 490 mV without iR-correction at 50, 100, and 200 mA cm-2 of high current densities, respectively. The smaller Tafel slope, larger ECSA, and TOF values of the electrode reveal its high intrinsic activity. Moreover, the electrode shows good stability and durability without the damage of morphology, change of surface chemical state, and substantial loss of active components at high current density.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the weak binding of oxygenated intermediates and the exposure of a few active sites on NiFe hydroxides considerably hinder their catalytic activity. Based on the fact that the W6+ ions possess higher valency. and similar ionic radius with respect to the Fe2+, Fe3+, and Ni2+ ions, which can modulate the (NiO6) crystal structure and enhance the interaction of block electrons, we have tried to introduce a trace amount of W6+ into FexNi1-x(O)OH. To our surprise, the target product Fe0.03W0.03-Ni LDHB exhibited the lowest overpotential of 205(+/- 3) mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), and no obvious decrease in the electrocatalytic activity after more than 50 hour operation or 3000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical studies revealed a synergistic interplay among tungsten, iron and nickel for producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure, which enhanced the OER performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400018

For this approach to be economical on a large scale, the overpotentials for the electrode reactions and the high-cost of nickel-based electrode substrates must be reduced. We report here on the performance of an "all-iron" electrolyzer cell that uses inexpensive steel-based electrodes. This alkaline water electrolyzer uses a steel mesh coated with a thin catalytic coating of alpha-nickel hydroxide for the oxygen evolution electrode, and another steel mesh sputter-coated with nickel and molybdenum for the hydrogen electrode. An alkaline electrolyzer with these steel-based electrodes, a commercial Zirfon separator, and a solution of 30% potassium hydroxide exhibited an electrolysis cell voltage of 1.83 V and 1.71 V at 100 mA cm(-2)when operating at 23 degrees C and 70 degrees C, respectively. We show that the performance of the steel-based electrodes is comparable to commercial electrodes based on nickel substrates. When the cell was operated continuously for 100 h at 1 A cm(-2)at 23 degrees C, there was no measurable loss in performance, providing a preliminary confirmation of the robustness of these iron-based electrodes and electrocatalysts. We conclude that cost-effective iron-based electrolyzers could be a promising route to low-cost hydrogen production.									6	0	1	0	0	0	6			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000558929700001

Herein, we proposed a unique molten-salt method (MSM) to manipulate the electronic properties of LaCoO3 by fine-tuning its crystal facet and atomic doping. LaCoO3 samples with oriented (110) (LCO (110)) and (111) (LCO (111)) facets were motivated by a capping agent (Sr2+). Compared with the LCO (111) plane, the LCO (110) and Sr-doped LCO (111) (LSCO (111)) planes possessed higher O 2p positions, stronger Co 3d-O 2p covalencies, and higher Co spin states by inducing CoO6 distortion, thus leading to superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances. Specifically, the overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) were 299, 322, and 289 mV for LCO (110), LCO (111), and LSCO (111), respectively. In addition, the (110) crystal facet and Sr substitution bestowed enhanced stability on LaCoO3 due to the strengthened Co-O bonding. The present work enlightens new avenues of regulating electronic properties by crystal facet engineering and atom doping and provides a valuable reference for the electron structure-electrocatalytic activity connection for OER and HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000790682200001

In this study, the NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-LDH NSs) were developed on Ni nanowires (NWs) via the in situ assembly of oriented 2D nanosheets. Because of its unique composition and hierarchical NS@NW structure with the conductive Ni NW core as electron conduit, this material catalyst performs as a superior electrocatalyst toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), exhibiting a low onset overpotential of 230 mV in 1 M KOH. Remarkably, NiFe-LDH NSs can be readily converted to Fe-doped Ni2P nanosheets (Fe-Ni2P NSs) or Fe-doped NiSe2 nanosheets (Fe-NiSe2 NSs) upon phosphorization or selenization treatments, which are both excellent electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. Consequently, two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzers have been constructed using NiFe-LDH NSs as anode and Fe-Ni2P NSs or Fe-NiSe2 NSs as cathode, which can afford a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 1.69 and 1.76 V, respectively, with excellent long-term durability.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000483434700016

Here, we correlate the O-atom adsorption strength with the OER activity of graphene nanoribbon systems and define the energy parameters (Delta G(O)-Delta G(OH)) to identify the overpotential (eta). The pi electron based descriptor can predict the catalytic activity of the graphene surfaces. Machine learning algorithms like Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are trained on the data generated by density functional theory to predict the overpotential. An optimal active site for OER using proposed SVR model is identified with overpotential (0.29 V) and then validate through DFT calculations. To generalize the study, we used SVR model on N doped GNR to predict the site-specific activity towards OER. Such a combined approach can be extended to estimate the site-specific OER activity of different carbon catalysts at a dramatically reduced computational cost.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621625500005

As the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes the bottleneck in water splitting, the development of efficient OER catalysts is highly desirable. As a potential electrocatalyst for this reaction, we demonstrate herein a facile two-step method to synthesize FeOOH/FePOx porous nanotubes, which involve the phosphorization of -FeOOH nanotubes that are hydrothermally prepared with the assistance of polyoxometalates (POMs). The acidity of POMs readily modulates the pore size and surface area of the nanotubes. Benefitting from the porous and hollow feature to expose multiple active sites, the FeOOH/FePOx porous nanotubes can be used as a high-performance electrocatalyst, which offers an overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with extraordinary stability in 300 h operation.

This material is one of the representatives of a new class of two-dimensional nanocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Calculations show the absence of a band gap for model structures of crystalline and nanoscale mackinawite. In the model of oxidized nanoscale mackinawite, half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by oxygen atoms, and the band gap is 0.37 eV. The band-gap broadening can explain the appearance of catalytic activity in oxidized nanoscale mackinawite. The X-ray absorption spectra show a high sensitivity of the method to changes in the local atomic environment, especially in the first coordination sphere of iron atoms. The calculated model spectra allow determination of the features of the local atomic and electronic structure of the nanoscale mackinawite surface during the hydrogen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1027-4510	1819-7094		WOS:000667487100023

Highly uniform and dense Mo-Fe-N NPs achieves full coverage on surface of the CNTs with good interactions and enhanced hetero-charge transfer, thus leading to improvements in both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated hybrid shows small overpotential of 106 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 420 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER, along with prospective stability after 20 h of continuous testing in alkaline electrolyte (1.0 M KOH). The catalytic activities of the Mo-Fe-N/CNTs material are shown to be superior to those of other synthesized catalysts as well as of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts.

The obtained catalyst had a core-shell structure wherein, Fe-Fe3C particles were encased within shells of N-doped carbon (FO800). Due to the synergetic interplay among its components, FO800 displayed excellent OER activity. Notably, FO800 delivered the current density of 10 mA cm-2, and 50 mA cm-2 at a low overpotential of 330 mV, and 380 mV with a Tafel slope of 52 mV dec- 1. Moreover, at an overpotential of 350 mV FO800 displayed a turnover frequency of 0.02 s- 1 indicating that FO800 possesses high intrinsic activity which is comparable to that of RuO2. Owing to the presence of a protective carbon shell FO800 displayed excellent stability for 24 h. The role of Fe3C, N doping, and C shell, in determining the overall OER activity was also examined. Our experimental observations suggest that the incorporation of Fe3C in the N-doped carbon improves the charge transfer efficiencies at the electrode-electrolyte interface by increasing the Donor density.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000831519100001

In this study, monodispersed IrCo hollow nanoparticles (HNPs) were prepared through a one-pot process, which affords excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance toward overall water splitting in an acidic medium. Alloying Jr with 3d transition metals (M) proved to be a key component in increasing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity by reducing the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates on IrM. The overpotentials for OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of 281 and 23 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, exceed the capabilities of commercial IrO2 and Pt/C catalysts. This phenomenon can be credited to the alloying effect and the unique hollow structure of IrCo HNPs as well as the strong electron interactions brought about by Jr-Co atomic-level synergistic alloying effects. An overall water splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.52 V, demonstrating an innovative way for efficient high-purity hydrogen generation in an acidic medium.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10				2574-0970		WOS:000603402500027

Transition metal nitrides are emerging as cost-effective substitutes for state-of-the-art noble metal based catalysts, but large OER overpotentials plague these nitrides. Herein, we developed the heterostructure of CoO-domain-anchored Co4N nanowhiskers as an effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for both OER and HER in neutral media. The exterior CoO targets OER, and the CO4N matrix is active for HER. The periodically-aligned {111} crystalline planes between Co4N and CoO provide good electron transport through their interface. The heterostructure performs dual functions of elevating activity and diminishing interior resistance of the catalyst. Moreover, the porous metallic Co4N nanowhiskers were integrated on a nickel foam, and this configuration contributes an arterial channel for collecting current as well as a spacious surface area for increasing the reaction cross section for heterocatalysis. These advantages actuate our bifunctional 3D catalytic electrode to achieve low OER and HER overpotentials in neutral systems. It finally provides an unprecedentedly low cell voltage (1.79 V for 10 mA cm(-2)) for catalyzing overall water splitting in neutral media.									73	2	0	0	4	0	73			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000453550700007

Herein, with FeNi-PBA as both a precursor and morphological template, we demonstrate the rational construct of costeffective (Fe,Ni)S-2@MoS2/NiS2 hollow hybrid heterostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline overall water splitting. Microstructural analysis shows that the hybrid is a kind of hierarchical heterostructure composed of MoS2/NiS2 nanosheets/nanoparticles in situ grown on hollow (Fe,Ni)S-2 nanocubes with abundant heterointerfaces, which effectively maximizes the electrochemical active sites to the accessible electrolyte ions, leading to the promoted charge transfer. As expected, the hybrid shows remarkable alkaline electrocatalytic performance, such as hydrogen evolution overpotential of 176 mV and oxygen evolution overpotential of 342 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), as well a cell voltage of 1.65 V at 20 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the stability and durability are greatly enhanced under harsh electrochemical conditions.

It is still a great challenge to develop high activity and stability bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same medium. To date, the emerging 2D MXenes have been extensively studied in the field of electrocatalysis because of their interesting surface physicochemical characteristics. However, the preparation process is very complex and difficult. Their intrinsic electrocatalytic properties are not good enough due to the disordered terminal groups (-OH/-F/-Cl). Herein, the traditional preparation procedure is optimized, and the 2D layered compound Ta2CS2 is directly synthesized by a one-step method. Unlike the typical MXenes with disorderly terminated groups, Ta2CS2 is terminated orderly with S atoms, and it shows excellent conductivity and electrochemical properties. Based on the great performance for OER and HER, the exfoliated Ta2CS2 (Ta2CS2-E) is found to be an outstanding bifunctional catalyst of MXenes-based materials for overall water splitting.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2688-4062		WOS:000735906800001

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction showed that 1-5 resulted in the grid layer stacked 3D (1 and 2), 2D (3 and 4) and 1D (5) frame structures due to their different coordination modes. Electrochemical analyses showed that 1-5 displayed efficient catalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) under alkaline conditions. Besides, 1-2 with the stacked 3D framework could present a large interaction and result in a low overpotential of their OER behaviour, compared to the 2D (3 and 4) and 1D (5) frameworks. MOF 2 with a 3D frame structure and Ni-II as the active central ion gave the lowest required overpotential (130 mV) to generate a current density of 1 mA cm(-)(2).									3	1	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000677441800001

Introducing ligand of foreign metals is a promising approach to optimize the electronic structure of electrocatalyst and regulate chemisorption behavior of intermediate species.Herein, Ru(OH)(x)Cl-y cluster-modified CoNi alloy nano-particles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphene (Ru-CoNi@NC-X) was prepared by a partial galvanic replacement method. The electrochemical results indicated that a moderated Ru(OH)(x)Cl-y cluster was beneficial to improve the both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) properties of CoNi alloy nanoparticles (CoNi@NC). The optimal Ru-CoNi@NC-2 electrocatalyst exhibited a low overpotential of 240 and 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER in alkaline solution, respectively. The outstanding performance was presumably attributed to the amalgamation of properties and the synergistic effects stemming from individual components. This simple and facile strategy could possibly be extended to fabricate a series of Ru(OH)(x)Cl-y clusters on metal nanoparticles, which can be applied to diverse fields.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200033

The optimum concentration of GA for growth and oxygen evolution was 10(-4) M, and NADP photoreduction was also enhanced. A pronounced effect was evident on the photosystem It-Hill reaction, while the effect on the photosystem I-Mehler reaction was much less. A concentration of 10(-6) M GA exerted some inhibition on growth and photosynthetic reactions, while 10(-2) and 10(-3) M concentrations led to complete lysis. The optimum concentration of GA for maximum nitrogenase activity was 10(-5) MI which also increased heterocyst differentiation.									2	0	0		2	0	2			0026-2633			WOS:A1994NN06300002

However, many of the active sites introduced by heteroatom doping are hardly accessible within the bulk carbon structure and consequently contribute little to the catalytic activity. Here we report a facile ionic liquid-assisted method for synthesizing mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbons, enabling enrichment of nitrogen atoms at the pore surface, demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature -programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD). The resulting metal-free nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity in HER. The accessible and efficient utilization of nitrogen atoms is responsible for the superior HER catalytic activity.									35	0	0	0	4	0	35			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000424728800086	29266923

However, the degradation mechanism of FePc during the acidic ORR has been largely unclear to date. Herein, five most likely degradation factors affecting FePc-based ORR activity are individually investigated and compared. The attack by free radicals is found to be the main reason for the instability of FePc. Assisted by the combination of several spectroscopic methods, we successfully identify the degradation products and then propose a full structural evolution of molecular FePc degradation. Finally, high similarity in the decay mechanism between molecular FePc and practical Fe/N/C catalysts was present. This study provides a clear picture of the currently missing degradation mechanism of molecular FePc during acidic ORR, which will assist future investigations on the performance degradation of practical Fe/N/C catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000849615500001

Our recent report assessed this role for Co3O4 using a flow-through DEMS cell, which requires a large volume of electrolyte. Herein, we extend this procedure to different Co3O4 catalyst loadings and particle sizes as well as the mixed Ag + Co3O4 catalyst. We introduce, for the first time, a novel small-volume DEMS cell design capable of using disc electrodes and only <0.5 mL of electrolyte. The reliability of the cell is demonstrated by monitoring gas evolution during OER in real time. This cell shows high sensitivity, high collection efficiency, and very short delay time. DEMS results reveal that only the interfacial part (similar to 0.2% of the total loading or 25% of surface atoms) of the catalyst is active for OER Interestingly, the amount of oxygen exchanged on the mixed Ag + Co3O4 catalyst is higher than that on the single Co3O4 catalyst, which illustrates the improved electrocatalytic activity previously reported on this mixed catalyst. Furthermore, the real surface area of the catalysts is estimated using different methods (namely, the ball model, double layer capacitance, isotope exchange, and redox peak methods). The surface areas estimated from the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and ball models are comparable but roughly three times higher than that of the redox peak method. Our method represents an alternative approach for probing the mechanism and real surface area of catalysts.									17	2	0	0	1	0	18			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000491219900010	31525032

The temporal evolution of electric conductivity under a voltage stress was obtained computationally by solving the transport equations for ionic and electronic defects coupled with the defect reaction equilibrium equations. The computational results are compared to the corresponding experimental measurement under similar conditions. It is shown that the local electron and hole concentrations are controlled by the local electronic defect equilibria rather than by their quasi steady state diffusional transport. It is the electric field-induced migration of oxygen vacancies and the subsequent instantaneous reestablishment of the local defect equilibria that lead to the resistance degradation. The resistance degradation behavior and the defect distributions under a long-term voltage stress are strongly influenced by the sample-annealing oxygen partial pressure, degrading electric field, and temperature. The present study contributes to the understanding of resistance degradation mechanism and provides guidance to improve the lifetime and reliability of wide band-gap semiconducting capacitors.

Virtually every realm of the Earth sciences-biology, geology, geochemistry, oceanography and atmospheric science-is needed to piece together an understanding of the history of oxygen. Over the past decade, new data from these fields has shown that there were two significant increases in atmospheric O-2 levels at around 2.4-2.3 and 0.8-0.6 billion years ago, respectively. Throughout Earth history, oceanic sulfate concentrations appear to have increased in accord with greater O-2 evels, while levels of methane, a strong greenhouse gas, may have inversely mirrored O-2. Both oxic transitions occurred in eras characterized by "Snowball Earth" events and significant disturbances in the carbon cycle, perhaps associated with increases in O-2 and losses of methane. To understand what controlled the oxygenation of the atmosphere, it is necessary to determine how O-2 is consumed on geologic time scales through reaction with reductants released from the Earth's crust and mantle. There was apparently a long delay between the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis and oxygenation of the atmosphere, and a plausible explanation is that excess reductants scavenged photosynthetic O-2 from the early atmosphere. However, a quantitative understanding of how and why O-2 became abundant on our reducing planet is still lacking. Thus, the study of the early atmosphere remains a frontier field with much to be discovered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A nanoporous Ni(OH)(2) film was electrochemically deposited using water electrolysis, in which hydrogen bubbles acted as a dynamic template, and the generated hydroxide ions caused precipitation of Ni2+ ions from the solution. The capillary action of nanopores was used to introduce Fe3+ ions that were precipitated in the nanopores by dipping into a KOH solution. A series of characterization methods and electrochemical techniques were used to characterize the physicochemical properties and electrocatalytic behavior of the prepared catalyst toward OER. Experimental results suggest that the incorporation of Fe(OH)(3) into the nanoporous Ni(OH)(2) film to a level of similar to 4%mol can significantly enhance its electrocatalytic activity toward OER. The OER current density observed for as-synthesized Fe(OH)(3)parallel to Ni(OH)(2) was higher by a factor of 3.9 compared to the original nanoporous Ni(OH)(2). The enhanced performance resulted from the interfacial synergistic effects between the two hydroxides, likely due to the improved electronic structure and increased density of oxygen vacancies. Our synthetic method is quite simple, cost-effective, and holds great potential for practical application in water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000839966000001

Most of these enzymes belong to the family of haem-copper oxygen reductases. Intraprotein proton-conducting pathways are needed for the chemical reaction and for the translocated protons. Based on sequence and structural analyses, and site-directed mutagenesis, two proton channels were established for the mitochondrial-like oxygen reductases. However, the amino acid residues forming these channels are not conserved among the family members. Most importantly, many oxygen reductases do not contain ionisable amino acid residues in the putative proton pathways nor in alternative positions. The diversity of channels in h em-copper oxygen reductases exemplifies the plasticity of proton pathways that occurred throughout evolution, and strongly suggests a substantial role for water as the main proton carrier.

While most studies focus on the original construction of active sites in electrocatalysts, it is also necessary to optimize the microenvironment in the dynamic catalytic process. Here, we proposed a pulse-induced strategy to achieve the in-situ regulation of active sites and interface microenvironment in ORR process, enabling a 210 % leap in H2O2 yield and a 74 % increase in Faraday efficiency. A series of operando measurements revealed the stabilization effect on the catalyst morphology and oxygen-containing functional groups distribution, and the activation effect on the basal defect sites to strengthen the interaction with *O2 and *OOH. Density functional theory calculations were further employed to reveal a unique ORR reaction pathway which decoupled the proton transfer and electron transfer process in pulsed electrocatalysis, providing new insights into the origin of ORR activity and selectivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000826505800005

The morphology, crystal phase composition, BET surface area and pore size distribution of the electrodes were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and N-2 physical adsorption techniques, respectively. The properties of oxygen evolution at the three-dimensional electrode system were studied and the electrocatalytic property was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The electrochemical degradation of artificial phenol wastewater was conducted in a multi-electrode reactor. Results showed that the catalytic layer of as-prepared ceramic particle electrodes had large BET surfaces and abundant micropores, which were beneficial for the electrocatalytic reaction. Results also indicated that the electrocatalytic degradation occurred where oxygen evolution took place. The multi-electrode system was far better at degrading phenol than a two-dimensional electrode system. The removal ratio of phenol and total organic carbon (TOC) were 92.3% and 66.7%, respectively. This study demonstrates that a three-dimensional electrode system exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance.									5	17	0	0	0	0	21			1000-6818			WOS:000266221400005

Current efforts mainly focus on optimal chemical doping and substituent to tune its electronic structures for enhanced activity. Here, we study its morphology control and elucidate the morphology-dependent catalyst performance for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Three types of NiCo2O4 catalysts with significantly distinct morphologies were prepared using temple-free, Pluronic-123 (P-123) soft, and SiO2 hard templates, respectively, via hydrothermal methods followed by calcination. Whereas the hard-template yields spherelike dense structures, soft-template assists the formation of a unique nanoneedle cluster assembly containing abundant meso- and macropores. Furthermore, the effect of morphology of NiCo2O4 on their corresponding bifunctional catalytic performance was systematically investigated. The flowerlike nanoneedle assembly NiCo2O4 catalyst via the soft-template method exhibited the highest catalytic activity and stability for both ORR and OER. In particular, it exhibited an onset and half-wave potentials of 0.94 and 0.82 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, for the ORR in alkaline media. Although it is still inferior to Pt, the NiCo2O4 represents one of the best ORR catalyst compared to other reported carbon-free oxides. Meanwhile, remarkable OER activity and stability were achieved with an onset potential of 1.48 V and a current density of 15 mA/cm(2) at 1.6 V, showing no activity loss after 20 000 potential cycles (0-1.9 V). The demonstrated stability is even superior to Ir for the OER. The morphology-controlled approach provides an effective solution to create a robust three-dimensional architecture with increased surface areas and enhanced mass transfer. Importantly, the soft template can yield a high degree of spinel crystallinity with ideal stoichiometric ratios between Ni and Co, thus promoting structural integrity with enhanced electrical conductivity and catalytic properties.									116	3	0	0	4	0	117			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000419082000033	29210270

The optimal NiCo@NC-900 exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7), respectively. More importantly, a neutral electrolyzer using NiCo@NC-900 as both HER and OER electrodes achieves high stability with over 140 h and requires a low cell voltage of 1.75 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The remarkable stability and superior activity origin form the unique hierarchically porous and encapsulated structure, large surface area, abundant exposing active sites, and synergistic effect between the highly catalytic active NiCo alloy nanoparticles and high-conductivity N-doped carbon nanofibers, as demonstrated by the detailed analysis before and after HER and OER testing.

J	Wang, Yuxue; Zhao, Yu; Wu, Ailian; Dong, Zhishuai; Li, Jia; Wang, Junwen								Hydrogen Production Using Electrodeposited Ni and Ni/Co on Carbon Paper as Cathode Catalyst in Microbial Electrolysis Cells								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE				13	11			10848	10858		10.20964/2018.11.71				NOV 2018	2018	Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) utilize microorganisms to decompose organic matter in wastewater and produce hydrogen at the cathode. Thus, a low-cost and highly active cathode material is of great important in such system. In this study, electrodeposited Ni, Co, and Ni/Co on carbon paper (CP) were prepared as cathode to replace platinum. At an applied voltage of 0.7 V, the Ni MEC cathode produced most gas of 11.40 mL at current density of 15.31 A m(-2), which was 73.24% higher than that of bare CP electrode (3.05 mL). Linear sweep voltammetry and Cyclic voltammetry measurements showed that the hydrogen evolution performance of the Ni cathode was significantly better than Co and Ni/Co cathodes. The tafel plots proved that the hydrogen evolution overpotential of Ni cathode (59.89 mV decade(-)) was lower than that of bare CP electrode (99.22 mV decade(-)). Owing to the improved current density, hydrogen recovery rate and low hydrogen evolution overpotential, the developed electrodeposited Ni on CP materials possessed much higher catalytic activity than bare CP. Thus, electrodeposited Ni on CP are promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction and low-cost cathode materials in MECs.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			1452-3981			WOS:000452568200062

Transition metal selenides, comprising earth abundant elements, such as Fe, Co and Cu, have gained attention as superior electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the alkaline medium. In this article, we have systematically investigated the evolution of OER catalytic activity as a function of composition for a series of Fe-Co-Cu quaternary selenides by exploring a trigonal phase diagram. The OER activity was dependent on the quantity of Cu and Fe in the Fe-Cu-Co-Se quaternary selenide electrocatalysts, while surprisingly, Fe-Cu ternary selenides exhibit reduced OER activity in comparison to their pure parent compounds FeSe and Cu3Se2. Quaternary selenides exhibited more efficient catalytic activity with increasing amount of Fe or Cu in the catalysts, and the quaternary mixed metal selenide thin film of composition (Fe0.48Co0.38Cu0.14)Se showed the best catalytic performance with a small overpotential of 256 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 40.8 mV dec(-1) in N-2 -saturated 1.0 M KOH solution. The outstanding catalytic performance of quaternary selenides may be explained by the possible electron cloud delocalization among the transition metal sites in the catalytic system through d-bands, leading to lower charge transport resistance at the catalyst-electrolyte interface as well better film conductivity, as has also been observed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Such enhanced charge transfers eventually facilitate the rate of O-2 release from the catalyst surface, leading to enhanced activity.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			2168-0485			WOS:000469304900057

Being an inverse spinel, magnetite will preferentially expose the octahedral sites and make metal cations available on the surface, which will play a conducive role in both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. We demonstrate that the partial substitution of Fe2+(either by Ni(2+)or Co(2+)ions) on the octahedral sites of the inverse spinel structure of Co(x)Ni((0.4-x))FeII0.6FeIII2O(4)significantly enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the magnetite samples in an alkaline medium. The spinel ferrite with the formula Co(0.2)Ni(0.2)FeII0.6FeIII2O(4)exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in 1 M KOH with the lowest onset overpotential (n(OER)= 190 andn(HER)= 200 mV), small overpotential at eta(10)(OER = 270 mV and HER = 275 mV), excellent kinetics (Tafel slopes,b(OER)= 44 mV dec(-1)andb(HER)= 99 mV dec(-1)), and high durability (>10 h). Furthermore, Co(0.2)Ni(0.2)FeII0.6FeIII2O(4)can serve as both cathode and anode for the overall water-splitting reaction, and delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a very low cell voltage of 1.72 V with excellent stability (>10 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). Thus, this work provides a lucid approach to engineer a highly efficient non-noble transition metal-based electrocatalyst for renewable energy applicationsviasimple micro-structural and surface engineering.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2398-4902			WOS:000552930600006

Meanwhile, Fe-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) showed a much better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2). At 120 and 240 degrees C, Fe-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2) and Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2) are synthesized, respectively, by the addition of Fe3+ into a hydrothermal solution immersed with nickel foam. The higher valence of Ni and Fe in the alpha-phase benefits the OER performance. In contrast to the alpha-phase case, the enrichment of the electron cloud around Fe in the beta-phase due to surrounding coordination environment is conducive to the HER, which can be verified consistently from XPS, XAFS, XANES and DFT. By taking Fe as the active sites, DFT calculations have confirmed that the energy barrier for each step of the HER is much lower than that corresponding to the Ni site. Only a 53.8 mV overpotential for Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)-240 is needed to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable with most of the active HER electrocatalysts. The electrolyzer cell employing Fe-doped beta-Ni(OH)(2)-240 as the cathode and Fe-doped alpha-Ni(OH)(2)-120 as the anode demonstrates superior performance for overall water splitting with excellent stability.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000518690900051

Here, a novel molecule-assisted strategy for synthesis of ultrasmall ruthenium oxide on nitrogen-doped carbon matrix catalyst (RuO2/N-C) is presented. 1,10-Phenanthroline molecular (Phen), which contains an abundant nitrogen element and can strongly coordinate with metal ions, is selected as the assistant to prepare RuO2/N-C. The space confinement effect in this process gives RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs) with size ca. 1.7 nm, making them ultraefficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. The resultant RuO2/N-C catalyst exhibits striking catalytic performances in strong alkaline solution, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 40 mV for HER and 280 mV for OER, respectively. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the excellent performances are due to the ultrasmall size of RuO2 NPs and the synergistic effect between RuO2 and N-C. More importantly, these RuO2/N-C composites can be utilized as bifunctional electrocatalysts as both anode and cathode and display superior water splitting activity to that of the commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts couple, suggesting the potential applications of our catalyst for large-scale H-2 and O-2 production in the future.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100048

Here, nanostructured CoP nanoparticles locked in hollow nitrogen doped carbon frameworks (CoP@HNC) were successfully designed and characterized for their morphology, composition, and electrochemistry. In a typical low-temperature phosphorization process, the Co species in carbonized poly-dopamine (PDA) coated ZIF-67 are converted to either hollow CoP or small-sized solid CoP nanoparticles governed by the nanoscale Kirkendall effect. The PDA layers derived nitrogen-doped carbon components feature a hollow polyhedral structure, with CoP nanoparticles imbedded in the shell. CoP@HNC demonstrates a low overpotential of 327 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) and a good operational stability (72 h) for alkaline OER. The HNC encapsulation affords the low electronic resistance between CoP nanoparticles, as well as the mechanical and chemical stability of composites by preventing the aggregation of CoP nanoparticles during the OER process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000692002500001

In this work, a facile continuous two-step hydrothermal method followed by electrodeposition to fabricate NiFe-LDH integrated with CoFe2O4@Co3S4 nanoflowers supported by carbon fiber paper (NiFe-CoFe2O4@Co3S4/CFP) as a full water-splitting electrocatalyst was developed.

Breakthroughs in low overpotential and stable anodic reactions are urgently needed to complement the rapid advancements in H-2 production. Using nickel (Ni)-based catalysts as an example, we intensified charge transfer on a nickel phosphide (Ni2P) anode for efficient H-2 production using substitution of contaminant degradation for the OER. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we confirmed that a decreased two-electron-transfer pathway was responsible for the superior formate oxidation, whereas the formation of the desired oxidation state of Ni-III accounted for the efficient urea degradation. Both scenarios were beneficial for accelerating charge transfer across the interface between the anode and electrolyte, thus achieving high H-2 production efficiency at low voltage. A voltage of only 1.40 V supported currents of 12.5 and 6.0 mA in urea- and formate-containing solutions, respectively, which reached 150 and 60 mA after the voltage was increased to 1.70 V, several times higher than that under basic conditions.									19	2	0	0	3	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437106300016

The activities of the fabricated electrodes toward the oxygen evolution reaction are evaluated. The loading amount and morphology of the IrO2 deposits are varied by controlling the electrodeposition potential (E-dep) and time (t(dep)). When electrodeposited at 0.7 V. the IrO2 loading ranges from 0.007 to 0.464 mg cm(-2) (t(dep): 1 similar to 30 min). In the PEMWE test at 90 degrees C, the IrO2/CP electrode with an IrO2 loading of 0.1 mg cm(-2) shows the highest performance (1.92 A cm(-2) at 1.8 V) in which high IrO2 utilization is achieved without significant exposure of the substrate carbon surface. The developed IrO2/CP electrodes provide cell performances comparable to those in previous reports with a higher IrO2 loading, indicating markedly enhanced mass activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These structures were synthesized in two steps, via hydrothermal and thermal reactions. FePO4 LBs were synthesized through thermal dehydrogenation of as-prepared FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O precursors (FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O. FePO4 + 2H(2)O), and p-Fe2P2O7 LBs were synthesized through thermochemical reduction of same precursors under an H-2 atmosphere (2FePO(4)center dot 2H(2)O + H-2 -> Fe2P2O7 + 5H(2)O). As an O-2-electrode electrocatalyst in Li-O-2 cells, p-Fe2P2O7 LBs exhibited a higher discharge capacity (30,000 mA h gcatalyst-1 at a current density of 500 mA g(catalyst)(-1)), higher reversibility (300 cycles at a current rate of 500 mA gcatalyst-1), and lower voltage gap, compared to FePO4 LBs. These superior performances of p-Fe2P2O7 LBs result from the Fe2+/Fe3+ redox effect and porous structure, which enhance the oxygen reduction or evolution reaction activities.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000532784800001

The optimized CeO2/alpha-MoC/beta-Mo2C MRs/CC electrode exhibits very low overpotentials of 22 and 29 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline freshwater and seawater, outperforming most of the reported molybdenum carbide-based electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, it could maintain long-term stability for over 100 h at a large current density of 1000 mA.cm(-2). Theoretical study and experimental results reveal that the synergistic effects of alpha-MoC, beta-Mo2C, and oxygen vacancy-rich CeO2 can effectively promote the dissociation of water molecules, tailor the d-band electronic structure of MoxC with a thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption free energy, increase the numbers of active sites, and facilitate the vectorial electron transfer, thus achieving an enhanced HER performance. The CeO2/alpha-MoC/beta-Mo2C MRs/CC electrode displays a potential large-scale application in hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000841965200001

However, even as benchmark catalysts in the acidic OER, Ru-based catalysts still suffer from sluggish kinetics owing to the scaling relationship that arises from the traditional concerted proton-electron transfer (CPET) process. Motivated by the knowledge that a charged surface may be favorable for accelerating the OER kinetics, we posited the incorporation of elements with pseudocapacitive properties into Ru-based catalysts. Herein, we report a RuPbOx electrocatalyst for efficient and stable water oxidation in acid with a low overpotential of 191 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). The combination of electrochemical analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and in situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that the improved OER kinetics was associated with the formation of superoxide precursors on the strongly charged surface after Pb incorporation, indicating a non-concerted proton-electron transfer mechanism for the OER on RuPbOx.

Now it is a big challenge for research community to produce green efficient hydrogen fuel in order to fulfil the demand of our daily need. Water splitting process is a highly recognized way of hydrogen production and storage. The fabrication of efficient electrocatalyst is highly desirable for water splitting application. Structure directing groups play an unique role in controlling the size, and morphology of nanoparticles which ultimately affects the efficiency. Here we report a cost-effective CoMoO4 electrocatalyst, which was synthesized by an easy chemical co-precipitation method in presence of organic polymeric surfactant K-30. It has a rod shape morphology. CoMoO4 electrocatalyst exhibits high OER activity with low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and low Tafel slope value, 75 mV/dec and stability of 10 h.

In this paper, we investigated water splitting in alkaline environments using skutterudite-type cobalt phosphide (CoP3) nanoneedle arrays fabricated on carbon cloth. A moderate amount of iron is doped into pristine CoP3, and the resulting Co1-xFexP3 shows a significant enhancement for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared with the pristine CoP3. Co0.7Fe0.3P3 displays the best HER performance, with an overpotential of 167 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) and a Tafel slope of 65.1 mV dec(-1). Co0.7Fe0.3P3 also shows the best OER catalytic performance, reaching a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) (eta(50)) at an overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE. Our results indicate that simple second metal element doping is an effective way to improve the HER and OER performance of skutterudite-type electrocatalysts in alkaline media. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Ni substitution yields multi-fold improvement in OWS over the pristine systems that are comparable to commercial Pt/C for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and better than IrO2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni-MoC@NGC champions in HER activity exhibiting an onset overpotential of 65 mV and current density of 140 mA/cm(2) at -370 mV (v RHE) in acidic media. An H2O electrolyzer constructed with Ni-MoC@NGC shows a comparable cell voltage to the Pt parallel to IrO2 pair and could split water aided by 1.5 V AAA commercial battery. First principle calculations and in-situ probing through quick-XAS during electrochemical processes provide valuable insights into how the adsorption energies of intermediates and reaction kinetics are modulated at different catalytic sites with the promotional electronic effect of Ni.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696918200002

The Co content of Co-doped SnS2 was facilely tuned by controlling the [Co]/[Sn] molar concentration ratio (SC-x; x = 0.05, 0.5, 1.0 2.0, where x indicates the [Co]/[Sn] ratio). The morphology of the samples did not significantly change despite changes in the Co dopant content. Compared to SC-0 (667 mV), SC-0.05 (400 mV), SC-0.5 (382 mV), and SC-1.0 (374 mV), SC-2.0 showed higher catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 323 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, SC-2.0 exhibited high stability for 12 h during chronopotentiometry. SC-2.0 was unexpectedly transformed to weakly crystallized CoOOH nanoparticles after the stability test. The transformation rate from Co-doped SnS2 to CoOOH was decreased with an increase in the Co content.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1567-1739	1878-1675		WOS:000858453800001

The origin of this enhanced performance toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied using a combination of a suite of structural, chemical, and mechanistic advanced characterization techniques including X-ray photoelectron (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), among others. We found that the reduction of the material is localized at the surface of the sample and that this effect creates effective n-type doping and a shift to more favorable energy band positions toward water oxidation. This thermodynamic effect, together with the change in sample morphology to larger and denser domains, results in an extended lifetime of the photogenerated carriers and improved charge extraction. In addition, the stability of the reduced sample in water was also confirmed. All of these effects result in a two-fold increase in the photocurrent density of the laser-treated samples.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000830808800001

Strains can be commonly introduced in SrTiO3 during the synthetic processes, for example, in pulsed laser deposition. However, the effect of the strains on the catalytic performance of OWS is still unclear to date. Herein, first-principles calculations were performed to evaluate the impact of biaxial strains applied in SrTiO3 (001) surface on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the bottleneck of OWS. It was found that the applied strains, especially the compressive strains, significantly affect the free energy changes for H2O dissociation and *OOH deprotonation of OER on SrTiO3 (001). More interestingly, the tensile strains reduce the surface energy and lower the OER overpotential through reducing the free energy change for the rate-determining step, i.e., the second step of OER (*OH deprotonation), while the compressive strains increase the surface energy and the OER overpotential. Consequently, it is probable to introduce the tensile strains in the synthetic process to enhance the OER performance on SrTiO3 (001) surface.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000729155800007

The composite powder with primary particle size ranging from 20 to 80 nm is co-synthesized via a simple citric-nitrate combustion method. X-ray diffraction examination confirms cubic fluorite YSB and rhombohedral perovskite LSM as the main phases in the composite. Temperature programmed O-2 desorption identifies remarkable low temperature desorption at 330 degrees C. Similarly, temperature programmed H-2 reduction reveals strong reduction at 385 degrees C. The facile oxygen evolution on YSB-LSM may result from the increased amount of oxygen vacancies and improved oxygen ion mobility. A cell employing YSB-LSM composite anode achieves current density of -1.52 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C and 1.28 V, 50% higher than conventional LSM-YSZ cell. Impedance results and analysis of distribution of relaxation times indicate that the rate-determining anode processes are effectively accelerated on YSB-LSM. The activation energy for oxygen evolution reaction on YSB-LSM is reduced to 0.65 eV, notably lower than on LSM-YSZ (1.29 eV). The high performance of YSB-LSM composite anode is attributed to the fast ion decorporation on YSB, the facile O-2 formation on LSM, and the abundant phase boundaries that facilitate the two processes.

However, the synthesis method of high-entropy compounds through the traditional heating approach is not conducive to the rapid properties screening, and the current elemental combinations of HEO are also highly limited.

High-entropy rocksalt oxides (HERSO) with the new elemental combination, high-entropy spinel oxides (HESO), and high-entropy perovskite oxide (HEPO) have been synthesized through the Joule-heating. The synthesized HERSO with new elemental combinations proves to be a great promotion of OER activity due to the synergy of multiple components and the continuous electronic structure experimentally and theoretically. The demonstrated synthesis approach and the new component combination of HERSO provide a broad platform for the development of high-entropy materials and catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000841165800001	35950973

However, OER activity of the catalyst decreases, when the skeleton structure of Fe-MOF-235 is destroyed after calcination. It is found that the outstanding OER performance of Fe-MOF-235 may be due to abundant active sites and faster charge transport kinetics afforded by the complete skeleton structure of Fe-MOF-235, and it also shows excellent stability during 70 h electrochemical testing. Therefore, Fe-MOF-235 can be directly used as an efficient OER catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000763577500003

Herein, a hierarchical bottom-up approach for fabricating TiO2 nanorod arrays with an Au nanolayer and Sn3O4 cocatalysts is demonstrated. The hierarchical Sn3O4/TiO2/Au photoanode exhibits a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 2.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE under AM 1.5G irradiation, which is about 5 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.5 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE). The significantly enhanced PEC properties are attributed to the spatial charge separation among Au nanolayer and Sn3O4 cocatalysts. More specifically, the bottom Au nanolayer can accelerate the electron transfer from TiO2 to fluorine doped tin dioxide (FTO) substrate, and the surface Sn3O4 nanoflakes can effectively capture holes and provide abundant active sites for oxygen-evolution reaction. These demonstrations may offer a new insight for rational design and construction of highly efficient TiO2-based PEC devices for solar water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2367-198X			WOS:000587022200001

The hybrid composite also exhibits excellent OER activity, achieving current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a lower over potential (eta) of 320 mV. The presence of Ni nanoparticles and porous sponge like structure of the composite is the main reason for this high performance.

The Fe dopant remarkably enhances the OER performance of Ni2P in alkaline medium through the electronic structure modulation of Ni. The (Fe0.5Ni0.5)(2)P/CC electrode, composed of uniform films coated on carbon fibers, delivers a low overpotential of 260 mV with a small Tafel slope of 45 mV.dec(-1) at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), outperforming most reported non-noble electrocatalysts and commercial RuO2 electrocatalyst. The (Fe0.5Ni0.5)(2)P/CC also displays superior electrochemical stability at high current density. An appropriate Fe dopant level facilitates the in situ transformation of Ni-Fe phosphides into active NiFeOOH during alkaline OER. This work simplifies the synthesis procedure of metal phosphides.

As the dissolution equilibrium is broken, the morphology of NiHPO4 transfers from solid nanowires to hollow nanotubes. The resulting 1D NiHPO4 nanotubes exhibit good electrocatalytic activity and stability in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Notably, a water-splitting voltage of 1.62 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is obtained in an electrolyzer setup assembled using 1D NiHPO4 nanotubes as cathode and anode, demonstrating NiHPO4 nanotubes are promising catalysts for overall water splitting. Moreover, the revealed mechanism of forming tube morphology can be extended to fabricate other metal phosphates with hollow structures.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000707657900004

Herein, inlaid on N-doped porous carbon frameworks, FeOx-Co3O4 solid solution undergoes a reconstruction process under the discharging process of the Zn-air battery test, evolving into a heterostructure with a functionalized surface. The functionalized surface consisting of in situ formed highly conductive metallic CoFe alloy and defect-rich structure is responsible for the reinforced conductivity and reactivity. Upon surface reconstruction, the self-promoted catalyst afforded by maintained electroactive FeO4-Co3O4 and functionalized surface boosts the electrocatalytic activity and Zn-air battery performance. A near 1.2-fold enlargement in peak power density is achieved, and the charge-discharge voltage gap gradually decreases from 1.18 to 1.04 V, accompanied with a steady cycle performance for 200 h. This self-promoted electrocatalyst can provide an important inspiration for rational engineering of electrocatalytic materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000800078600029

The improvement in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was observed on the surface of an electrode modified via the facile layer-by-layer assembly of polypyrrole (PPy), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and cucurbit[6]uril (Q[6]) in sequence. The electrochemical performance was evaluated, and the results indicate the remarkable activity of the proposed supramolecular electrocatalyst toward the OER in alkaline media. The morphology and chemical structure of the electrocatalyst were estimated before and after the OER process. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements suggested that a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 377 mV was achieved, which is very close to the value of IrO2 under the same conditions, and the calculated Tafel slope of 167 mV dec(-1) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results imply that a fast charge transfer occurs on the electrode with the functionalization of Q[6]. The developed catalyst could be considered as a potential alternative material for high-efficiency electrocatalytic OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000717131700001

In this work, a simple and efficient strategy including H2 bubbles-templating cathodic reduction and in situ electrooxidation was designed for the preparation of NiFeOOH/NiFe/Ni catalysts with laminar structure on Ni mesh (NM). As-prepared NiFeOOH/NiFe/Ni electrocatalyst for OER showed a small overpotential of 290 mV and 300 mV to achieve a current density of 500 and 1000 mA cm-2 in a three-electrode system, respectively. What's more, the water-alkali electrolyzer using NiFeOOH/NiFe/Ni as the anode and Ni/NM as the cathode can deliver 10 mA cm-2 at 1.52 V and steadily operate at 500 mA cm-2 for 100 h, suggesting the strategy given by this work is a promising pathway to achieve non-noble electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting at large current.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000674580200004

Herein, we develop a facile strategy using duck blood for the fabrication of plum-pudding-like FexNi1-xS2/C (FNS/C) composite with carbon as a conductive scaffold and FexNi1-xS2 as active sites. The resulting electrodes exhibited remarkable catalytic efficiency and stability for OER with a low overpotential of 248 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) along with a small Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media. The systematic experiments reveal that the enhanced performance is ascribed to the synergy of bimetal, reduced charge transfer resistance and the porous structure, and the sulfides were partially converted into oxyhydroxides during OER as the real active sites. Therefore, this work provides an intriguing solution to explore efficient, robust and inexpensive catalysts for practical generation of renewable fuels. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2D nanomaterials are characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and especially scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled to energy dispersive X-ray analysis and electron energy loss spectroscopy to assess the composition of the nanosheets and the oxidation state of the transition metal species. We show that the nanosheets preserve high oxidation states Co3+ and Co4+ of high interest for electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By combining high Co oxidation state, surface-to-volume ratio and optimized nickel substitution, the 2D nanomaterials produced in a simple way exhibit high OER electrocatalytic activity and stability in alkaline aqueous electrolyte comparable to standard materials obtained in harsh thermal conditions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000442186500017

Reported herein is a simple and versatile strategy to synthesize ultrathin Co3O4 and CoP NSs consisting of close-packed nanoparticles by pyrolyzing cobalt(II) phthalocyanine/graphene oxide (CoPc/GO) assemblies in air and subsequent topotactic phosphidation while preserving the graphene-like morphology. The strong pi-pi stacking interactions between CoPc and GO, and the inhibiting effect of the tetrapyrrole-derived macrocycle for grain growth during the catalytic carbon gasification contribute to the NSs forming. The resulting homologous Co3O4 and CoP NSs display outstanding catalytic activity in alkaline media toward the oxygen evolution reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, ascribed to the richly exposed active sites, and the expedited electrolyte/ion transmission path. The integrated asymmetrical two-electrode configuration also presents a superior cell voltage of 1.63 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, accompanied with the excellent durability during long-term cycling. Further evidences validate that this strategy is appropriate to fabricate graphene-like ultrathin NSs of many other metal oxides, such as Fe2O3, NiO, MoO3, and mixed-metal oxides, for various applications.									27	2	0	0	1	0	27			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000423834100012	29194945

Herein, for the first time, a nickel-chromium layered double hydroxide (NiCr-LDH) nanosheet array was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst towards overall water splitting. By tuning different Ni/Cr ratios of LDHs, the optimized Ni2Cr1-LDH shows extraordinary HER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 138 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), compared with all of the reported Ni-based LDHs (NiFe-LDH, NiCo-LDH, NiMn-LDH, NiTi-LDH, NiV-LDH etc.) and even outperforming Pt/C catalysts. The small overpotential of 319 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for the OER and outstanding durability at 1.55 V (vs. RHE) for 30 hours can also be achieved for Ni2Cr1-LDH. Notably, a two-electrode electrolyzer with a Ni2Cr1-LDH bifunctional electrocatalyst as both the anode and the cathode can work for at least 30 hours with a cell voltage of merely 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Both experimental and density functional theoretical calculations show that the Cr3+ ions within the LDH layer serve as charge transfer sites and thus effectively boost the intrinsic electrochemical activity. Therefore, this work provides a new NiCr-LDH system as a more efficient metal hydroxide for bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst.									122	3	0	0	6	0	122			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000448663400026	30318542

One dimensional NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanostructures were prepared by using a simple electrospinning technique with two different metal precursors (metal nitrate/PAN and metal acetylacetonate/PAN). The effect of precursor concentration on the morphologies was investigated. Single-phase, NCO with an average diameter of 100 nm, porous interconnected fibrous morphology was revealed by FESEM and FETEM analysis. The hierarchical nanostructured 1D-spinel NiCo2O4 materials showed a remarkable electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction and evolution in an aqueous alkaline medium. The extraordinary bi-functional catalytic activity towards both ORR and OER was observed by the low over potential (0.84 V), which is better than that of noble metal catalysts [Pt/C (1.16 V), Ru/C (1.01 V) and Ir/C (0.92 V)], making them promising cathode materials for metal-air batteries. Furthermore, the rechargeable zinc-air battery with NCO-A(1) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst displays high activity and stability during battery discharge, charge, and cycling processes.									313	17	0	0	13	0	321			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000332604200023	24496578

Iridium catalyst is expensive, and it is important to minimize its use and to optimize interface between Ir and ionomer or water for higher utilization of catalyst in oxygen evolution reaction. In this paper, x-ray computed tomography along with electrochemical and modeling techniques are used to characterize the interface for two different porous transport layers (PTLs) and catalyst layers at various loadings. We show that low porosity sintered PTLs exhibit higher interfacial contact with the catalyst and the membrane that results in improved kinetics. Radiography and modeling results indicate that oxygen taking multiple transport pathways through the PTL results in slug flow through the channels that reduces mass transport overpotential. Based on the results, we suggest design guidelines for high efficiency and durable PEMWE and their components.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787894400001

Herein, a novel jellyfish-like Mott-Schottky-type electrocatalyst is developed to realize fast electron transfer and decipher the structure-mass transport connection during ORR process. Both spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculation demonstrate electrons spontaneously transfer from Fe to N-doped graphited carbon at the heterojunction interface, thus accelerating electron transfer from electrode to reactant. Dynamic analysis indicates unique structure can significantly improve mass transport of oxygen-species due to two factors: one is electrolyte streaming effect caused by tentacle-like carbon nanotubes; the other is effective collision probability in the semi-closed cavity. Therefore, this Mott-Schottky-type catalyst delievers superior ORR performance with high onset potential, positive half wave potential, and large current density. It also exhibits low overpotential when serving as an air cathode in Zn-air batteries. This work deepens understanding of the two key factors-electron transfer and mass transport-on determining the kinetic reaction of ORR process and offers a new avenue in constructing efficient Mott-Schottky electrocatalysts.									96	2	0	0	9	0	96			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000526825100037

Pure Fe (oxy)hydroxides, however, are typically thought to be poor OER catalysts and are not well-understood. Here, we report a systematic investigation of Fe (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysis in alkaline media. At low overpotentials of 350 mV, the catalyst dissolution rate is low, the activity is dramatically enhanced by an AuOx/Au substrate, and the geometric OER current density is largely independent of mass loading. At higher overpotentials of similar to 450 mV, the dissolution rate is high, the activity is largely independent of substrate choice, and the geometric current density depends linearly on loading. These observations, along with previously reported in situ conductivity measurements, suggest a new model for OER catalysis on Fe (oxy)hydroxide. At low overpotentials, only the first monolayer of the electrolyte-permeable Fe (oxy)hydroxide, which is in direct contact with the conductive support, is OER-active due to electrical conductivity limitations. On Au substrates, Fe cations interact with AuOx after redox cycling, leading to enhanced intrinsic activity over FeOOH on Pt substrates. At higher overpotentials, the conductivity of Fe (oxy)hydroxide increases, leading to a larger fraction of the electrolyte-permeable catalyst film participating in catalysis. Comparing the apparent activity of the putative Fe active sites in/on different hosts/surfaces supports a possible connection between OER activity and local structure.									310	14	0	0	13	0	313			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000366223200021

Herein we report that incorporation of fluorine into a cobalt phosphide alloy has a unique effect: it creates both F- anion doping and P vacancies, resulting in a nearly 15-fold enhancement of the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in neutral solution. The existence of dual defects in CoP was confirmed by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) curve fitting results and density functional theory calculations. We show that the dual-defect feature is beneficial for increasing the active-site exposure, tuning the surface wettability, and optimizing the electronic configuration of CoP for the HER.

Therefore, it is a need of time to replace fossil fuels with any other source with huge reservoirs. Herein, we fabricated a PbS/ SrZrO3 nanocomposite, exhibiting promising oxygen evolution reaction activity. The synthesized samples were characterized by various techniques to confirm the material phase, morphology, surface area, composition, and oxidation states. As a result, it displays a very promising overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a lower Tafel slope of 64 mV/dec, a higher turnover frequency of 1.45 s-1, an electrochemically active surface area of 280 cm2/g, and high stability up to 24 h, in contrast to the most advanced noble metal electrocatalysts Pt, oxides of Ir and Ru, and their constituents. High activity and low cost make this material one of the best to endeavor in the field of water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000867750400001		
J	Jang, Hansaem; Lee, Jeong-Hyeon; Lee, Jeon Ryang; Kim, Tae-Won								Metal-Support Interaction Can Deactivate IrOx/Sb:SnO2 OER Catalysts in Polyol Process								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				5	8			9297	9302		10.1021/acsaem.2c01765				AUG 22 2022	2022	Only a few materials can remain undissolved under working conditions for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, which limits the choice of catalysts and supports. One of the practical catalyst/support candidates is IrOx/Sb:SnO2 (Ir/ATO) because both components are thermodynamically stable under low-pH anodic conditions. Moreover, between Ir and ATO, a strong metal- support interaction is present, thereby allowing for long-lasting OER activity unless the support degrades. However, we demonstrate that the strong interaction can paradoxically deactivate Ir/ATO structures when synthesizing them using the polyol process. We reveal that the strong interaction in the presence of polyol at elevated temperatures can cause the reduction of the Sb dopant to zero-valency. Findings show that the varied oxidation state of the dopant decreases the electrical conductivity of the Ir/ATO, impeding the electron transfer through the support, hence deteriorating electrocatalytic activity toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000874834600001

The results showed that an IrO2-SnO2 solid solution was formed, and the electrode surface was relatively compact. The doping of IrO2 could significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode for OER The electrode modified with only 5 mol % Ir met the needs of acidic water electrolysis. Meanwhile, the performances of the electrode approached that of Ti/IrO2 when Ir content was only 8 mol %, which resulted from the fact that IrO2 doping improved the chemical stability as well as the electrocatalytic activity of the electrode. Moreover, the deactivation behavior of the electrode was investigated as well. It was mainly ascribed to the chemical composition and morphology change induced by continuous dissolution of the metal oxides, which eventually led to the passivation of the Ti substrate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000840747700001

In this work, a controlled in situ partial transformation strategy through a two-step hydrothermal reaction was developed for the successful synthesis of a novel Fe-Ni(OH)(2)@Ni-BDC/CFC (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid and CFC represents carbon fiber cloth) composite nanosheets. The as-obtained Fe-Ni(OH)(2)@Ni-BDC/CFC demonstrated improved electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to pristine Fe-Ni(OH)(2)/CFC or Ni-BDC/CFC under alkaline condition. Owing to the coordination effect of the BDC ligand and strong electronic interaction in the distinct chemical composite, metal cations in the composite catalyst hold a higher oxidation state, which will significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. Thus, the strategy illustrated here is anticipated to provide a new opportunity for synthesizing composite electrocatalysts that are difficult to synthesize via conventional methods.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000620282700006

The well-dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles on rGO sheets were obtained without a reducing agent. X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopies indicated the reduction of graphene oxide (GO) under microwave conditions, and the microscopy images revealed the successful formation of nanocomposites. In addition, double band gap values (E-gap = 2.39 and 3.37 eV) for the 16rGO-TiO2 nanocomposite were observed. The heterostructure presented a higher electrocatalytic performance for water oxidation under neutral and alkaline conditions, when compared to pure TiO2 nanoparticles, and long-term current stability. The electrochemical characterization showed that the rGO-TiO2 nanocomposites presented efficient charge separation, as demonstrated by photoluminescence spectra, which was related to the high electronic transfer between TiO2 nanoparticles and rGO sheets. This work provided new insights into the development of high performance and cost-effective rGO-TiO2 electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000532252100016

However, the electrocatalytic property of ST film for water oxidation, especially combined with TiO2 photoanode, is seldom investigated. In this paper, we report a one-step sputtering strategy to synthesize ST film electrocatalysts on TiO2 film in order to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. Compared to pristine TiO2 electrode, the ST modified electrode achieved a largely enhanced PEC performance. Such enhancement could be manipulated in an optimal manner when the ST film thickness was further varied, where the 80 nm ST modified TiO2 (ST-80-TiO2) showed the lowest overpotential of 132 mV, with the highest photocurrent density enhancements of nearly 18-fold and 11-fold under dark and simulated sunlight illumination, respectively. This facile and effective decoration approach makes it possible to design ST electrocatalyst-semiconductor structures for other general photoanode improvements. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, all-in-one (working as solvent, template and reactant precursor) deep eutectic solvent is rarely reported for the construction of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, the DES formed by cobalt salt and urea was used as an all-in-one platform for the construction of two-dimensional (2D) [Co-(NH3) 4CO3]Cl nanosheets. After activation process, the 2D [Co(NH3)(4)CO3] Cl nanosheets could convert to amorphous CoOOH, resulting in good catalytic performance (outperforming most of the state-of-the-art catalysts) with 291 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a satisfied Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, the long-term stability results indicate its good durability for OER The present all-in-one DES strategy toward OER catalysts might open the door for rational design of advanced catalysts from sustainable way.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			2168-0485			WOS:000467351200101

The best known such electrode is the fluidized-bed electrode (FBE) that, despite early promise, has found only limited application in the deposition of metals from solution. The novel SBE is a cathode where copper is deposited at a high-current density in a slowly moving bed of copper particles. The article describes an investigation at the University of California, Berkeley into the spouted-bed electrowinning of copper. The effect of operational variables on copper deposition, from electrolytes similar to those encountered in conventional copper electrowinning, onto a spouted-bed cathode have been examined. Anodic reactions used to obtain the results in this part of the article have been the evolution of oxygen on a DSA* anode and the oxidation of a copper matte. A third anodic reaction*DSA is a trademark of Eltech Corp., Chardon, Ohio.is treated in Part II. Despite a high-current density, the electrical-energy consumption was equal to or lower than that in conventional electrowinning.									22	1	0	0	1	1	23			1073-5615			WOS:000178461800003

The experimental results indicated that the lowest decomposition voltage of chloride ion was obtained on RuO2 anode and the highest decomposition voltage of oxygen evolution was found on SPR (SnO2-PdO-RuO2-TiO2). The side reaction (oxygen evolution) on SPR was effectively inhibited. The Tafel slope and exchange current density of the anodic oxidation of chloride ion on SPR were 46 mV and 1.95 mA cm-2, respectively. Using SPR as anodes, the catalytic area was evaluated as 44.6 mC cm-2. The current efficiency of degradation of formaldehyde was 69.8% when 1,500 C was charged into the reaction system and the initial concentration of formaldehyde was 3,000 ppm. The degradation fraction of benzaldehyde was 70.0% when the applied electricity and initial concentration of benzaldehyde were 3,500 C and 800 ppm.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0368-1653			WOS:A1994PE42500004

Here, we report that the light-driven hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 0.5 mol % Rh-doped rutile increases by more than 30 times compared with that of rutile when ascorbic acid is used as a sacrificial agent. Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and surface photovoltage spectroscopy are employed to reveal the impact of surface states on the photo-oxidation reactions. It is found that the adsorption of ascorbic acid molecules dramatically reduces the activity of rutile due to coverage of the HER-active Ti sites. Nevertheless, for Rh-doped rutile, ascorbic acid neutralizes the Rh(IV) sites that would otherwise cause severe recombination of electron-hole pairs and resurrects its photocatalytic performance. This work demonstrates the key role of interfacial chemistry in photocatalytic reactions and provides a strategy for excavating the potential of various photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000832417200001	35860844

A facile two-step method, mild acid oxidation followed by air calcination that directly activates commercial carbon cloth (CC) to generate uniform nanoporous and super hydrophilic surface structures with optimized oxygen-rich functional groups and an enhanced surface area, is presented here. Impressively, this two-step activated CC (CC-AC) exhibits superior oxygen electrocatalytic activity and durability, outperforming the oxygen-doped carbon materials reported to date. Especially, CC-AC delivers an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, which is among the best performances of metal-free OER electrocatalysts. The practical application of CC-AC is presented via its use as an FAE in a flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery. The bendable battery achieves a high open circuit voltage of 1.37 V, a remarkable peak power density of 52.3 mW cm(-3) at 77.5 mA cm(-3), good cycling performance with a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.98 V and high flexibility.

Currently, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode is a bottleneck limiting the acidic water splitting. Here, we report that the OER activity of Ir, one of the most commonly used OER catalysts, can be boosted by forming phase boundaries with Au. Mixed Au and Ir catalysts were synthesized on carbon paper electrodes, which underwent structural evolution under the OER environment to form an Au-Ir interface-rich structure. Compared with Ir catalyst, which requires an overpotential of similar to 393 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, the evolved Au-Ir catalyst shows a lower overpotential at similar to 351 mV. X-ray photoelectronic spectrum (XPS) study, in conjunction with electrochemical analysis on the surface-site-normalized activity, reveals that the improved OER performance is due to the presence of Au/Ir interfaces in the catalysts. In addition to Ir, the strategy of accelerating OER via Au/Ir interfaces has been further applied to IrCo, IrNi, and IrCu alloy catalysts. With the broad applicability of the strategy demonstrated, this study opens a new route to design OER catalysts for efficient acidic water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2639-4979		WOS:000705377400002

The partial pressures of ethylbenzene and oxygen were varied and rates were measured for the formation of styrene. Kinetics studies reveal that the mechanism of the reaction is of the "Mars Van Krevelen Redox" type. The rate equation deduced, assuming a steady state involving a two stage oxidation-reduction process, represented the data most satisfactorily. The catalyst has been synthesized by a method similar to a solution combustion method and characterized using FT-Raman and powder XRD methods. DFT level computational studies provided a deep insight for the reaction mechanism at the molecular level. According to our calculations ethylbenzene first dissociatively adsorbs over the catalyst and produces an ethylbenzene radical which subsequently adsorbs on the vanadyl group or bridging oxygen V-O-V or bridging oxygen V-O-Ti. The adsorbed radical further loses an H atom to produce styrene. The catalyst is regenerated by molecular oxygen.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2046-2069			WOS:000354211100001

We found that the beneficial effect of Mo/W doping on bismuth vanadate stems from structural surface re-organizations with the formation of a peculiar site (Biopp), which stabilizes both hydration and catalytic capabilities. Water adsorption is more favourable on Biopp site rather than on top of the dopant Mo/W atoms. Also, the catalytic performances for OER are significantly improved at Biopp site thanks to a stabilization of the crucial intermediate along the OER mechanism. Therefore, the Mo/W dopants exert a non-innocent indirect effect on the catalysis by activating the under-coordinated Biopp site via a long-range pull-back mechanism. These findings pave the route to new design strategies based on doping and defect engineering to push further the development of new photocatalysts for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-8231			WOS:000737631400005

Here, we adopted Ar-plasma to engrave a cobalt oxide with abundant oxygen vacancies (denoted as Co3O4-x). The introduction of oxygen vacancies to cobalt oxide not only promotes its reversible Co-O <-> Co-O-OH redox reaction but also leads to good oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution (ORR/OER) performance (a half-wave potential of 0.84 V, four-electron transfer process for ORR, and 330 mV overpotential, 58 mV.dec(-1) Tafel slope for OER). We then constructed a battery system based on both Zn-Co3O4-x, and Zn-air electrochemical reactions. The hybrid battery reveals both a high-power density of 3200 W.kg(-1) and high-energy density of 1060 Wh.kg(-1). Furthermore, the developed flexible solid-state hybrid batterydemonstrates good waterproof and washable ability (99.2% capacity retention of after 20 h water soaking test and 93.2% capacity retention after 1 h washing test). Interestingly, the fabricated flexible battery can work under water, and after the power is exhausted, the battery can automatically recover electricity output as long as it is exposed to air. The developed device is suitable for wearable applications considering its electrochemical performances, great environmental adaptation, and "air recoverability". In addition, this study underscores the approach to develop hybrid energy-storage technologies through modification of electrode materials.									184	10	0	0	9	0	185			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000443525600113	30040383

Highest photoresponse was obtained for the n-TiO2 films prepared at 850 degrees C for 13 min. The maximum photocurrent density of 2.6 mA cm(-2) was obtained in the absence of external potential at light intensity of 50 mW cm(-2) in the self-driven cell. This current density represents 10.86 liters of H-2 production per hour per square meter of the surface of the electrode and 1.6% maximum photoconversion efficiency to H, gas. AC impedance characterization of the n-TiO2 films were made in a one compartment cell in the absence of illumination. A single intercept of Mott-Schottky plot (which was used to determine the flat band potential) was observed for n-TiO2 Samples below AC frequency of 2500 Hz. A discrepancy of the flatband potential obtained from the Mott-Schottky plot (-1.13 V/SCE) and the j(p)(2)-V plot (-0.97 V/SCE) was observed. The built-in band bending was found to be 0.16 V for n-TiO2.

The photocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution from water was investigated while Fe3+ as electron acceptor. The results show that 0.05% Y3+ dopant can make the optic response range of WO3 catalysts expand to the visual light obviously. The analytical results of XPS indicate that Y3+-doping can increase the density of the surface oxygen vacancies of catalysts. In the experiment of water splitting to oxygen at the visible radiation, the rate of oxygen evolution for 0.05% Y3+ doped WO3 is 161.3 mumol/(L.h), which is 1.7 times of that of pure WO3.									1	2	0		0	0	2			1004-0609			INSPEC:10238169

Herein, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles are electrodeposited upon hydrothermally grown NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) on nickel foam for pursuing improved electrocatalysis bifunctionality. The introduced Pd induces more active sites, strong electric interaction, and enhanced charge transfer, thus leading to substantially improved catalytic activity for water electrolysis. The optimal Pd-NiFe LDH exhibits impressive catalytic activity, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 156 mV for the OER and 130 mV for the HER, respectively. The two-electrode electrolyzer assembled with Pd-NiFe LDH achieves an ultralow cell potential of 1.514 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, superior to those of most of the previous bifunctional electrocatalysts in alkaline media. This study may offer a promising solution to simultaneously improve the intrinsic activity, site density, and charge transfer of transition metal electrocatalysts with the help of trace amounts of noble metal.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31				2052-1537		WOS:000466945800010

The removal of adsorbed oxygen from the catalytic site is essential to maintain the long-term activity and selectivity of the carbide catalysts in the deoxygenation process related to bio-oil stabilization and upgrading. In this contribution, the computed reaction energetics and reaction barriers of O* removal were compared among undoped and Ni-doped Mo2C(001) surfaces. The DFT calculations indicate that selected Ni-doped surfaces such as Ni adsorbed on T-Mo and Tc Mo2C(001) surfaces enable weaker binding of important reactive intermediates (O*, OH*) compared to the undoped counterparts, which is beneficial for the O* removal from the catalyst surface. This study thus confirms the promoting effect of the Ni dopant on O* removal reaction on the T-Mo Mo2C(001) and Tc Mo2C(001) surfaces. This computational prediction has been confirmed by the temperature-programmed reduction profiles of Mo2C and Ni-doped Mo2C catalysts, which had been passivated and stored in an oxygen environment.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000423652700017

Herein, we report the synthesis and electrocatalytic performance of mesoporous nanostructured spinel-type MFe2O4 (M = Co, Mn, Ni) oxides which can serve as alternative low-cost bi-functional electrocatalysts for ORR/OER. Loaded on XC-72 carbon support, the MFe2O4 spinel oxides show the M-dependent catalytic activities with CoFe2O4 being the most active electrocatalyst followed by MnFe2O4 and NiFe2O4 for ORR. For the OER, however, the activity increases in the order: MnFe2O4 < NiFe2O4 approximate to CoFe2O4. Additionally, the CoFe2O4 catalyst shows the smallest overpotential between ORR and OER. Compared with commercial IrO2, the MFe2O4 catalysts reveal comparable OER activities. Furthermore, the MFe2O4 catalysts exhibit much better methanol tolerance and stability than Pt/C. Meanwhile, both electrochemical measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations verify that the ORRs on the MFe2O4 catalysts are a direct 4 e- pathway in the alkaline solution, and expound the reason for the excellent methanol tolerance of MFe2O4.

Herein, the nanostructured binary transition metal oxides NiFeOx and CoFeOx, loaded through magnetron sputtering deposition, were employed as cocatalysts for Fe2TiO5 nanoparticles, applied to the oxygen production from solar water splitting. After the coverage of Fe2TiO5 with exceptionally small CoFeOx and NiFeOx nanoparticles, the O-2 evolution boosted from 7.0 (pure Fe2TiO5) to 56.0 and 63.0 mu mol, respectively, under visible light irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, these performance enhancements are the highest reported for the particulate Fe2TiO5 photocatalyst, so far. The improvements result from the alleviation of charge transfer resistance at the solid/liquid interface, as the binary metal oxides aid the charge carriers separation at the heterojunctions and improve the kinetics of the water oxidation reaction.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2199-692X			WOS:000761154700001

However, most OER precatalysts undergo slow or incomplete self-reconstructions to generate real active sites, which is a time-consuming process for achieving high OER performance. Thus, we report a new class of OER precatalysts that can achieve highly active OER species by a rapid and deep self-reconstruction (denoted by SELF-RECON). The precatalysts with a core-shell structure comprising NiMoO4 (core) and NiFe/Ni-FeOx nanoparticles in N-doped amorphous carbons (shell) (denoted by NiMoFeO@NC), can realize rapid MoO42- dissolution and fast formation of NiOOH with Fe incorporation simultaneously. In situ Raman spectroscopy together with electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electrochemical tests indicate that the obtained NiFeOOH/NiFe-LDH after SELF-RECON behave as the real active species that outperform NiMoFeO@NC, with ultra-low overpotentials and extraordinary long-term stability.									95	6	0	0	5	0	96			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000598228500010

These devices are mainly limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, efficient catalysts in acidic media that allow operating at low overpotential are necessary. Ir-based nanoparticles are both active and stable for the OER. Surfactants are widely used in the preparation of nanoparticle colloids. A severe drawback for catalysis is the need to remove surfactants by typically costly, hazardous, time and/or energy consuming steps. Herein we present a modified approach of the polyol synthesis that consists of a simple surfactant-free and NaOH-free synthesis of Ir nanoparticles in ethylene glycol leading to colloidal nanoparticles of ca. 2.5 nm in diameter. The benefits and drawbacks of the surfactant-free synthesis are illustrated by comparison with commercial Ir black nanoparticles and Ir nanoparticles obtained using surfactant for the electrocatalytic OER in acidic media.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000505915200001

As has been well reported, nitrogen-doped carbons are efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their ability to adsorb hydrogen ions, to combine them and to release H<INF>2</INF>. The introduction of other heteroatoms to disturb the successive HER active sites in nitrogen-doped carbon, and to offer binding sites for N<INF>2</INF>, is beneficial for efficiently catalyzing the NRR. Here, we rationally synthesize boron, nitrogen and fluorine ternary-doped carbon (BNFC) from the carbonization of cigarette butts saturated with the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (C<INF>8</INF>H<INF>15</INF>N<INF>2</INF>BF<INF>4</INF>). Nitrogen atoms in BNFC are capable of adsorption of hydrogen ions, and the adjacent B or F heteroatoms offer Lewis acid sites for chemisorption of N<INF>2</INF>; in the case of this synergistic catalysis, a boosted electrocatalytic activity toward the NRR with an NH<INF>3</INF> yield rate of 41 mu g<INF>NH<INF>3</INF></INF> h<SUP>-1</SUP> mg<INF>cat.</INF><SUP>-1</SUP> and a faradaic efficiency as high as 14% at -0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) are recorded for BNFC in 0.05 M H<INF>2</INF>SO<INF>4</INF> electrolyte. Moreover, a comparably high NH<INF>3</INF> yield rate (39 mu g<INF>NH<INF>3</INF></INF> h<SUP>-1</SUP> mg<INF>cat.</INF><SUP>-1</SUP>) and faradaic efficiency (16%) at -0.4 V vs. RHE are also recorded in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte due to the capability of water dissociation and adsorption of generated hydrogen ions by the nitrogen atoms in BNFC. In addition, due to the modulated electronic structure of the carbon atoms by means of heteroatom doping, BNFC also exhibits a Pt-like oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a half-wave potential of 836 mV vs. RHE and superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) demanding a low overpotential of 313 mV to achieve 10 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. As a consequence, the assembled rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs) perform at a 1.8-fold higher power density than commercial Pt/C-IrO<INF>2</INF> and sustain this for 2300 cycles with minimal degradation in performance. The battery performance of all-solid-sate ZABs also outperforms that of commercial Pt/C-IrO<INF>2</INF> systems and can power the OER-NRR coupled device to electrochemically generate NH<INF>3</INF>.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000533422400023

Here, we propose that the already-synthesized organometallic lattice (Ni-3(CNH)(12)) concurrently hosts topological and catalytic properties. Using first-principles calculations combined with tight-binding (TB) model, we demonstrate that the 2D Ni-3(CNH)(12) intrinsically possesses multiple Dirac cones along with flat bands passing through the Dirac bands. Taking the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) into account, all the degenerate points open gaps, spawning abundant topologically nontrivial insulating phases characterized by a nonzero Z(2) topological invariant and edge states. Furthermore, because of its special geometry and electronic states, the 2D lattice can serve as a bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting with low overpotentials. Our current results offer a viable approach for the discovery of 2D organometallic materials with multifunctional application in spintronics devices and catalysts from the emerging field of topological materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900085

Room temperature NaOH-precipitated NiO showed the highest activity and stability towards methanol oxidation in hydroxide (0.005 M KOH) and carbonate (0.1 M Na(2)CO(3)) media of similar alkalinity. Rapid degradation of NiO electrodes was attributed to microcracking and disintegration associated with the formation of the gamma-NiOOH/alpha-Ni(OH)(2) redox couple, in addition to repeated scans through the oxygen evolution reaction region. Carbonate electrolytes also exhibited average current ranges 3-4 times higher and charge transfer resistances around 85% lower than hydroxide electrolytes. This suggests carbonate may provide a better medium in terms of higher activity and more moderate alkalinity for electrochemical reactions than hydroxide solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This principle has been applied to derive a far-from-equilibrium 'self-organized' mechanism of electron transfer as well as a synergetic multi-electron transfer. A key requirement is the functioning of feedback loops within the macromolecules or their environment, which can transfer small amounts of energy required for self-organization. Possible macromolecular mechanisms are discussed, by which an active friction force can be exerted on electrons during transfer. A possible active role of intervening protein structure in contrast to the passive role discussed for conventional distant donor acceptor coupling is investigated. Evidence for self-organized electron transfer in photosynthetic structures is discussed. The last step in oxygen evolution is considered to be a synergetic multi-electron transfer reaction, with oscillating behavior being a consequence of it. Quasi-symmetric molecular geometries (reaction centers, manganese complex) are considered as mechanistically essential elements facilitating symmetry breaking mechanisms.

The S-33(p,gamma)Cl-34 reaction influences this ratio directly by destroying S-33 in novae. Additionally, beta-delayed gamma rays from the metastable state of Cl-34 (t(1/2) = 32 min) have been suggested to be potential nova observables.

Rhombohedral (MoS2) and hexagonal (CoS and CuS) structures of the electrocatalysts were identified from the X-ray diffraction patterns. Raman-active modes confirmed the characteristic phonon vibrations. The prepared sulphides optical studies were examined employing photoluminescence spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy. Morphological variations observed for different sulphide nanostructures were confirmed by the scanning electron microscopy images. A comparative electrochemical study of MoS2, CoS and CuS was performed. Of the three candidates, MoS2 has superior capacitive behaviour, exhibiting very high specific capacitance of 513F/g at 0.5 A/g, and moreover exhibited the highest oxygen evolution reaction current density of 442.7 mA/g at a scan rate of 10 mV/s. Furthermore, it maintained its performance for longer in 1000 cycles of galvanostatic charging and discharging and in 12h of an oxygen evolution reaction stability test.									24	1	0	0	0	0	25			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000510080700026

However, such composites at certain fractional values of dopants realize the substitution limit because of lattice mismatch. Here, on the basis of density functional theory studies and experimentation, we demonstrate codoping as an effective approach to overcome this result with an outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Nickel and cobalt as the case dopants for the host structure IrO2 atomically substituted 5090 of the precious metal. As a new structural insight, the decreased crystal energy was determined to be the key factor for considerable insertion of dopants. Furthermore, the synthesized codoped IrO2 reflected an overpotential of only 285 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), which is appreciably lower than the 320 and 330 mV for individually doping cobalt and nickel, respectively. Our presented approach suggests further OER optimization methods with extensive reduction of precious metals.									60	1	0	0	3	0	60			2380-8195			WOS:000417888400021

As an example, DPPDs are presented for the comparison of electrocatalysts for water oxidation, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an important electrochemical reaction because of its key role in energy conversion devices and biological systems (water electrolyses, photoelectrochemical water splitting, plant photosynthesis). The criteria for obtaining kinetic data are discussed and a 3-D diagram, which shows the heterogeneous electron transfer kinetics of an electrochemical system as a function of pH and applied potential is presented. DPPDs are given for four catalysts: IrO2, Co3O4, Co3O4 electrodeposited in a phosphate medium (Co-Pi) and Pt, allowing a direct comparison of the activity of different electrode materials over a broad range of experimental conditions (pH, potential, current density). In addition, the experimental setup and the factors affecting the accurate collection and presentation of data (e. g., reference electrode system, correction of ohmic drops, bubble formation) are discussed.									168	3	0	0	20	0	168			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000297473200030

Here, for the first time, we reported a novel ultrathin carbon layer coated mesoporous Ni-NiFe2O4 (Ni-NiFe2O4@C) nanosheet arrays catalyst by hydrothermal growth of NiFe-precursor on carbon cloth followed by a thermal decomposition process. The resultant Ni-NiFe2O4@C catalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic performances toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolyte, which requires overpotential of 212 mV for OER and 217 mV for HER to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with Tafel slope of 51 and 96 mV dec(-1), respectively. Moreover, the two-electrode electrolyzer made of Ni-Fe2O4@C electrodes requires a cell voltage of 1.57 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with long-term stability, which is superior to that of RuO2//Pt/C electrolyzer.

In this work, three composites of metal cobalt nanoparticles highly dispersed in N-doped carbon materials were facilely constructed by pyrolysis of different phenylenediamine based Schiff base-Co complexes (PDBs). Interestingly, the composites derived from PDBs based on different phenylenediamine exhibited different morphologies. The superior case is that rodlike composite catalyst was derived from o-phenylenediamine based PDBs. The obtained catalyst exhibited remarkable performances for both cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as overall water electrolysis. Only 172 and 289 mV of overpotentials and 1.57 V of cell voltage were exhibited at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, OER and water splitting in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. The catalyst also displayed robust stability and high Faraday efficiency, and thus are potential high-performance catalyst for commercial water electrolysis.

The obtained composite ZIF-L@Fe-28 (120 mg) affords the best oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and stability with an overpotential of 312 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), compared with ZIF-L@Fe-28 (80, 160 mg), ZIF-67@Fe-28, the pristine 2D ZIF-L and 3D ZIF-67. These controls suggest that the superior performance is attributable to the {Fe-28} <-> ZIF bidirectional synergistic effect and the etching effect of {Fe-28} in aqueous solution on the ZIF-L. Therefore, we propose that the strategy of preparing ZIF composites loaded with polynuclear metal-oxo clusters fully composed of OER-active metal sites (Fe, Co and Ni) may open up new avenues for the design of novel non-noble electrocatalysts for the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000801028300001

The Hubbard U is the cornputationally cheapest addition one can use to capture correct reaction energies, but the specific Hubbard U oftentimes m-uSt.be empirically determined only when suitable experimental data exist. We evaluated the effect of addling a calculated, linear response U on the predicted adsorption energies, scaling relationships, and activity trends with respect to the oxygen evolution reaction for a set of transition metal dioxides. We find that applying a U greater than zero always causes adsorption energies to be more endothermic. Furthermore, the addition of the Hubbard U greater than zero does not break scaling relationships established without the Hubbard U. The addition of the calculated linear response U value produces shifts of different systems along the activity volcano that results in improved activity trends when compared with experimental results.									71	1	0	0	4	0	72			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000350840700042

Here, we show how the incorporation of nickel into nanoscale dicobalt boride results in an improvement of the activity and stability of the catalyst in alkaline electrolytes. The borides are obtained by a one-step solution synthesis, calcined, and characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. For(Co1-xNix)(2)B (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5), (Co0.9Ni0.1)(2)B shows the best performance with an overpotential of eta=371 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Normalization to the electrochemical surface area shows a clear dependence on the activity with rising nickel content. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the catalyst is modified under reaction conditions and indicates that CoOOH and Ni(OH)(2) are formed as active surface species. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (F-AAS) measurements show that no cobalt is dissolved during the electrochemical investigations, but the nickel concentration is increased on the surface of the catalyst as follows from XPS measurements after the electrochemical investigation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000631166000001

The electrocatalysts, containing variable contents of Ni and Fe, were successfully prepared through a homogeneous precipitation method. The formation of LDH structure was verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Other properties were determined such as specific surface area, electrical conductivity, and surface basicity. First-principles DFT+U calculations complemented and supported the electrochemical results. According to both the electrochemical and simulation results, the increase of the catalytic activity for the OER on the presence of Fe3+ is closely related with the configuration and distribution of Fe and Ni cations in the brucite layer structure. The effect of iron is indirect, favoring the electron hopping on the Ni sites for certain local configuration.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000404357700010

In this work, Mn-doping NiO nanoparticles with oxygen (O) vacancies (denoted as Mn-NiO-Ov) are synthesized by calcinating the two-dimensional Ni-Mn layered double hydroxides (LDHs) precursors at specific temperatures. Magically, as revealed by structural characterizations and first-principle quantum chemical computations, Mn-doping causes a modification in the electronic structure through the electron transfer from Ni to Mn via O bridges and the modified e(g) orbital of Ni led by charge transfer is of benefit to the adsorption of O species on Ni sites in Mn-NiO-Ov and promoting the intrinsic metallic property of NiO nanoparticles. Furthermore, it is illustrated that the Mn-NiO-Ov nanoparticles can achieve a lower overpotential of 265 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and a Tafel slope of 61.3 mV dec(-1) under alkaline media. More importantly, the Mn-NiO-Ov nanoparticles show also great stability (98.2%) after 50 h continuously test far more than pure NiO nanoparticles (62.1%). This research provides the theoretical principle for the promotion of electrocatalysts OER activity and stability by doping foreign metal to tune electron configuration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736669700002

These catalysts were investigated simultaneously for electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water oxidation for the first time. Among them, Cu-ZIF-400 can act as the best electrochemical water oxidation catalyst with a low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 342 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. At the same time, a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.1 x 10(-3) s(-1) per metal atom was obtained over Cu-ZIF-400 at neutral conditions, which is comparable to those documented cobalt based catalysts. The different performances of catalysts can be attributed to the different doping methods. We hypothesize that the electrophilic Cu2+ makes the Co more electron-drawing and facilitates the nucleophilic addition of water, which enhanced OER activity of Cu-ZIF-400 catalyst.

This study presents a novel pyridine-type carbonitrides (CN)-modified surface-disordered C-doped TiO2 (PCN/CTiO2@TiO2x) catalyst used for photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water. The employed preparation method of hydrolysiscalcination has the advantages of low-cost raw materials and easy scale-up. The optimized PCN/CTiO2@TiO2x exhibited an impressive hydrogen evolution rate of similar to 3743 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under simulated solar light (AM 1.5) and remained stable after five cycles. The maximal quantum efficiency reached 37.5% at 370 nm and 7.0% at 400 nm, which was superior or comparable to several reported relevant TiO2-based catalysts. Benefiting from the pyridine-type CN modification, disordered surface layer (TiO2-x), and increased oxygen vacancies/Ti3+ species, the photogenerated electrons moved rapidly from the visible-response C-doped TiO2 to CN to participate in the photoreduction reaction, which led to a marked improvement in the catalytic activity.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1932-7447			WOS:000442960300011

Induced by the steps and/or the coadsorbed oxygen, several new SO2 species are observed, in addition to the two known SO2 species on Pt(111). On all investigated surfaces, a hit and stick mechanism is found for the adsorption, and no diffusion from terrace to step sites occurs at low temperatures. For the oxygen free stepped surfaces, a higher reactivity toward SO2 dissociation/disproportionation is found compared to Pt(111). On all three oxygen precovered Pt surfaces some SO3 is already formed directly upon SO2 exposure at low temperatures. Heating of this mixed O/SOx layers first results in oxidation of more SO2 to SO3, and at higher temperatures in subsequent oxidation of SO3 to SO4, which finally decomposes above 450 K. The different reactions show a significant influence of the steps.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000284287900026

The physical characterization including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) show that TiC nanoparticles have cubic structure with grain sizes of 40-90nm. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement indicates that TiC nanoparticles are efficient bi-functional catalysts toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for Li-O-2, batteries, which can effectively compensate for the weak catalytic activity of OER of carbon materials. The results of galvanostatic charge-discharge measurement present that the TiC nanoparticles can reduce the charge-overpotential by 280 mV compared to general carbon materials (Super-P), and the TiC electrode delivers an initial discharge capacity of 1267 mAh.g(-1) at 50 mA.g(-1). Even at a high current density of 150 mA.g(-1), the discharge capacity still maintains 778 mAh.g(-1), indicating excellent rate performance of lithium-air batteries with TiC nanoparticles as catalysts. The TiC electrode displays 10 cycles at a fixed capacity of 500 mAh.g(-1) and at a current density of 100 mA.g(-1). The characterization of XRD, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) show that the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, have great reversibility under the bi-functional catalysis of TiC nanoparticles, which can significantly alleviate the accumulation of undesired byproducts, and eventually improve the electrochemical performance of Li-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-4381			WOS:000468233200004

Considerable efforts in this research area embrace the development of efficient artificial manganese-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using artificial OER catalysts for selective oxygenation of organic substrates to produce value-added chemicals is a worthwhile objective. However, unsatisfying catalytic performance and poor stability have been a fundamental bottleneck in the field of artificial PSII analogs. Herein, for the first time, a manganese-based anode material is developed and paired up for combining electrocatalytic water oxidation and selective oxygenations of organics delivering the highest efficiency reported to date. This can be achieved by employing helical manganese borophosphates, representing a new class of materials. The uniquely high catalytic activity and durability (over 5 months) of the latter precursors in alkaline media are attributed to its unexpected surface transformation into an amorphous MnOx phase with a birnessite-like short-range order and surface-stabilized Mn-III sites under extended electrical bias, as unequivocally demonstrated by a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy as well as ex situ methods.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000611174700001	33491823

Variations in shape, dimensions and chemical state of the Mn-centres were followed by quasi-in situ synchrotron-based scanning photoelectron microscopy with submicron lateral resolution, combined with ex situ Raman measurements, in correspondence of different cyclovoltammetric ageing stages. The decline of the electrocatalytic performance is accompanied by size variations of the MnOx particles that are initially similar to 30 nm in diameter, then shrink to similar to 10 nm and subsequently grow to similar to 45 nm after prolonged ORR. Concerning chemical state, the pristine Mn-0,Mn-II nanoparticles are converted to Mn-III,Mn-IV oxy-hydroxides as a result of a dissolution/redeposition process favoured by the oxygen environment.

In this regard, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) provides an efficient and clean pathway for the mass production of hydrogen fuel and has motivated the design and construction of highly active HER electrocatalysts of an acceptable cost. In particular, graphene-based electrocatalysts commonly exhibit an enhanced HER performance owing to their distinctive structural merits, including a large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good chemical stability. Considering the rapidly growing research enthusiasm for this topic over the last several years, herein, a panoramic review of recent advances in graphene-based electrocatalysts is presented, covering various advanced synthetic strategies, microstructural characterizations, and the applications of such materials in HER electrocatalysis. Lastly, future perspectives on the challenges and opportunities awaiting this emerging field are proposed and discussed.									189	11	0	0	13	0	190			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000485505900001	31496036

In this study, various metal (Fe, Mo, V, Co)-doped Ni2P (NiMP) NWs are synthesized on nickel foam by applying a simple twostep process: cation exchange and phosphorization. The prepared NiMP NWs are electrochemically tested as hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) catalysts under alkaline conditions. The NiMP NWs show highly enhanced OER activities compared to Ni2P NWs. Especially, Fe-doped Ni2P (NiFeP) NWs exhibit the best OER performance with a remarkably low overpotential of 279 mV for 100 mA cm-2 current generation and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec- 1. In HER activity, Mo-doped Ni2P (NiMoP) NWs show a high performance with a low overpotential of 68 mV for generating 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec- 1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are additionally performed to study the metal doping effects on Ni2P HER/OER activities. The calculation results show a high consistency with the experimental catalytic activity results. Overall water splitting (OWS) combining NiMoP/NiFeP as the HER/OER electrodes requires a low potential of 1.57 V to produce a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Finally, assembling our OWS electrodes with a tandem perovskite photovoltaic cell completes an unassisted photovoltaic-electrochemical (PV-EC) system that generates a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 14 %.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000697097800001

However, the catalytic performances cannot be improved to the industrial standard due to the low density of catalytically active sites that are relevant to the size and stability of catalysts. Herein, we synthesized WC catalysts with a mean diameter of 1.9 +/- 0.9 nm, comprising a high density of single W atoms, sub-nanometer and nanometer WC clusters, which are completely encapsulated in high-defective graphitic layers (WC@C). Such high-defective graphitic layers not only improve the overall conductivity for accelerating the penetration and exchange of ions and electrons during the electrocatalytic process of oxygen reduction, but also suppress the chemical/thermal coarsening of WC catalysts, thus providing excellent electrocatalytic performances in four-electron transfer process for oxygen reduction reaction.

However, the OER, kinetics are sluggish and necessitate highly efficient electrocatalysts to speed up the reaction. In this work, we used NiCo glycerate solid nanospheres as a precursor to construct Fe-Ni-Co trimetallic oxide nanospheres utilizing a solvothermal-annealing and stirring technique. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the Fe-Ni-Co spheres was greatly enhanced after Fe doping. Among these samples, the FeNiCo-15 hierarchical yolk-shell spheres needed overpotentials of only 204 and 178 mV for the OER and HER, respectively, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and showed good electrochemical stability. Further, it also presented superior electrocatalytic activity in terms of full water splitting, which was comparable to the integrated performance of the Pt|IrO2 couple.

However, enhancing electrocatalytic activity of CoSe2 to meet the large-scale practical applications is desirable. Herein, we report a facile plasma nitridation strategy to generate N-doped CoSe2 nanomesh arrays on commercial carbon paper (N-CoSe2@CP). The obtained N-CoSe2@CP electrodes combined advantages of abundant electrochemical active sites and beneficial electronic structures, thus exhibiting a low over-potential of 106 mV and 237 mV to drive 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER and OER in alkaline medium, respec-tively. Moreover, it can be employed as bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, where a small potential of 1.57 V was required to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and long-term stability was also realized.

Herein, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculation to systematically explore the catalytic activities of single-metallic organic frameworks (s-MOFs, such as Fe36C108O156), dual-metallic organic frameworks (d-MOFs, such as Fe26Co10C108O156, Fe30Ni6C108O156), and tri-metallic organic frameworks (t-MOFs, such as Fe26Ni2Co8C108O156) for electrocatalytic OER. The DFT calculation and experimental results suggest that the OER performance could be promoted with reduced activation energy barrier and accelerated kinetics by introducing Co and Ni into the unit cell of Material of Institute Lavioisier (MIL). The optimized t-MOFs exhibited an ultra-low overpotential of only 200 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec-1.

During this process, water electrolysis is split into two separate processes, HER and OER, that can proceed at different times and/or in different places. This decoupling strategy can effectively solve the potential hazard of the membrane being permeable to both hydrogen and oxygen, compared with traditional water electrolysis, as well as providing alternatives to storage and transportation of hydrogen. In this paper, recent developments of decoupled water electrolysis were reviewed. The principles of the electrolyser's structure and features of different ECPBs were introduced in detail. Based on the states of the ECPBs and the electrolytes concerned, the parameters of various ECPBs in an acidic electrolyte and an alkaline electrolyte, respectively, were listed. By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of present ECPBs' performance, the prospects and challenges faced by hydrogen production with decoupled water electrolysis were illustrated.			分步法电解水制氢是近年来发展出的一种新型电解水技术,通过在电池中增加电子耦合质子缓冲媒介(ECPBs),使得电解水的析氢反应(HER)与析氧反应(OER)不再关联,可以实现H_2和O_2在不同的时间、不同的地点生成。分步法电解水制氢可以解决传统电解水制氢技术面临的H_2和O_2互相渗透所带来的安全问题,并为氢气的储运提供新的解决方案。本文综述了近年来在分步法电解水方面取得的进展,详细介绍了分步法电解水制氢电解槽结构原理,分步法电解水制氢中可以选择的ECPBs的种类及特点。根据ECPBs的状态及适用的电解液介质,分别列出溶液态和固态电极形态的ECPBs在酸性电解液以及碱性/中性电解液中对应技术参数。通过进一步对比现有ECPBs的优势及不足,总结了分步法电解水所面临的挑战和潜在的发展方向。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-4239			CSCD:6894643

However, it is kinetically not favored and hence requires highly active electrocatalysts. Non-precious metal based catalysts have emerged as the most promising materials for the replacement of state-of-the-art noble metal catalysts. However, more progress is still needed to improve the activity and stability of these catalysts. Herein, we synthesized Co3ZnC/Co nanojunctions encapsulated in highly nitrogen doped graphene layers by one-step annealing of Prussian blue analogues (PBA). The catalyst shows a low overpotential of only 366 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to state-of-the-art commercial RuO2 catalysts. Besides, it exhibits a better performance compared with similar metallic carbide-based catalysts towards ORR with an onset potential and cathodic peak potential at 0.912 V and 0.814 V, respectively.									119	5	0	0	2	0	120			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378947200032

Contrary to natural systems, simple electron donor-acceptor dyads have been developed to attain a long-lived CS state, where the donor and acceptor molecules are linked with a short spacer. In the case of a directly linked zinc chlorin-fullerene dyad, the lifetime of the CS state at - 150 degrees C is as long as 120s. This value is the longest CS lifetime ever reported for porphyrin-based donor-acceptor linked systems. The use of 9-mesityl-10-methylacridinium ion, which has an extremely long-lived CS state, enables the construction of highly efficient photocatalytic systems such as oxygenation of aromatic compounds and hydrogen evolution.									96	2	1	0	5	0	98			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000265372600002

Forming oxygen vacancy on the surface of the metal oxide tune electronic structure is a feasible approach to boost the electroactive of metal oxides for supercapacitor. Herein, an effective solution reduction method is reported for tuning the electronic structure of Co3O4 nanoribbons reacting with NaBH4 to enhance the faradaic redox reaction for high electrochemical performance. The vacancy-rich defects can endow more electroactive sites and reduce the electrical resistance for the enhanced supercapacitor performance. Therefore, compared to pristine Co3O4 (347.4 F g-1), the reduced Co3O4 (R-Co3O4) shows a high specific capacitance (Cs, 464.9 F g-1) and a reduced charge transfer resistance. The asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC, R-Co3O4// active carbon) exhibits an energy density of 18.6 Wh kg- 1 at the power density of 400 W kg- 1 and excellent cycling stability. Such a feasible approach realizes the electronic tuning by creating oxygen vacancy that provides sufficient active sites and activates the fast faradaic redox reaction with enhanced energy storage ability of redox-active electrode materials.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729469900007

In this work, the reaction mechanism of water splitting on gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) is investigated using DFT + U calculations. We found that H-2 evolution preferentially proceeds on the overly hydroxylated surfaces of pure ceria and GDC via the formation of Ce-H and Gd-H intermediates, respectively, which is much more efficient than the H-2 evolution over their partially hydroxylated surfaces. Notably, GDC is more easily and strongly reduced through formation of oxygen vacancies and hydroxyls compared to pure ceria. Thus, the facile formation of the overly hydroxylated states by the incorporation of Gd leads to the improved electrocatalytic activity of water splitting on ceria. These results indicate that a dopant that stabilizes the reduced ceria and favors the formation of metal-H moiety is capable of effectively improving the reaction activity of ceria for water splitting.									16	1	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000460996000038

Using metal-organic frameworks-derived (Ni,Co)Se-2/C hollow rhombic dodecahedra (HRD) as a demonstration, we show that the incorporation of Ni into CoSe2 could generates additional active sites, the hierarchical hollow structure promotes the electrolyte diffusion, the in-situ hybridization with C improves the conductivity. As a result, the (Ni,Co)Se-2/C HRD exhibit superior performance toward the overall water-splitting electrocatalysis in 1 M KOH with a cell voltage as low as 1.58 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making the (Ni,Co)Se-2/C HRD as a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts for water splitting.

The comparison of this catalyst with pure RuO2 and pure IrO2 showed that the obtained mixed oxide catalyst displayed the highest amount of active sites as well as a good accessibility for water. Moreover, this catalyst was shown to be highly stable toward repetitive redox cycling. Polarization curves of the three catalysts showed that the IrO2@RuO2 was the most active for the OER due to the large number and high accessibility of active sites. These catalytic benefic effects are attributed to an intimate contact between the two oxides in the IrO2-covered RuO2 nanocatalyst that combines the RuO2 intrinsic activity and the IrO2 stability. The present study contributes therefore to the rational design of efficient and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting in acidic media.									314	11	0	0	10	0	316			1932-7447			WOS:000370210400010

A moderate HER occurs in K+-containing electrolyte solution favoring the reaction between NO3- and H-2 species, whereas in Na+-containing electrolyte solutions, the HER kinetics was more important leading to a suppression of molecular nitrogen generation.

The transition metal hydroxide is ultrasonically dispersed in distilled water, and acidic organic small molecules are added to it. The mixture is stirred uniformly, and then placed in the reaction kettle for hydrothermal reaction, followed by suction filtration, washing and drying, and then the mixture is placed in a tube furnace for high-temperature pyrolysis to convert the transition metal hydroxide into transition metal oxide, and carbonize the organic small molecule to obtain the required product. USE - Method for preparing carbon-coated transition metal oxide. ADVANTAGE - The method specifically utilizes the acid-base characteristics of the transition metal hydroxide, and alternately uses acidic and basic organic small molecules as carbon sources to realize self-assembled carbon coating on the surface of the transition metal oxide. It controls the reaction conditions to form a coated carbon precursor with different carbon layer numbers under controllable uniform self-assembly on the surface of the transition metal oxide, and then the pyrolysis treatment realizes the controllable carbon layer coating, so that the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst are simultaneously upgraded. The method is simple, highly efficient and low in cost, and can effectively improve the problem of poor catalytic stability of the transition metal oxide oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and has practical significance for promoting the large-scale application of electrolyzed water.															0						DIIDW:201992512T

Herein, we designed an iron-based metal-organic framework (MOF) to realize a configuration variety from the traditional mononuclear configuration (Fe-MOF-M) to the binuclear structure (Fe-MOF-B). The configuration of Fe-MOF was successfully regulated by pH control and nickel was introduced into the iron-based MOF to obtain an efficient heterogeneous electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the dual function of adding Ni atoms, enhanced stability and optimized synergistic effect of different metal sites, the Ni0.8Fe0.2-MOF-B delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 301 mV with a small Tafel slope of 62.3 mV dec(-1) in 0.1 M KOH. This work presents a simple method to adjust configuration and the Ni0.8Fe0.2-MOF-B plays a supporting role to investigate the impact of configuration on OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000819985600001

In this work, we report a CoAl layered double hydroxides (LDH) nanoring evolved from integrate nanosheet in a urea hydrolysis process, showing enhanced oxygen reduction reaction activity. Detailed investigations into the evolution nature suggest that a gradient-increased Al3+ composition exists in the core region of the nanosheet arised from distinctly lower solubility of Al3+ than Co2+ in the synthesis; therefore, the selective etching of Al3+ by OH- produced from urea hydrolysis leads to the formation of nanoring structure. Probed as an oxygen reduction reaction catalyst, the CoAl-LDH nanoring illustrates a half-wave potential lowered by around 110 mV compared to the integrate nanosheet counterpart, which might be due to the exposure of more edge sites with higher activity. This work paves a novel route for fabricating hollow-structured Al-contained metal hydroxides with defined outer edge and inner voids for multiple purposes.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000511246600024	31940197

However, controlled loading of them on rough and conducting substrates is crucial due to their low conductivity. In this work, (CoFe)(OH)(x) nanofilms loaded on coral-like CuO/Cu (CuO/c-Cu) microarray substrates have been prepared in a controllable procedure at an ionic layer level for the first time by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). The (CoFe)(OH)(x) nanofilm is finely prepared by adjusting the SILAR cycles and the Co/Fe ratio in the precursor solution. The optimized (CoFe)(OH)(x) electrocatalyst demonstrates excellent OER performance with a very low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (with no iR compensation), a small Tafel slope (34 mV dec(-1) with iR compensation), and a long-term durability for at least 10 h in 1 M KOH. We also optimize nanofilms of (CoNi)(OH)(x) and (CoNi)S-x on CuO/cCu by SILAR and achieve satisfactory OER performances. Our results display that fine preparation and optimization of semiconductor nanofilms at an ionic layer level provide a promising strategy on fabrication of high-performance electrocatalysts for OER in water electrolysis.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000461150400074

J. Martin et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2013, 6, 3380-3386). The (111) surface showed the highest performance with an oxygen evolution rate of 10 times higher than the other surfaces. The high performance of the (111) surface was attributed to high hole mobility, high surface energy and, in a recent theoretical study (Z. Ma et al., RSC Adv., 2017, 7, 23994-24003), to a lower OH adsorption energy and the band structure. The investigations are based on a few structures and a full atomistic picture of the Ag3PO4 under electrochemical reactions is still missing. Therefore, we report here a systematic study of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of Ag3PO4 (100), (110), and (111) surfaces by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through a detailed investigation of the reaction energies and the overpotentials of OER on all possible surface orientations with all possible terminations and different involvement of Ag adsorption sites, we can confirm that (111) surfaces are highly active. However, surface orientation was not found to exclusively determine the electrochemical activity; neither did the number of Ag atoms involved in the adsorption of the intermediate species nor the type of surface termination or the different potential determining reaction steps. By using Bader charge analysis and investigation of the charge redistribution during OER, we found that the highest activity, i. e. lowest overpotential, is related to the charge redistribution of two OER steps, namely the Oad and the HOOad formation. If the charge redistribution between these steps is small, then the overpotential is small and, hence, the activity is high. Charge redistributions are usually small for the (111) surface and therefore the (111) surface is usually the most active one. The concept of charge redistribution being decisive for the high activity of Ag3PO4 may open a new design strategy for materials with highly efficient electrochemical surfaces.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000472922500056	31020959

Vacancy engineering has been regarded as a promising way to optimize the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts. Herein, we put forward a conceptually new dual Ni,S vacancy engineering on 2D NiPS3 nanosheet (denoted as V-NiPS3) by a simple ball-milling treatment with ultrasonication. This material presents an ideal model for exploring the role of dual vacancies in improving the catalytic activity for overall water splitting. Structural analyses make clear that the formation of dual Ni,S vacancies regulates the electronic structure and catalytic active sites of NiPS3 nanosheet, leading to the superior HER/OER performance. Smaller overpotentials of 124 mV and 290 mV can be achieved at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The OER performance of V-NiPS3 is the best value among all state-of-the-art NiPS3 catalysts. In addition, the assembled two-electrode cell incorporating V-NiPS3 exhibits enhanced catalytic performance with a low cell voltage of 1.60 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work offers a promising avenue to improve the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts by engineering dual vacancies for large-scale water splitting.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000651112900001	33880883

In this work, needle-like Ru-Fe-Ni-P on NiFe foam is prepared through corrosive engineering and following a low-temperature phosphorization procedure for overall water-splitting. The as-designed Ru-Fe-Ni-P exhibits a porous needle-like structure, surface, and binder-free merits, and then can expose rich active sites, favor the transportation of mass/electron, and accelerate the reaction kinetics during catalytic process. Then, the synthesized Ru-Fe-Ni-P owns remarkable catalytic performance for HER, with 18 and 67 mV to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) in alkaline and neutral media. Moreover, a low cell voltage of 1.51 V is required to produce a current of 10 mA.cm(-2) in a two electrode electrolyzer with excellent stability. Interestingly, sustainable energies can power the electrolyzer effectively with abundant hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000860435400013

Herein, we prepared the palladium nanocrystals (Pd NCs) with different morphologies (triangle, nanocubes, and nanodendrites) supported on graphene nanosheets (GNS) by facile hydrothermal method. The shape of Pd-nanodendrites/GNS can be controlled by adjusting hydrothermal reaction time. More importantly, the crystal defects in the Pd-nanodendrites/GNS, such as steps, terraces, and edge-sites atoms, will effectively serve as catalytic active sites. Compared with other morphologies, the Pd-nanodendrites/GNS exhibited superior HER activity in the 1 M KOH solution, such as small overpotential (39.6 mV) required to achieve a 10 mA cm(-2) current density, ultra-low Tafel slope (29.7 mV dec(-1)), and lower charge transfer resistance (R-ct) value of 16.2 Omega, which indicates good conductivity and high electrochemical stability.

Construction of Co-N-x active sites is an important strategy for improving HER activity. We developed a method for thermally controlled construction of the Co-N-x active sites by applying a bottom-up synthetic methodology using an N-doped graphene nanoribbon (N-GNR). Preorganized aromatic rings in the precursors assist graphitization during generation of N-GNR which has N2 sites that coordinate to a cobalt ion. Atomically dispersed Co-N-x sites in the catalysts are observed by electron microscopy. Moreover, the amount of Co-N-x sites increases up to 0.31 wt% as confirmed by XPS and elemental analysis. The Co/N/C catalyst prepared from the precisely designed precursor forming an NGNR shows HER activity with a low overpotential of 258mV (in 1.0M HClO4aq) and 311mV (in 0.1M HClO4aq) at 10 mA.cm(-2), and with a long-term stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000763582700011

When an SECM tip is brought within the tunneling distance from a conductive NP, the particle begins to act as a part of the nanoelectrode. Herein, we demonstrate the possibility of using carbon nanoelectrodes with a very thin insulating sheath for electrochemical tunneling experiments at flat samples. In this way, electrocatalytic activity, conductivity, and charging properties of and faradaic processes in layered nanomaterials can be characterized by single-nanoflake voltammetry without making direct ohmic contact with them. A broad applicability of tunneling SECM experiments is demonstrated by probing nanomaterials with different size, geometry, and electrocatalytic properties, including metallic/pseudo-metallic (1T/1T ') and semiconducting (2H) MoS2 nanoflakes, N-doped porous carbon catalyst, and MXene nanosheets. The Tafel plots for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at individual nanoflakes are compared to analogous measurements for an ensemble of flakes attached to the surface of a macroscopic electrode. Moreover, we observed variations in catalytic activities of individual MXene flakes toward HER and OER caused by non-uniform doping.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000731161000003

First, polyaniline nanorods (PNRs) were grown on the surfaces of the CNFs, and the PNR/CNF hybrids were then decorated with small, well-dispersed and size-controlled AuNPs. The morphology, structure and chemical states of the AuNPs@NCNRs/CNFs hybrids were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The AuNPs@NCNRs/CNFs can be used directly as an electrode and exhibit good HER activity with a relatively low onset potential of 126 mV, a Tafel slope of 93 mV dec(-1) and remarkable durability in 0.5 M H2SO4. The enhancement of the HER activity could be attributed to the synergetic effect between the nitrogen-doped carbon fibers and the AuNPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydrogen has been regarded as the most promising energy carrier due to its high energy density and environmental friendliness. Electrochemical water splitting provides an eco-friendly and sustainable way to produce hydrogen fuel. Therefore, highly efficient electrocatalysts are needed to be exploited for electrochemical water splitting to improve hydrogen production efficiency. Many transition metal-based electrocatalysts, abundant in nature and low cost, have gradually become the focus of research in recent years. Among them, two-dimensional (2D) transition metal-based electrocatalysts are of particular interest as they have the advantages of fast electron/proton transfer and abundant surface catalytic active sites. In this work, 2D transition metal-based electrocatalysts such as 2D transition metal oxide hydroxide, 2D transition metal phosphide, 2D transition metal carbides, etc., and their applications in water splitting are systematically reviewed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0267-0836	1743-2847		WOS:000787194700001

However, the effect of each constituent on overall catalytic activity remains poorly understood. In this study, these effects were explored by using 30 multi-metallic (10 ternary, 10 quaternary, and 10 quinary) catalysts on alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) via an empirical approach. A simple, low-cost electrodeposition method facilitates the fast screening on the configurational entropy of mixing (Delta S-mix) and electrocatalytic activity. The correlation between the Delta S-mix and the AWE activity was investigated. Notably, the quinary catalysts with lower Delta S-mix showed higher activity than ternary and quaternary catalysts. Moreover, among the five elements, the addition of Mo and Fe showed the highest overpotential decrease in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. The Cu-Mo-Ni-Co-Fe catalyst with Delta S-mix of -1.59R exhibited bi-functional activity for HER and OER, resulting that the AWE demonstrated low overpotential of 315 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000769188700001

Here we present a generalized concept, the rate-determining term (RDT). The RDT concept is not simply a semantic change but a nontrivial improvement over the RDS and PDS concepts, as it incorporates the detailed kinetics and thermodynamics of multistep electrocatalytic reactions. The theoretical basis of the RDT concept is steady-state microkinetic modelling, for which we put forward a unified and compact formalism for electrocatalytic reactions with first-order kinetics. The new formalism allows us to write the expression for the rate determining term of the reaction in general and analytical form. The RDT concept is then used to derive analytical expressions for the Tafel slope and the volcano plot of activity that can be used in the studies of multistep electrocatalytic reactions. Thereafter, the efficacy of the RDT concept is demonstrated for two important case studies, the oxygen evolution reaction and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Fundamental insights into the origins of the potential-dependent Tafel slope are obtained. An important consequence, gleaned from this analysis, is that one cannot infer a RDS from measured Tafel slopes. In addition, kinetic factors are shown to exert a notable influence on the slopes and apex location in volcano plots of activity. The present RDT is anticipated to be a powerful analytical tool for multistep electrocatalytic reactions with first-order kinetics. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite of the enormous recent achievements, it is challenging to achieve satisfactory activity and stability at the same time due to lack of fundamental understanding on the activity governing factors. Here, we demonstrate the mechanistic insight of oxygen reduction on the uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles on N-doped carbon support (Ru@NC). The promotion of energy efficient inner-sphere electron transfer mechanism with reduced HO2- generation demonstrates as the crucial descriptor for appreciable activity and remarkable stability. In terms of the mass activity, the developed catalyst outperforms other previously reported state-of-the-art catalysts. The greatly suppressed HO2- generation endows remarkable stability (similar to 6 mV of negative shift in half-wave potential and only 1.9% reduction of activity at 0.9 V after 10000 potential cycles) in alkaline medium. Overall, Ru@NC exhibits remarkably superior stability which is much better than the limit fixed the U.S. of (DOE) and the state-of-the-art Pt/C									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2574-0962			WOS:000734173900004

Herein, we present a non-precious metal catalyst (NPMC) material based on pyrolysed Fe and Co co-doped electrospun carbon nanofibres (CNFs). The prepared materials are studied as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in alkaline and acidic environments. High activity towards the ORR in alkaline solution indicated the suitability of the prepared NPMCs for the application at the AEMFC cathode. In the AEMFC test, the membrane-electrode assembly bearing a cathode with the nanofibre-based catalyst prepared with the ionic liquid (IL) (Fe/ Co/ILeCNFe800b) showed the maximum power density (P-max) of 195 mW cm(-2), which is 78% of the P-max obtained with a commercial Pt/C cathode catalyst. Such high ORR electrocatalytic activity was attributed to the unique CNF structure, high micro-mesoporosity, different nature of nitrogen species and metal-N-x active centres.

The new template-free method based on mechanochemical synthesis acquires holey N-doped matrixes with hierarchically layered structures, micro/mesopores, and higher cobalt loadings as nanoclusters. The synergistic effect within Co-NHCs leads to excellent electrocatalytic activity, showing durable and stable ORR properties with a positive half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs RHE, as well as high stability for HER, exhibiting a low overpotential of 143 mV in the case of 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 1.0 M KOH. Moreover, comparing with those of Pt/C, Co-NHC catalysts offer Zn-air batteries with higher power density and energy density and better stability. This work discloses a promising strategy for making stable and highly efficient catalysts for both ORR and HER in long-life electrochemical storage devices.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000755206200004

The IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode, prepared by thermal decomposition of the precursor added with polyethylene glycol (PEG), achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 0.24 V in a sulfuric acidic solution. The high OER activity is because PEG generated mesopores in the amorphous IrO2-Ta2O5 layer after heating at 350 degrees C. The increase in the double-layer capacitance, proportional to the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), was responsible for the high current density at low overpotentials. Furthermore, the addition of the polymer to the precursor suppressed the dissolution of Ir from the anode during the OER stability test and improved the durability of the IrO2-Ta2O5 electrocatalyst coated on the Ti felt.

Herein, the unique architecture of double-layered FeNi-based nanosheet-stacks grown on Ni foam (Fe:Ni(OH)(2)/FeCe:Ni-(OH)(2)/NF) was induced by Ce ions in the reaction solution. The as synthesized double-layered catalyst on the substrate of the Ni foam exhibited excellent electrochemical behavior in the catalysis of water oxidation. At the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential was as low as 201 mV in alkaline electrolyte. The Tafel slope was only 42.4 mV dec(-1). The high OER electrocatalysis performance of the double-layered nanosheets was related intensely with the introduction of Ce ions, which not only induced the unique architecture of the double-layered vertical nanosheets but also provided more effective charge and mass transfer for electrochemical water oxidation kinetics. These results indicated the promise of expanding the field of lanthanide-doped NiFe-based nanomaterials for applications in energy conversion and storage.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			2168-0485			WOS:000449577200196

The (Mn1/3Co2/3)O nanocrystals were first introduced as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). In addition, the optimum structure of CNT microspheres was designed as efficient support material for (Mn1/3Co2/3)O nanocatalysts with high electrical conductivity and high accommodation ability for Li2O2 products. The macroporous MnCoO-CNT composite microspheres exhibited excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic activities in terms of a positive half-wave potential (0.67 V) for ORRs and high limiting diffusion current (35 mA cm(-2) at 1.0 V) for OERs. When applied as a cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries, the MnCoO-CNT microspheres delivered a high discharge capacity (37142 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)), excellent rate capability (4458 mA h g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1)), and long-term cycle stability (245 cycles at a capacity of 500 mA h g(-1) at 200 mA g(-1)). The synergetic effect of macroporous CNT microspheres with high electrical conductivity and high electrocatalytic activities of the (Mn1/3Co2/3)O nanocatalyst were responsible for the superior performance of MnCoO-CNT composite microspheres as cathode material for Li-O-2 batteries.

The journal of physical chemistry letters				13	35			8386	8396		10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c01557				2022-Sep-08	2022	Defect engineering is an important means of improving the electrochemical performance of the Co3O4 electrocatalyst in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, operando soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS) is used to explore the electronic structure of Co3O4 under OER for the first time. The defect-rich Co3O4 (D-Co3O4) has a Co2.45+ state with Co2+ at both octahedral (Oh) and tetrahedral (Td) sites and Co3+ at Oh, whereas Co3O4 has Co2.6+ with Co2+ and Co3+ at Td and Oh sites, respectively. SXAS reveals that upon increasing the voltage, the Co2+ in D-Co3O4 is converted to low-spin Co3+, some of which is further converted to low-spin Co4+; most Co2+ in Co3O4 is converted to Co3+ but rarely to Co4+. When the voltage is switched off, Co4+ intermediates quickly disappear. These findings reveal Co(Oh) in D-Co3O4 can be rapidly converted to active low-spin Co4+ under operando conditions, which cannot be observed by ex situ XAS.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1948-7185		MEDLINE:36047673	36047673

Herein, Fe/Co-based metal-organic framework (MOF) ultrathin nanosheets doped with (Fe)-Co3S4 metal sulfide (MS) particles (CoFe-MS/MOF) are reported as superior electrocatalysts for the OER. CoFe-MS/MOFs exhibit an outstanding OER performance with a small overpotential of 261 mV and a low Tafel slope of 60.3 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) while showing high durability in an alkaline medium. The existence of metal sulfide particles plays a pivotal part in promoting the charge transfer capacity as well as the formation of ultrathin MOF nanosheets. More significantly, they can also modulate the adsorption energy of oxygenated intermediates, thereby significantly enhancing the inherent electrocatalytic activity.

In this work, green synthesized reduced cobalt ferrocyanide at different time intervals (RCFC-t) was demonstrated as an effective and long-lasting electrocatalyst for the OER process. The RCFC-10 loaded glassy carbon electrode runs at an overpotential of 321 mV (1.55 V) at 10 mA cm(-2) , and a lower overpotential of 291 mV exhibited by the optimal RCFC-10/ nickel foam was almost comparable to the benchmark catalyst, such as IrO2 . This newborn RCFC-10 shows excellent OER performance and durability over 250 h with 4.1% potential loss in alkaline medium. At 1.58 V, the solar-driven water electrolysis demonstration supports the efficiency of a newborn electrocatalyst in solar-to-hydrogen conversion. These research findings confirm that low-cost greener synthesized RCFC-10/NF can be used for large-scale hydrogen generation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000797926200039

Herein, FeNi LDH nanosheet arrays are directly synthesized on various metal foils by a facile hydrothermal method. Compared with single Fe or Ni substrates, the obtained FeNi LDH/FeNi foil exhibited an ultrasmall onset overpotential of similar to 90 mV, high catalytic activity (overpotential of 130 mV @ 10 mA/cm(2)), and durable stability in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. We also demonstrate, by utilizing density functional theory calculations, that the growth of the hydroxide interfacial layer between LDH and FeNi foil makes the LDH possess more favorable adsorption to the OH intermediate during OER than the pure LDH. This reveals that the vertical FeNi LDH arrays on the FeNi alloy substrate are prone to be an efficient catalyst toward OER.									100	8	0	0	1	0	102			2380-8195			WOS:000447581500009

We have envisioned that beta-MnO2 can be made catalytically active by making the inner Mn atoms accessible. In order to accomplish this, we have synthesized MnCO3 nanoplates via a solution route and converted them into highly porous beta-MnO2 nanoplates with very high surface area. In addition to the reduced overpotential of 450 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), the derived Tafel slope was 78.2 mV dec(-1), showing a superior catalytic activity of the porous nanoplate, which is comparable to the catalytic performance of best performing alpha-MnO2 phase. The importance of surface-bound catalytic Mn sites in highly porous beta-MnO2 nanoplates is also demonstrated by Au loading-induced blockage of them and corresponding catalytic activity deterioration.									25	1	0	0	2	0	25			2046-2069			WOS:000372253700007

Microbial activity at the anode and hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode can be controlled by electrode- microbe interaction and electron transfer. The selection of anode electrode material is governed by electrochemical oxidation of substrates and subsequent electron transfer to the anode. Similarly, a good cathodic material should reduce the overpotential at the cathode and enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction and H-2 recovery. This review mainly focused on modifications in electrode materials and cheaper novel alternatives to improve the performance for MEC and overcome its scale-up challenges for practical applications.

J	Peng, Zhiguang; Hu, Lihua; Shi, Jialing; Zheng, Zefeng; Dong, Huafeng; Wang, Tiejun								Gap channel carbon layer coated bimetallic CoFe phosphate as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				538						231571	10.1016/j.jpowsour.2022.231571				AUG 1 2022	2022	Designing efficient non-precious electrocatalysts to facilitate overall water splitting is crucial and highly desirable, but remains challenging. Herein, a carbon-coated bimetallic CoFe phosphate (Co7Fe3-P/C) electrocatalyst is synthesized via simple gel-sol, pyrolysis and phosphating process. Co7Fe3-P/C exhibits excellent activity with low overpotential of 194 and 260 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. With Co7Fe3-P/C as two-electrode for overall water splitting, only a low cell voltage of 1.76 V and 1.88 V is required to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2, which outperform that of the commercial Pt/C-RuO2 couple and reported CoFe alloy materials, showing the promising potential application in the industrial water electrolysis. The superior activity of overall water splitting over carbon-coated bimetallic CoFe phosphate electrocatalyst is attributed to the excellent mass transfer by gap channel of carbon layer, charge enhancement effect by phosphating and in-situ oxidization into its corresponding amorphous (oxy)hydroxides (CoOOH and FeOOH).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000809638100001

However, pyrolyzing MOFs generally involves a complex high-temperature treatment, which can destroy the coordinated surroundings within MOFs, and as a result not taking their full advantage of their electrolysis properties. Herein, a simple and room-temperature boronization strategy is developed to convert nickel zeolite imidazolate framework (Ni-ZIF) nanorods into ultrathin Ni-ZIF/Ni-B nanosheets with abundant crystalline-amorphous phase boundaries. The combined experiment, and theoretical calculation results disclose that the ultrathin thickness allows fast electron transfer and ensures increased exposure of surface coordinatively unsaturated active sites while the crystalline-amorphous interface elaborately changes the potential-determining step to energetically favorable intermediates. As a result, Ni-ZIF/Ni-B nanosheets supported on nickel foam (NF) require overpotentials of 67 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 234 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, Ni-ZIF/Ni-B@NF as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting enables an alkaline electrolyzer with 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.54 V. The present work may open a new avenue to the design of MOF-derived composites for electrocatalysis.									138	8	0	0	5	0	137			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000497887500001

Considering edge sites are the point of activity, efforts were made to control platelet size within the synthesized dispersions. The goal is to controllably isolate and characterize size-reduced NiFe LDH particles. Synthetic approaches for size control of NiFe LDH platelets have not been transferable based on published work with other LDH materials and for that reason, we instead use postsynthetic treatment techniques to improve edge-site density. In the end, size-reduced NiFe LDH/single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) composites allowed to further reduce the OER overpotential to 237 +/- 7 mV (<L> = 0.16 +/- 0.01 mu m, 20 wt% SWCNT), which is one of the best values reported to date. This approach as well improved the long-term activity of the catalyst in operating conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2397-7132		WOS:000684223200001

The spectral study and microscopic analysis demonstrated the formation of NiSe2 nanoparticle/NiO nanosheet heterostructure and efficient Ni-O bond and Ni-Se bond synergism. Owing to various factors such as the strong synergetic coupling effects between NiSe2 nanoparticle and NiO nanosheet, unique structure features, increased active sites and amount of intrinsic Ni3+ ions, efficient synergism was found on the NiSe2 Nanoparticle/NiO nanosheet for urea-assisted water electrolysis by comparing with the NiSe2 Nanoparticle and NiO nanosheet alone. It required a cell voltage of 1.39 V, about 210 mV less than that of water electrolysis, confirming the less energy consumption during the electrolysis. Notably, it also shows remarkably superior long-term durability. The current work may extend the nanoparticle-nanosheet catalysts system for simultaneous wastewater treatment and clean energy production.									143	5	0	0	11	0	145			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000549171400023

Standardized protocols have been developed for determining critical figures of merit, such as the electrochemical surface area, mass activity and specific activity. Even so, when new and more active catalysts are reported, the catalyst stability tends to play a minor role. In this work, we monitor corrosion on RuO2 and MnOx by combining the electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We show that a meaningful estimation of the stability cannot be achieved based on purely electrochemical tests. On the catalysts tested, the anodic dissolution current was four orders of magnitude lower than the total current. We propose that even if long-term testing cannot be replaced, a useful evaluation of the stability can be achieved with short-term tests by using EQCM or ICP-MS.									252	13	0	0	13	0	258			2196-0216			WOS:000346275900006

Applying kinetics control on the one-pot formation process using a syringe pump is emphasized, where the Au/Pd precursor solution is dropwise titrated into the reaction mixture containing capping agent and reductant at an elevated temperature. We perform systematical investigation towards the morphology evolution pathway and effects of several key parameters. After loading on carbon black, the current AuPd alloy nano-corolla exhibit superb specific activity, reaction kinetics, and operation stability for EOR, showing morphological and structural merit. The present study provides insight into fabrication of bimetallic alloy nanocrystals with open structure, which could find important use in crystal engineering for multimetallic nanocrystals and rational design of fuel cell electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000769450100001

In this work, three-dimensional spherical Ni(OH)(2)/NiCo2O4 heterojunctions are prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method and the hybrids are explored as efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte via tuning different Ni/Co atomic ratios of heterojunctions. The optimized Ni(OH)2/NiCo2O4 (S (1:1)) exhibits high electrocatalytic activity with an ultralow over-potential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. With regard to the OER, the over-potential of the as-synthesized S (1:1) heterojunction is only 224 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The improved catalytic performance of the Ni(OH)(2)/NiCo2O4 heterojunctions is attributed to the chemical synergic combining of Ni(OH)(2) and NiCo2O4, large specific surface area for exposing more accessible active sites, and heterointerface for activating the intermediates that facilitates electron/electrolyte transport. The prepared catalyst exhibits good durability and stability in HER and OER catalyzing conditions. This study provides a feasible approach for the building of highly efficient bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts and stimulates the development of renewable energy conversion and storage devices.

In the present work, a novel Ni based MOF and its nanocomposite functionalized with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is synthesized via solvothermal method.

For structural, textural and morphological studies different analytical techniques are applied with subsequent utilization of synthesized materials for catalyzing slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Amongst all Ni-nitrodopamine (NDA/MWCNTs-a) electrocatalyst displays outstanding catalytic activity at low overpotential of 285 mV, small Tafel slope of 73 mV dec-1, and long-term stability of 24 h surpassing the catalytic proficiency for noble metal oxides such as IrO2 and RuO2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000856095700002

Nanostructural engineering is an effective way to achieve improved catalytic performance. Herein, hierarchical nanostructures consisting of porous nanofiber ar-rays on vertically aligned and interconnected copper-cobalt bimetal oxide nanoflakes are fabricated. The effect of annealing temperature and microstructure on the OER performance has been systematically investigated. The optimized sample exhibits a low overpotential of 293 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), with a Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec for OER in an alkaline solution. Effect of nitrogen doping has also been investigated, which results in a further lowered overpotential of 265 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and a 60 mV/dec Tafel slope. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of nanocrystalline catalysts with rationally tuned hierarchical structures in enhancing the OER performance. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

We report that an insulator oxide electroforming phenomenon that occurred during long-term oxygen evolution reaction testing under constant external voltage is the primary reason for the degradation of the silicon MIS photoanode. Compared with TiO2, ZrO2 exhibits high electro-reduce resistance, which minimizes the cation transport in the dielectric film, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of silicon MIS photoanodes. Silicon passivated with an ultrathin ZrO2 film deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) exhibits high stability (>100 h) under alkaline conditions (PH = 14). Combined with a NiFe catalyst, the NiFe/ZrO2/n-Si photoanode exhibits improved OER activity with a low onset potential (similar to 0.96 V versus RHE), a high photocurrent density (26.6 mA.cm(-2)) at 1.23 V versus RHE, and a record high saturated current density of 36.4 mA.cm(-2).									21	1	0	0	1	0	22			2155-5435			WOS:000447224100028

Transition-metal oxides as one of the most common OER electrocatalysts have been widely explored; however, their activity is limited by low electrical conductivity, slow mass transfer, and inadequate active sites. Herein, we develop a feasible strategy in which layered two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) act as templates to construct metal oxide/carbon (MOx/C, M = Co, Ni, and Cu) nanosheet arrays for the OER. Because of improved conductivity and more exposed active sites afforded by their 2D structures with rich hierarchical pores and the incorporation with porous carbon, these 2D MOF-derived MOx/C arrays present high electrocatalytic activities and good durability. Particularly, Co3O4/CBDc, NiO/CBDc, and Cu2O/S-C-TDC exhibit low overpotentials of 208, 285, and 313 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, outperforming all previously reported corresponding metal oxide-based catalysts.									121	14	0	0	5	0	123			2380-8195			WOS:000439083100029

Herein, Ru, B co-doped Ni2P/Ni5P4 nanoparticles (Ru/B-Ni2P/Ni5P4) are obtained by a facile and time-saving approach via ambient reduction followed by a low-temperature phosphorization process. The as-synthesized Ru/B-Ni2P/Ni5P4 exhibits excellent catalytic performances toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with small overpotentials of 270 mV, 31 mV, and 140 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In addition, only a low cell voltage of 1.48 V is required to drive 10 mA cm(-2) for sufficient water splitting in the UOR || HER coupled system.

It is significant to fabricate an efficient OER electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. In this work, bimetallic sulfide nanoparticles (FeNiSs) are prepared by a facile solvothermal method as an OER catalyst. Benefiting from its small particle size and synergistic effect of iron and nickel, this transition-metal sulfide has an excellent catalytic performance for OER. It only needs overpotentials of 223 and 286 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) with an extremely low load of 0.21 mg cm(-2) on noble electrode glassy carbon, respectively. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of 38.2 mV dec(-1) is also extremely low, which means its fast electron transport during OER. Also, it could work as an OER electrode for 100 h without obvious degeneration, which indicates the superb durability. In addition, this facile solvothermal method and synergistic effect can enlighten researchers to explore and develop other efficient and robust electrocatalysts for energy conversions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000716453500062

A large peak, which was particularly well resolved at elevated temperature, was observed on the anodic sweep; the process involved, which had no counterpart on the cathodic sweep, was attributed to catalytic evolution of oxygen, the unusually high activity being of a transitory character. The effect was attributed to the high activity of gold cations emerging through defects in the monolayer oxide film; the subsequent loss of activity was postulated to be due to dimerization of the hydrated cations leading to accumulation of less active hydrous Au(III) oxide species. A remarkable feature of the effect was the degree to which the charge associated with this unusual peak was influenced by prepolarizing the electrode at potentials below ca. 0.1 V (reference hydrogen electrode). Certain similarities in behavior between gold and platinum in this area were pointed out.									26	0	1	0	2	0	27			0013-4651			WOS:A1992HD01200019

In the course of electrosynthesis, the exfoliation of graphite into graphene is combined with the preparation of cobalt-iron oxide, which greatly simplifies the procedure. The obtained Co-Fe/G exhibits an overpotential of 297 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), much lower than that of RuO2 (341 mV 10 mA cm(-2)) with a difference of 44 mV. The characterization results reveal that the superior OER performance of Co-Fe/G is attributed to the composition synergy between the Co and Fe components. The electron transfer over the Fe-O-Co interfacial species along the O bridge not only adjusts the intrinsic electron structure towards a favorable adsorption performance for improving the OER performance but also enhances the conductivity. Moreover, the combined contribution of Co and Fe components enhances the electrochemical active surface area, which in turn promotes the OER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000843680600001

The synthetic processes with an optimized annealing temperature and a rate of calcination process were finely controlled to shape a distinct double-shell nanotube architecture. A low iridium-content oxide alloy (CrxIr1-xO2 with Cr : Ir atomic ratio of 62 : 38) derived from electrospinning and the post-calcination process was the first to reveal the remarkable OER performances in alkaline solution. Moreover, it maintained the performance throughout the long-term chronopotentiometry test at a constant current density of 10 mA cm(-2) without any deterioration. In particular, density functional theory (DFT) calculations prove that the Cr-rich catalyst improves the binding of OOH species on the (110) facet of the CrxIr1-xO2 surface and lowers the Gibbs free energy barrier of the OER process with superior electrocatalytic activity based on the mechanistic inspection of the electrochemical processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000810091000001

Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Mo spacing diaeresis ssbauer spectroscopy showed that the samples are NiFe-carbon fibers and consist of sphere-like NiFe nanoparticles (with diameters in the range 4-12 nm) uniformly dispersed in the fibrillar carbon matrix. Raman spectroscopy revealed the carbon counterpart with D and G bands showing a intensity ratio of 0.8235. The magnetic hysteresis curve at 4 and 300 K are typical of ferromagnetic material. The catalytic activity of NiFe-carbon fibers towards OER under alkaline medium showed an over potential of 296 mV vs. RHE at J = 10 mA cm(-2), and a high electrochemical stability over 15 h under an electrolysis current of J = 10 mA cm(-2).									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000701812000003

Herein, through calcination and nitridation treatment of the Cu-Co based bimetallic metal-organic framework precursor, nitrogen doped CuCo2O4/nitrogen-doped carbon (N-CuCo2O4@N-C) are successfully synthesized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal the evident change of electronic state after doping N atoms into CuCo2O4@N-C. When used as an OER electrocatalyst, N-CuCo2O4@N-C catalysts offer an overpotential of only 260 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to commercial RuO(2)catalyst. The N-CuCo2O4@N-C sample possesses a lower Tafel slope than pristine CuCo2O4@N-C sample. Moreover, a chronoamperometric study reveals that N-CuCo2O4@N-C displays excellent stability for at least 28 h. This work provides a promising heteroatom doping strategy to fabricate high-performance OER electrocatalysts for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2199-692X			WOS:000578499700001

A widely accepted speculation is that the catalysts' activity is insufficient (high reaction barriers need to be overcome). Here, we develop a first-principles method to investigate the photocatalytic OER at the water/TiO2(110) interface. A full mechanism uncovering the importance of radicals is determined. Kinetic analysis further enables to quantitatively estimate each possible obstacle in the process. We demonstrate unambiguously that the rate-determining factor of the OER varies with the concentration of surface-reaching photoholes (Ch+). Under experimental conditions, the intrinsic catalytic activity of TiO2(110) does not represent the main obstacle, but all steps involving the photoholes are slow due to their low concentrations. This suggests that the key to enhance the OER efficiency is to increase Ch+ before Ch+ reaches the estimated threshold (Ch+ = similar to 10(-4)).									135	7	0	0	11	0	135			2520-1158			WOS:000430451900016

Firstly, a NiCo-SiO2 composite film was electro-codeposited from a solution containing (NH4)(2)SiF6, NiSO4, and CoSO4. Then the as-prepared composite layer was underwent consecutive CV scans in concentrated alkaline solution. During this process, the SiO2 template was etched and the NiCo component was activated leading to the generation of a NiCoOx shell. Results shown that this nanostructured NiCo@NiCoOx core-shell layer can provide a current density of 100 mA cm (2) in 1.0 M KOH at a low overpotential of 337 mV and exhibits good stability towards water oxidation. The excellent OER performance is enabled with the unique metal-oxide/hydroxide core-shell structure, which allows high electrical conductivity in the core and high catalytic activity on the shell.

Descriptors of catalytic activity, local coordination environments, and electronic structures of transition-metal dichalcogenides can be modulated via phase transition engineering. Here, we report the strategy to induce transition of CoSe2 from the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase via phosphorus doping. The weak electronegativity of phosphorus as compared to selenium is beneficial for adjusting the amount of d electrons on the Co cation and thus has a significant contribution to structural phase transition and the electrocatalytic activity. As a result, the Li-O-2 battery with the phosphorus-doped orthogonal phase CoSe2 (o-CoSe2IP) electrode exhibits excellent rate capability (with a low overpotential of only 0.44 Vat the current density of 50 mA g(-1)) and cyclability (500 cycles). These experimental results prove that phase transition engineering is an effective strategy for obtaining highly efficient catalysts.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000526363600004

Herein we investigated the stability of NiFe-(oxy)hydroxide anodes at high current densities (100 mA cm(-2)) at different temperatures (25, 75 degrees C) and base concentrations (1, 5, 10 M KOH). While polarization led to minor structural and compositional changes under standard conditions (25 degrees C, 1 M KOH), the anodes were severely impacted at higher temperature (75 degrees C) and base concentrations (5, 10 M KOH). Overall leaching and preferential leaching of Fe (resulting in a lower Fe/Ni ratio) led to decreased OER performance and increased charge transfer resistance for the samples tested at industrially relevant conditions. A dramatic loss in the catalytic activity occurred for the sample polarized at 75 degrees C in 10 M KOH: besides extensive leaching, a transformation of Ni(OH)(2)into NiO was noted in this case. For pure NiOxHy, incorporation of Fe impurities from the electrolyte during polarization at 75 degrees C in 5 M KOH led to an improvement in the catalytic activity and charge-transfer properties, approaching the performance of NiFeOxHy.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000560593800018

Because of the synergistic effects from the abundant presence of the AuNCs-M(OH)(2) interfaces, the AuNCs@M(OH)(2) (M = Co and Ni) nanocomposites demonstrate evidently enhanced activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline condition. Overpotentials of 0.350 and 0.375 V have been obtained at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH for the AuNCs@Co(OH)(2) and AuNCs@Ni(OH)(2), respectively. And at the overpotential of 0.42 V, the current density of AuNCs@M(OH)(2) (M = Co and Ni) nanocomposites is more than 10 times of those generated by their respective metal hydroxides. Compared with monophasic transition metal hydroxides, the AuNCs@M(OH)(2) nanocomposites, especially the AuNCs@Ni(OH)(2), possess excellent OER catalytic stability.									43	1	0	0	1	0	44			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000391160400047

The method includes mass transfer as a consequence of diffusion, convection and migration, combined with the electroneutrality condition and linearized temperature dependent polarization relations at the electrolyte-electrode interface. The electrolyte flow field is calculated using the laminar Navier-Stokes equations for viscous incompressible flow. Heat is generated in the bulk solution and in the electrical double layer. The electrodes are cooled by natural convection. The level set method is used for tracking the anode interface. The model is applied to the electrochemical machining of steel in a supporting electrolyte of NaNO3. Hydrogen is formed at the cathode, and metal dissolution and oxygen evolution is considered at the anode. The effect of water depletion at the electrodes is modelled by limiting the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction rates depending on the surface water concentration. The heat conduction through electrodes and the heat production by the electrode reactions are found to play an important role. (C) 2013 The Authors.

The anodes were preanodized at an anodic current density i(a) of 5 or 0.44 A cm-2 for 20 min before the kinetic parameters of the OER were determined. The electrocatalytic activity decreases significantly in the case of cobalt anodes but remains pratically unaffected in the case of nickel anodes when i(a) is shifted from 0.44 to 5 A cm-2, in the case of prepurifed electrolytes. The behaviour of both substrates is slightly affected by the presence of 1 mM vanadium in the electrolyte. The presence of 0.25mM iron in the electrolyte strongly improves the OER due to (i) a significant decrease of the Tafel slope in case of Ni and (ii) an equally significant increase in the exchange-current density in the case of Co.									21	3	0	0	0	0	23			0360-3199			WOS:A1991FA42100002

Many important questions are still open, making it elusive to establish rational principles for electrocatalyst design. In this work, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to identify which dynamic phenomena at the electrified interface are prerequisite for the formation of molecular hydrogen. In fact, what we observe as an onset of the macroscopic faradaic current originates from dynamic structural changes in the double layer, which are entropic in nature. Based on careful analysis of the activation process, an electrocatalytic descriptor is introduced, evaluated and experimentally confirmed. The catalytic activity descriptor is named as the potential of minimum entropy. The experimentally verified catalytic descriptor reveals significant potential to yield innovative insights for the design of catalytically active materials and interfaces.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000537175100049	32285064

The hydrogen reactions are important, it is vital to examine the evolution of physico-chemical properties at the surface.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, is used to follow the evolution of electronic properties of ZrNi versus the ion sputtering in ultra high vacuum in the range 300-600 degrees C. Morever, the evolution of species concentrations at the surface of ZrNi in the range 100-700 degrees C is followed by means of Auger electron spectroscopy. The present results show that temperature and ion sputtering favor significant changes in surface properties of ZrNi. In situ annealing of ZrNi favors the oxygen decontamination associated with segregation of zirconium metal on the surface. The values of binding energies deduced from the reconstruction of XPS spectra, allowed the identification of species present at the surface. The results indicate that nickel is not contaminated and all the obtained sub-oxides are related to bonding states of oxygen with zirconium (Zr2O, ZrO, ZrO2 and Zr2O3). The ion sputtering of the surface of ZrNi causes preferential sputtering phenomenon. The later results from the removal of surface layers and from the appearance of zirconium oxide layers initially present on the surface. The results obtained by AES show the segregation of impurities (oxygen and carbon) and of zirconium on the surface of ZrNi. AES observations of Zr segregation start to be important above 300 degrees C and this is in agreement with XPS analysis showing a Zr enrichment of the surface of ZrNi.					14th International Conference on Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies (AMPT)14th International Conference on Advances in Materials and Processing Technologies (AMPT)	JUL 13-16, 2011JUL 13-16, 2011	Turkish Airlines; TTNET; Gedik Hold; Istanbul Dev AgcyTurkish Airlines; TTNET; Gedik Hold; Istanbul Dev Agcy	Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-6680		978-3-03785-346-7	WOS:000309565300120

Thus, the vanadium doped cobalt nickel sulfide/phosphide heterostructure catalyst supported on nickel foam (V-CNS/P/NF) is fabricated by sulfidation reaction, followed by phosphorization from the layer double hydroxide (LDH) precursor. After V doping, the peak position of Ni and Co shifts negatively. Simultaneously, it is noted that the introduction of V into CNS/P can result in the enhanced electrochemical surface area and improved conductivity of CNS/P. Importantly, the optimal electrocatalyst of V-CNS/P/N exhibits excellent performance in alkaline condition with small overpotentials of 38 mV and 210 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. Remarkably, V-CNS/P/NF needs lower overpotential than that of Pt/C to reach higher current density of 500 mA cm(-2). A two-electrode system both assembled by as-prepared V-CNS/P/NF for electrochemical water splitting requires a cell voltage of 1.56 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) . (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrary to the case of a porous electrode system, the electrode interface conductivity was found to increase with decreasing P(O-2). With large anodic polarization, the oxide layer was found to be peeled off by oxygen evolution at the electrode/stabilized zirconia interface.

Here, a cobalt (Co) carbonate hydroxide(aamorphous Co-metal-organic framework (CoCH@Co-MOF) core-shell nanowire is grown on carbon fiber paper using a wet-chemistry method for the HER in alkaline electrolyte. The CoCH@Co-MOF exhibits small overpotential, small Tafel slope, and Large exchange current density in the HER because of its Large electrochemical reaction surfaces. In addition, one-dimensional morphology is beneficial to charge conduction, and the amorphous MOF framework endows CoCH@Co-MOF with efficient catalytic activities. The CoCH@Co-MOF nanowire is therefore promising in the HER because of its Low cost, high efficiency, excellent stability, and easy operation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000820415700001

To further enhance the HER efficiency, a chemical modification was applied to VGNHs, and a significant improvement was observed in this work. Specifically, the catalytic performances of electrodeposited CoP on as-grown VGNHs (CoP@VGNHs) and on HNO3-treated VGNHs (CoP@N-VGNHs) were compared. The HER performances of the CoP@N-VGNH hybrid were even superior to those of noble metals, manifesting low overpotentials (eta(10) = 30 mV in acid and eta(10) = 87 mV in alkali), fast electron transfer, and durability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. This emphasizes the potential of physically and chemically modified graphene in the realm of water electrolysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800037

Therefore, we report a simple self-template method to construct Co-Sn-X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages through the anion exchange reaction of CoSn(OH)(6) nanocubes with chalcogenide ions under mild solvothermal conditions. Benefiting from advantageous compositional features and well-designed architectures, the obtained Co-Sn-X (X = S, Se, Te) nanocages display enhanced electrocatalytic activity for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte. Remarkably, the Co-Sn-Se nanocages as the counter electrode (CE) catalyst deliver a prominent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.25% for DSSCs compared with Pt CE (8.19%). Furthermore, when used as an OER catalyst, the Co-Sn-Se nanocages also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity in terms of their low overpotential of 304 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability in 1.0 M KOH solution.

Is there any active catalyst with biphasic structure, in particular the integration of crystalline and amorphous components? Inspired by this question, a crystalline-amorphous biphasic quaternary oxide catalyst is novelly fabricated via one-step solvothermal method in this work. The as-prepared catalyst displays a well-designed coreshell architecture composed of crystalline Co(ZnxNi2-x)O-4 nanorod (core) and amorphous NiO nanosheet (shell). This heterogeneous coreshell catalyst exhibits high activity in the oxygen evolution reaction by demonstrating a low over-potential of 1.57 V vs RHE, a high half-wave potential (0.89 V vs RHE), and long-term electrochemical stability for 25 h. It is found that the synergistic effects from the amorphization of the shell on the one hand, and the atomic/electronic structure of the crystalline core on the other hand, could significantly facilitate the catalytic activity both at the surface and in the bulk volume of the solid oxides. Therefore, this new developed crystalline-amorphous biphasic catalyst could provide instructive roles in the future design of new catalysts for O-2 evolution and other catalytic reactions.

However, the sluggish oxygen redox reaction kinetics in the cathode of Li-O-2 battery severely limits its practical application. The incorporation of cathode electrocatalyst with high activity is an effective strategy to address this issue. Herein we report a novel electrocatalyst of ultrafine Ru/RuOx nanoparticles (NPs) decorated on the surface of carbon nanotubes (Ru/RuOx@CNTs) synthesized by a facile modified ethylene glycol reduction method. The as-prepared Ru/RuOx@CNTs electrocatalyst as cathode for Li-O-2 battery delivers high initial discharge specific capacity up to 3795 mAh g(-1), low overpotential and preferable cycle stability of 113 cycles with a limited specific capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 mA cm(-2) compared with CNTs cathode, which is originated from the well-dispersed Ru/RuOx nanoparticles on CNTs, leading to efficient electrocatalytic activities for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000466520000023

In aerated solutions, increasing the boric acid concentration increases the corrosion rate and the anodic current density. The corrosion rate in deaerated solutions increases with increasing temperature. A corrosion rate peak value is found at approximately 75 degrees C in aerated solutions. Increasing temperature increases the oxygen diffusion coefficient, decreases the dissolved oxygen concentration, accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, and accelerates both the active dissolution and the film forming reactions. Increasing dissolved oxygen concentration does not significantly affect the corrosion rate at 50 and 60 degrees C, increases the corrosion rate at 70 and 80 degrees C, and decreases the corrosion rate at 87.5 and 95 degrees C in a high concentration boric acid solution with lithium hydroxide.

It is shown that molecular oxygen in the acid solution and the transition from the static to dynamic state of an aggressive medium accelerates the corrosion of steel. The corrosion of steel in this environment includes the anodic ionization of steel in the kinetic region and two partial cathodic reactions: the evolution of hydrogen and the reduction of dissolved molecular oxygen, characterized by kinetic and diffusion controls, respectively. Modeling the effect the hydrodynamic mode of the motion of a corrosive medium has on the rate of the cathodic reduction of molecular O-2 on low-carbon steel using the Levich equation and comparing the results to experimental data suggests with high probability that in the flow of a corrosive medium it mainly proceeds according to the scheme O-2 + 2H(+) + 2e = H2O2. The values of the true kinetic currents of the cathodic reaction are estimated for a steel disk electrode in 1 M HCl that is freely aerated with air and forcibly aerated with gaseous O-2. The effective coefficient of diffusion of dissolved molecular O-2 in 1 M HCl is established.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-0244	1531-863X		WOS:000864146600018

The development of effective photoelectrodes is of important to increase the solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency for practical application. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is an outstanding photoanode material because of its relatively narrow band gap, suitable valence band position, and nontoxicity. However, severe charge recombination and slow reaction kinetics limit its PEC performance in the water splitting reaction. Loading cocatalysts on BiVO4 photoanodes has become an important and effective method to enhance PEC water oxidation performance. In this review, we summarize recent important works in coupling a cocatalyst with BiVO4 photoanodes for PEC water splitting reactions. Finally, the foremost challenges and some motivating prospects for future research on coupling cocatalysts with BiVO4 photoanodes materials are presented.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000819203400001

The unique "Fistular onion flower" NiCoP/CoP was synthesized at different temperatures, denoted as CNCP-T (T indicates the temperature, T = 200, 300, 350, and 400 degrees C). Significantly, NiCoP/CoP overcomes the limitation of a single type of active site for the catalyst, and the combination of CoP and NiCoP could provide two different types of active sites for applications in UOR. The dual-category active sites of CNCP-350 demonstrate highly efficient bifunctional catalytic activity in the UOR and HER. Particularly, in the urea electrolyzer (HER||UOR), CNCP-350||CNCP-350 exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.355 V at 10 mA cm(-2). In this work, we achieve efficient UOR to assist in hydrogen production by implementing a synergistic strategy of dual-category active sites and demonstrate its potential feasibility for practical applications in efficient hydrogen production technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2052-1537		WOS:000799545800001

Ni1-xCux/C catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation. Comprehensive characterization of the catalysts included X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic, transmission electron microscopic and cyclic voltammetric analyses, while atomistic Monte Carlo simulations have been undertaken to obtain further insights into the structure of the bimetallic NiCu nanoparticles. We found that compared to monometallic Ni, NiCu nanoparticles show lower propensity towards oxidation under ambient conditions. Furthermore, we report that adding Cu allows increasing the surface-weighted electrocatalytic activity, and the specific surface area of Ni1-xCux/C electrodes, both contributing to a ca four-fold enhancement of the massweighted activity. The nature of the synergistic interactions between Ni and Cu is proposed on the basis of the analysis of experimental data and Monte Carlo structural modelling results.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000363941200005

However, the preparation methods of I-doped graphene (I-G) and its electrocatalysis applications remain largely unexplored. Herein, a one-step and low-temperature hydrothermal approach was developed for the successful synthesis of I-G with a high I-doping level (0.52 at.%). The resulting I-G was then applied as a metal-free catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrochemical sensing. It was shown that the I-G exhibited a dramatically enhanced HER activity compared to undoped graphene, attributed to the critical role of I-doping in offering large exposed active sites and high electron transfer capability. Furthermore, I-G also displayed attractive sensing performances for highly sensitive and selective detection of dopamine. These findings demonstrate that the hydrothermally synthesized I-G can be a promising electrocatalyst for multifunctional applications in water-splitting and electrochemical sensing.

Moreover, an all-solid-state rechargeable ZABs with Ce@(CoO4)-O-3/CNFs cathode was also as-sembled, which shows a relatively narrow discharge-charge voltage gap and a good cycle performance.

In this study, transition-metal (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) phosphates prepared by a solution chemistry method under ambient conditions are found to display interesting electrocatalytic properties for the ORR and OER in alkaline solution. Among them, manganese phosphate is more active than most state-of-the-art manganese oxides for the ORR, and nickel phosphate is as active as the best Ni-based catalysts for the OER. Hence these phosphates can be used as tandem catalysts for rechargeable metal-air batteries in which both the ORR and OER take place. The good performance may be attributed to the stabilization of the catalytic centers by the phosphate framework. This study establishes phosphates as yet another class of highly active low-cost non-platinum group metal alternatives for oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline solution.									104	1	0	0	3	0	104			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000370036900014

We report here a novel, frame-like nanostructured catalyst (Ni,Co)(2)P nanoframe (NF), which consists of heterostructured Ni2P-Co2P nanoparticles embedded in the N-doped carbon matrix. Its synthesis involves precipitation, chemical etching, and a final phosphidation step to give an optimized electronic structure that contains multiple catalytic active sites and facilitates mass transfer. The catalyst is a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER and is superior to the individual components Ni2P and Co2P samples and (Ni,Co)(2)P solid nanocubes. When the (Ni,Co)(2)P NF catalyst was employed as both the cathode and anode for overall water splitting, a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.54 V was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory calculations verify the strong electronic interaction between Ni2P and Co2P at the heterointerfaces, resulting in an optimized hydrogen adsorption strength for enhanced HER electrocatalysis. Moreover, the synthetic strategy has been generalized for the synthesis of Ni-Co dichalcogenide NFs, thereby holding a great promise for a variety of potential applications.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000753956100013

Tremendous accomplishments in the design and fabrication of non-noble metal counterpart to substitute the noble metal catalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and OWS are boosting the development of clean hydrogen fuel production. Recent researches and advances reveal that the surface and interface atomic engineering can readily induce novel physiochemical properties, such as more surface active sites, electronic effect, and strong synergistic effect, offering new and efficient avenues toward largely promoted electrocatalytic performance. In this review, we focus on the recent progress in designing and constructing high-performance non-noble metal catalysts for efficient OER, HER, and OWS through surface and interface engineering. A few of surface and interface effects have been highlighted to account for the influence of electrocatalytic properties observed in catalysts. And a series of the surface and interface engineering strategies have been utilized in non-noble metal counterparts design, including traditional chemical method (e.g. wet-chemical, hydrothermal/annealing), deposition (chemical/electrochemical deposition), and in-situ electrochemical oxidation strategy.

This strong bonding can effectively restrict the diffusion of intermediate Au(0) towards the formation of Au particles during the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process. As such, the single atom Au(i) incorporated GCN maintained superior activities with excellent stabilities for photocatalytic hydrogen generation.									39	2	0	0	2	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400011

In this study, SbVO4 nanoparticles were successfully prepared through hydrothermal treatment of the mixture of SbCl3 and NaVO3 at 180 degrees C for 12 h. The as-prepared SbVO4 nanoparticles were further employed as (photo)electrocatalysts which were deposited on Co foam (denoted as SbVO4@Co foam) and glassy carbon electrode (denoted as SbVO4@GCE), respectively. Contrary to the inferior OER activity of the SbVO4@GCE electrode, the SbVO4@Co foam electrode demonstrated good electrocatalytic OER activity, demanding an overpotential of 387 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 72.9 mV dec(-1). It also displayed excellent photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance and good stability, exhibiting a maximum intrinsic solar to chemical conversion (ISTC) efficiency of 0.23% to achieve the photocurrent density of 298 mA cm(-2) with a potential (U-light) of 1.62 V-RHE. The superior OER performance of SbVO4@Co foam is largely attributed to the integration of SbVO4 nanoparticles and the three-dimensional conductive cobalt foam substrate. The SbVO4@Co foam heterostructure can enhance light absorption by increasing the scattering of incident light, exposing more effective active sites, and facilitating charge and mass transport between electrolyte and electrode material.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000721440100003

The 2H phase, which is thermodynamically more stable with a direct bandgap of about 2.4 eV, can be utilized as a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst owing to its unique photovoltaic and photo-catalytic natures. In this study, we investigate the geometric and the electronic structures at the boundary of the two phases of MoS2, and we find that the excited carrier dynamics at the boundary can lead to far enhanced catalytic activity. By performing real-time time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we identified that the excited electrons in the 2H phase region are transferred and accumulated in the 1T phase region, leading to a charging of the 1T phase region. Thus, surplus charge sharply decreases the dissociation barrier of the adsorbed oxygen molecule, providing a remarkable catalytic nature for the oxygen reduction reaction energy (ORR). We compared the thermodynamics profile of the ORR with that on a platinum (100) surface. We suggest that the MoS2 heterophase boundary can serve as a novel photocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000645887300003

In this work, core-shell heterostructure catalyst by NiP2/NiP nanosheets shelled carbon nanotubes supported on three-dimensional framework were prepared by new effective approach. Benefiting from the unique morphological feature of carbon nanotubes architecture, the synergy of inner carbon nanotubes and outer NiP2/NiP nanosheets, and the good couple interactions at interface between NiP2 and NbP phases, this electrocatalyst showed low overpotential of 137.0 and 248.2 mV for HER and OER at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), respectively. These overpotentials were one of the smallest values of noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, when the advanced catalyst was assembled in two-electrode configuration for full water electrolysis, a very low cell voltage of 1.51 V was required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2 )current density and a higher current density of 100 mA cm(-2 )was reached at a cell voltage of only 2.32 V.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000800589900004

Herein, we develop a strategy involving the in situ generation of a template and pore-former to encapsulate a Ni5P4/Ni2P heterojunction and dispersive FeNi alloy hybrid particles into a three-dimensional hierarchical porous graphitic carbon framework (labeled as Ni5P4/Ni2P-FeNi@C) via a room-temperature solid-state grinding and sodium-carbonate-assisted pyrolysis method. The synergistic effect of the components and the architecture provides a large surface area with a sufficient number of active sites and a hierarchical porous pathway for efficient electron transfer and mass diffusion. Furthermore, a graphitic carbon coating layer restrains the corrosion of alloy particles to boost the long-term durability of the catalyst. Consequently, the Ni5P4/Ni2P-FeNi@C catalyst exhibits extraordinary OER activity with a low overpotential of 242 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalyst in 1 M KOH. Meanwhile, a scale-up of the Ni5P4/Ni2P-FeNi@C catalyst created by a ball-milling method displays a similar level of activity to the above grinding method. In 1 M KOH + seawater electrolyte, Ni5P4/Ni2P-FeNi@C also displays excellent stability; it can continuously operate for 160 h with a negligible potential increase of 2 mV. This work may provide a new avenue for facile mass production of an efficient electrocatalyst for water/seawater splitting and diverse other applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2079-4991		WOS:000809118400001	35683704

However, the OER performance of LDH is unsatisfactory as a result of its limited electro-conductivity and sluggish surficial water oxidation kinetics. Here, we reported a Fe2O3/CoFe-LDH heterostructure electrocatalyst through a facile hydrothermal process. By in situ decorating CoFe-LDH with Fe2O3 nanospheres, a boosted electrocatalytic OER performance is evidenced from the Fe2O3/CoFe-LDH catalysts with an overpotential of 240 mV for the benchmarked current density and a Tafel slope of 70.3 mV dec(-1). As a result of the uniquely matched energy band alignments between Fe2O3 and CoFe-LDH, a Fe2O3/CoFe-LDH interfacial type-II heterojunction is evidenced. As such, the heterojunction-induced charge transfer driving force greatly enhances the charge transfer capability of Fe2O3/CoFe-LDH, thus improving the OER performance. This work offers a novel approach toward enhancing the electron transfer kinetics of general semiconductor-based catalysts by rational heterojunction engineering.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000828422300001

The electrocoatings were obtained from a bath containing dissolved ammonium citrate and cobalt sulphate at pH 9.8 and 23-degrees-C. The charge related to the reduction of oxide(s)/hydroxide(s) (Q(RED)) after preanodization under a current density of 1 A cm-2 at 70-degrees-C increases linearly with the cobalt deposition time. The larger the Q(RED), the better the electrocatalytic activity. For current densities ranging from 10(-4) to 1 A cm-2, log i vs overpotential potential diagrams display a single Tafel region at 40 and 50-degrees-C, compared to two regions at 60, 70 and 80-degrees-C. The high value of the apparent energy of activation in the regions of high overpotentials, i.e. 120 kl mol - 1, means that electrocatalytic activity largely improved from 40 to 80-degrees-C.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0360-3199			WOS:A1992KB73400001

Herein, we report the construction of Mo-doped Ni2P hollow nanostructures through a solvothermal method and in situ phosphorization strategy. The Mo-doped Ni2P hollow nanostructures demonstrate excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in 1.0 M KOH solution with a low cathodic overpotential of 81 mV (10 mA cm(-2), glassy carbon) and a small Tafel slope of 53.4 mV dec(-1). First-principles density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the alkaline HER. For pristine Ni2P, the P site serves as the active center. After Mo doping, the active center transforms to a bridging Mo-Ni site and the corresponding Gibbs free energy of H* absorption (G(H*)) decreases from 0.33 eV (P site) to 0.21 eV (bridging Mo-Ni site). The optimal active site with a smaller G(H*) can accelerate the charge transfer process for H* intermedium and H-2 production. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the Mo-doped Ni2P hollow nanostructures require 270 mV to attain 20 mA cm(-2) (glassy carbon), with a small Tafel slope of 68.5 mV dec(-1). Impressively, both the HER and OER catalysis exhibit durable performance in alkaline electrolyte. When the Mo-doped Ni2P hollow nanostructures are applied as bifunctional electrocatalysts for alkaline overall water splitting, the demanded cell voltage is only 1.54 V (10 mA cm(-2), nickel foam).									82	7	0	0	2	0	83			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463819400033

However, the serpentine materials have poor conductivity and chemical stability, which induce that the activity and stability of these materials are not favorable. Herein, Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets are designed to grow on highly conductive porous Mo2N materials to form composite catalysts for the electrochemical OER. The fabrication of Mo2N/ Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) is achieved via facile hydrothermal methods, and a series of characterizations show that the Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) nanosheets are anchored on porous Mo2N. The as-synthesized composite materials show a remarkably reduced OER over-potential and improved durability compared to pure Ni3Ge2O5(OH)(4) in an alkaline electrolyte. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that Mo2N can efficiently promote the charge transmission and act as a stable substrate to maintain the electrochemical activity. This study provides a facile strategy to design composite-layered serpentine catalysts for an efficient OER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000820766000001

Here, we report an iron single-atom catalyst (SAC) confined in a covalent organic framework (Fe-SAC@COF), which constitutes an unusual Fe-NO coordination in the skeleton. The as-prepared Fe-SAC@COF exhibits a high mass activity of 9.20 A mg(-1), which is 1.95 times higher than Ni species of the same coordination and 5.05 times higher than nanoparticulate Fe counterpart. Moreover, it shows, to the best of our knowledge, a record-low overpotential (290 mV) and Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) among the reported atomically dispersed Fe-based catalysts and surpasses the benchmark Ir/C catalyst. The density functional theory calculation shows that the Fe-NO coordination exhibits low binding energy of oxygenated intermediates, which leads to an outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance. This work provides design strategies toward unusually coordinated SACs by prudent COF confinement for advanced electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2				2666-3864		WOS:000802231400011

We developed a chemical transformation route that can produce both high-performance OER and HER electrodes by corrosion of a Ni foam and subsequent phosphidation process, which generated ternary NiFeCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) and phosphide nanosheets supported on the foam, respectively. Because of their compositions and high electrical conductivities, these ternary LDH and phosphide electrodes exhibited remarkably high activities for OER and HER, respectively, outperforming most of other catalysts reported to date. An alkaline water electrolyzer based on these electrodes achieved a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an only 1.47 V-cell. In addition, anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer based on these electrodes reached a current density of 500 mA/cm(2) at an only 1.75 V-cell.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000708020500005

In the approach, electrochemically activated Ir oxide black (A-IrOx-B) is prepared by the selective etching of a less noble component from the binary oxide. Binary IrOs oxide black (IrOsOx-B) was formed by using a solvent-free method, and then an electrochemical activation was performed by the selective etching of Os oxide in order to obtain the activated Ir oxide black possessing high surface area. Interestingly, it was revealed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of A-IrOx-B surpassed that of IrOx black and approached that of the state-of-the-art surface-segregated IrRu oxide (S-IrRuOx-B). Most notably, the OER activity of S-IrRuOx-B decreased after stability testing because of the dissolution of Ru, while the activity of A-IrOx-B changed little and eventually surpassed the activity of S-IrRuOx-B.									35	2	0	0	2	0	36			2380-8195			WOS:000432478200010

Inspired by the strong points of stability and conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNT5), high catalytic activity of Co nanoparticles, and rapid ion diffusion and large accessible area of three-dimensional (3D) graphene, we demonstrate a novel strategy to construct a hierarchical hybrid structure consisting of Co/CoOx, nanoparticles-incorporated CNT branches onto the 3D reduced graphene oxide (rGO) architecture. The surface-modified 3D rGO by steam activation process has a large surface area and abundant defect sites, which serve as active sites to uniformly grow Co/CoO nano particles. Furthermore, the CNT5 preserve their performance stably by encapsulating Co nanoparticles, while the uniformly decorated Co/CoOx nanoparticles exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution/reduction reaction due to highly exposed active sites. Employing the hybrid particle electrocatalyst, the seawater battery operates stably at 0.01 mA cm(-2) during 50 cycles, owing to the good electrocatalytic ability.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000418392100005

Selection of electrode materials is crucial for electrochemical oxidation process. In this study, Ti/F-PbO2 and Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes were chosen to compare their electrocatalytic characterization, which were prepared by electrodeposition and thermal decomposition method, respectively. The surface morphology and crystal structure of two electrodeswere characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The linear polarization curves show that Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes possess higher oxygen evolution overpotential than Ti/F-PbO2 electrodes. But the stability and corrosion resistance ability of Ti/F-PbO2 electrode was higher than that of Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode. The electrocatalytic activity of Ti/F-PbO2 and Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes was examined for the electrochemical oxidation of malachite green (MG). The bulk electrolysis shows that the Ti/SbSnO2 electrodes exhibit the higher electrocatalytic activity for the degradation of MG than Ti/F-PbO2 electrodes, and the degradation process is good fitting for the pseudo-first order reaction. The higher electrocatalytic activity of Ti/Sb-Snv electrodes can be attributed to the higher oxygen evolution overpotential.									21	0	0	0	6	0	21			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000374710100006

Since water electrolysis is limited by the high overpotential required for the water oxidation reaction, electrocatalysts are applied to reduce the activation energy necessary for this reaction. However, primary catalysts may chemically convert to other compounds during the reaction. Therefore, the physicochemical and electrochemical changes of catalysts used over a long time need to be investigated in detail to understand the real operating catalyst.In this work, we have observed long-term microstructural changes and amorphization of La0.65Sr0.35MnO3 when used as a catalyst in water -electrolysis at near neutral pH. Microscopic and electrochemical analyses show that the catalyst changed at the molecular level. This study revealed that an entirely different catalyst evolved from the original material over the course of the water oxidation reaction.

The synthesized oxynitrides have highly porous structures and consist of small crystallites in the range of 53-630 nm and with specific surface areas in the range of 5.4-14.7 m(2.)g(-1). Interestingly, the Ta5+-to-W4 similar to 6+ substitution in SrW(O,N)(3) can suppress the formation of reduced tungsten species during thermal ammonolysis. The weaker absorptions beyond 560 and 580 nm in the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra, which correspond to reduced tungsten species, are observed in SrW0.75Ta0.25(O,N)(3) and Sr0.875Ba0.125W0.875Ta0.125(O,N)(3) compared to SrW(O,N)(3) and Sr0.75Ba0.25W(O,N)(3). The XPS results reveal that low-valent transition metal oxides, nitrides, and oxynitrides and/or tungsten metal are present on the surfaces of the as-synthesized oxynitrides. After 5 h of the photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, CoOx-loaded SrW0.75Ta0.25(O,N)(3) exhibited the highest amount of evolved O-2 gas due to its higher specific surface area and lower concentration of intrinsic defects. During the photocatalytic reaction, the N-2 gas is also evolved because of the self-oxidation of oxynitrides consuming photo-generated holes. The estimated TONs of the oxynitride samples exceeded one, evidencing that the observed O-2 gas evolution reactions were catalytic. Accordingly, the photostability enhancement of oxynitrides reduces the loss of photo-generated charge carriers and increases their photocatalytic activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2194-1459	2194-1467		WOS:000402409200006

Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)								e2207466	e2207466		10.1002/adma.202207466				2022-Oct-22	2022	To realize sustainable hydrogen economy, corrosion-resistant non-noble-metal catalysts are needed to replace noble-metal-based catalysts. The combination of passivation elements and catalytically active elements is crucial for simultaneously achieving high corrosion resistance and high catalytic activity. Herein, the self-selection/reconstruction characteristics of multi-element (nonary) alloys that could automatically redistribute suitable elements and rearrange surface structures under the target reaction conditions during the oxygen evolution reaction are investigated. The following synergetic effect (i.e., cocktail effect), among the elements Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo, significantly contributes to passivation, whereas Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe enhance the catalytic activity. According to the practical water electrolysis experiments, the self-selected/reconstructed multi-element alloy demonstrates high performance under a similar condition with proton exchange membrane (PEM)-type water electrolysis without obvious degradation during stability tests. This verifies the resistance of the alloy to corrosion when used as an electrode under a practical PEM electrolysis condition. This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, we successfully constructed a tri-phase interfacial structure of CoFe alloy/CoFe oxide/cobalt-doped iron oxide (denoted as CoFe/CoFeOx/Co-Fe3O4) as a highly efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst by a one-step chemical bath deposition approach. The tri-phase interfacial structure was achieved by controlling the dosage of reductants/oxidants and tuning the proportion of Co/Fe salts. The as-prepared CoFe/CoFeOx/Co-Fe3O4 not only delivered a remarkable OER activity, i.e., a low overpotential of 291 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 47.8 mV dec(-1), but also exhibited a decent stability for a long-term electrolysis. To unveil the catalytic mechanism, two reasonable aspects of adsorption regulation of oxygenating intermediates and interfacial charge transfer at electrodes/electrolytes were predictively proposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000862882000001

The decomposition of Fe-based-molecular structures toward Fe-based oxides is a promising method for oxygen -evolution reaction (OER) through water oxidation. The decomposition of Fe-based-molecular structures method results in a slow decomposition of precatalysts and forms Fe oxide-based catalysts. In this study, the Fe species formed through the decomposition of a dinuclear Fe(III) complex under OER is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and the electrochemical method. In addition, using Ni(OH)2, a new approach is reported for detecting trace Fe species on the electrode surface. The resulting Fe oxide-based catalyst shows a catalytic current with an onset of 621 mV overpotential and the Tafel slope of 113.7 mV/decade at pH 11 in a buffer phosphate.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, we report that readily available bare nickel foam (NF) can be used as conductive substrate and precursor to grow a porous nickel oxide (NiO) using a simple and scalable thermal oxidation method. The obtained NiO supported on NF is used as binder-free electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and its electrochemical properties are evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in 1 M KOH. The porous NiO thin film acts as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER and achieves a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 310 mV with a smaller Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1). The electrode also shows good durability over 24h with negligible degradation. This durable and high-performance electrocatalyst can be a competitor to electrocatalysts that consist of costly elements and, require advanced synthesis; the NiO electrocatalyst shows progress towards the replacement of noble metal-based electrocatalysts for the OER.

Two catalytic modes were applied, one was to use potassium to modify coke and another one was to a Mn ore based oxygen carrier. The in-situ catalytic effect of potassium during CLG process was experimentally evaluated in a fluidized bed. The influences of reaction temperature, oxygen carrier to fuel ratio, potassium introduction modes and cycles on syngas yields and distribution, carbon conversion and potassium evolution were investigated. Results indicated that both catalytic modes can accelerate coke conversion. Beneficial coke conversion was brought into play after several cycles' activation for the potassium-modified Mn ore oxygen carrier applied for CLG process. Its activation with cycles led to an increase of the average carbon conversion rate, obtaining a stable value of 4.39%/min, higher than the one of 3.91%/min for the condition without potassium addition. Part of potassium on the surface of oxygen carrier was partially lost in the initial cycles and then fixed on the oxygen carrier particles. The remaining potassium existed in the form of K2Si4O9. The catalytic model of using the potassium to modify coke for CLG process accelerated coke conversion remarkably, obtaining an average carbon conversion rate of 7.8%/min, which is 1.78 times higher than that of using potassium to modify the Mn ore. Besides, the potassium into the reaction process had little effect on the oxygen carrier's reactivity, but accelerated the water gas shift reaction, producing more H-2 and less CO in the syngas.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000709531100012

This Minireview summarizes the latest progress in the use of cocatalysts on hematite electrodes and their application in water splitting induced by sunlight. The major drawback of hole diffusion through a solid-liquid interface is addressed through the selection of the best cocatalyst for increasing the efficiency of an iron-based material. Finally, the most promising modification routes and outstanding materials for enhancing the low kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction during sunlight-driven water oxidation reactions in hematite are provided and those materials that may have a significant impact on the overall photoelectrochemical performance are discussed.									19	4	0	0	0	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000530131500001

Metal coordinated conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) with an inherent rigid structure and customizable elemental composition are regarded as ideal precursors for the target preparation of porous carbon-based catalysts. Whereas it is hard to obtain bifunctional catalysts from monometallic CMPs. Here, we report a bimetallic conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) composed of boron dipyrromethene (bodipy) and Fe/Co-porphyrin (BP-CMP). Direct pyrolysis of the BP-CMP yields a defect-enriched B,N-codoped carbon composite, denoted as BP-800, with embedded Co3Fe7 and Fe/Co-N sites. The high specific surface area (890 m(2) g(-1)) and hierarchical pore structure provide easily accessible active sites, significantly enhancing the oxygen catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the additional doping of B imparts a synergistic effect to the catalyst, which could not only realize the fine adjustment of the electronic properties, but also of the surface polarities of the carbon matrix. Therefore, compared with the B-free catalyst (P-800), BP-800 presents outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity for electrochemical oxygen reactions. For example, it presents superior catalytic performance with a super long-term running stability and fuel immunity, as well as a favored 4e-reduction pathway for the reduction of oxygen (ORR) in the whole pH range. Furthermore, compared with a commercial Pt/C catalyzed battery, the homemade ZABs using BP-800 as the cathode catalyst presented a higher open-circuit voltage (1.526 V), power density (185 mW cm(-2)), discharge specific capacity (776 mA h g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a longer cycle life (94 h at 10 mA cm(-2)), as well as excellent rate capacity. Moreover, owing to the effective protection of porous carbon in the alloy nanoparticles, the rechargeable ZAB with the BP-800 catalyst delivers excellent stability during long-term charging-discharging cycles, comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 benchmarks. This work paves an avenue for the synthesis of stable and efficient electrocatalysts to drive the development of breathing Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000708553700001

As a class of non- precious-metal electrocatalysts, cobalt- and nitrogen-codoped carbon (Co-N/C) catalysts have shown promising activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The further advancement of Co-N/C catalysts is, however, hindered by the poor understanding of their active sites; the typical preparation of Co-N/C catalysts involves high-temperature pyrolysis, yielding catalysts with a heterogeneous distribution of atomically dispersed Co-N-x sites and metallic Co nanoparticles encapsulated in graphitic carbon shells (Co@C). Further, kinetic insights into the HER on Co-N/C catalysts are lacking. In this work, we prepared a series of Co-N/C catalysts with controlled Co-N-x and Co@C site densities, which served as model catalysts for identifying the active sites for the HER. We found that the HER activities in both acidic and alkaline media linearly increased with the number of exposed Co-N-x sites, suggesting that the Co-N-x sites are the major active sites for the HER Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that hydrogen adsorption at Co-N-x sites is closer to the thermoneutral state in comparison to that at Co@C sites, corroborating the HER activity results. Furthermore, pH- and temperature-dependent HER activities combined with in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses on the Co-N/C catalyst comprising only Co-N-x sites provide insights into HER reaction kinetics, including the rate-determining step and spectator species in alkaline electrolytes. The Co-N/C catalyst with Co-N-x sites exhibited long-term durability and stability. This work may shed light on the design of advanced Co-N/C catalysts as well as other M-N/C catalysts for promoting a diverse set of energy conversion reactions.									81	2	0	0	4	0	81			2155-5435			WOS:000455286600010

Developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts with good activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for achieving economical water-splitting devices. In this work, we report a facile strategy to construct a Ni(OH)(2)/MoS2 heterostructure via defect-mediated metal ion adsorption. Abundant defects were introduced into MoS2 nanosheets using ion irradiation. By simply immersing the defective MoS2 nanosheets into a nickel acetate solution, Ni ions were adsorbed on the defect sites of MoS2 nanosheets and then transformed into a Ni hydroxide active phase. The obtained Ni(OH)(2)/irradiated MoS2 heterostructure exhibited both good HER and OER activities owing to the facilitated adsorption of reactants and reaction intermediates, as well as the strong electronic interactions near the heterointerfaces. The methodology used in this work can be generally applied to the synthesis of heterostructured electrocatalysts for other energy and environmental applications.									12	1	0	0	2	0	12			2574-0962			WOS:000557375200113

The electronic regulation via foreign ion/atom doping presents a valid route to improve the intrinsic activity of earth-abundant electrocatalysts. In this research, a facile and cost-effective self-assembly strategy is developed to fabricate the vanadium-doped nickel phosphide electrocatalysts (V-Ni2P) with a three-dimensional nanosheets structure. Then the effect of initial vanadium concentration on the morphology and properties of the target catalyst is investigated. It is found that the V-Ni2P electrocatalyst obtained at the NH4VO3 concentration of 1 mg mL(-1) only requires a low overpotential of 228 mV to afford an OER current density of 80 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) and excellent electrocatalytic stability. On the other hand, enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance can also be acquired based on this unique structure under alkaline conditions. Finally, a water electrolysis device is assembled using V-Ni2P as the cathode and anode materials. To afford a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), this device only needs a small voltage of 1.65 V, suggesting the potential of V-Ni2P as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. This study provides a reference for the preparation of a highly active electrocatalyst with controllable composition and microstructure. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report the development of a superior OER electrocatalyst with outstanding activity, favorable durability, and stable particulate morphology based on an ex situ ultra-fast cation exchange strategy that can result in fine tuning of the atom arrangement inside the oxide lattice, thus optimizing the electrocatalytic performance. O3-phase NaCo0.8Fe0.2O2 (O-NCF) is selected as the starting material, and the sodium in the oxide lattice is rapidly exchanged (several minutes) with hydronium ions (H3O+) in an acidic solution. The as-derived structure fine-tuned sample displays excellent OER performances in alkaline media with an ultra-low overpotential of only 234 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in oxide-based electrocatalysts and an ultra-small Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). The exchange of H3O+ with Na+ does not affect the oxidation state of cobalt and iron cations inside the oxide lattice, while protons in the inserted H3O+ promote the formation of the hydroxyl group to improve activity. As a general strategy, such cation exchange strategy can also be applied to many other layered sodium transition metal oxides.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000530495500054		
J	Todoroki, Naoto; Wadayama, Toshimasa								Electrochemical stability of stainless-steel-made anode for alkaline water electrolysis: Surface catalyst nanostructures and oxygen evolution overpotentials under applying potential cycle loading								ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS				122						106902	10.1016/j.elecom.2020.106902				JAN 2021	2021	We investigated electrochemical stability of the NiFe-hydroxide/oxide-catalyst-layer covered stainless-steel(SS)-anode (NiFe-HyOx/SS) for alkaline water electrolysis. The NiFe-HyOx catalyst layer was synthesized through constant current density electrolysis of 30 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH solution of a 316 SS plate at 75 degrees C for 5 h. The initial overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was estimated to be ca. 270 mV at 100 mA/cm(2) and the potential kept almost constant during applying the 20,000 potential cycles (PCs) of 0.5 and 1.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 7 M KOH at 20 degrees C. Scanning transmission electron microscopic observations conducted before and after the PCs loading revealed that the 50 nm-thick, nanofiber-like NiFe-HyOx catalyst layer remained unchanged in structure and in thickness, while the ca. 850 nm-thick, relatively dense NiFe-(hydro)oxide interlayer was generated under the catalyst layer. The results suggest that the superior OER property of the NiFe-HyOx/SS anode is originated from the surface catalyst layer.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000620267700010

The nanorod morphology with mesoporous nanostructures can handle continuous formation and decomposition of Li2O2 and favors the transport of electrons and ions, therefore improves the rate capability and cycle stability. Moreover, the hierarchical mesoporous Co-CoO/N-CNR reduces the overall overpotential over the cycle and decreases the side reaction between Li2O2 and carbon surface, leading to a significant enhancement of the specific capacity and cycling capability. With the cooperative effect of Co-CoO/N-CNR and porous nature, Co-CoO/N-CNR cathode delivers a high discharge specific capacity of 10,555 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and long cycle stability for over 86 cycles without any capacity loss at a high cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1). Furthermore, excellent performance of 7514 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) is achieved. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									29	2	0	0	0	0	30			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000401686100007

The critical selective pressure could be observed only after aerobic photosynthesis had been developed, due to the high local concentration of oxygen in close vicinity of photosynthesizing cells. It is also postulated that early oxygen-evolving organisms excreted a substantial part of this element in the form of hydrogen peroxide. As a consequence of the high reactivity of this compound with ferrous and manganese cations, an important percentage of iron deposits were produced with H2O2 as a major oxidant after the development of aerobic photosynthesis. It is postulated that negatively charged extracellular polymers of simple pro- and eukaryotic organisms function as sacrificial targets of hydroxyl radicals and at the same time as extracellular equivalents of superoxide dismutases, in these two ways protecting cellular membranes against oxidative damage. The role of oxygen toxicity in developing aerobic mechanisms of iron uptake is also discussed.									27	0	0	0	21	0	27			0303-2647			WOS:A1991FN57000006	1863719

Green hydrogen can be generated by water electrolysis using renewable energies like wind and solar power. When it is combusted, only water forms as by-product. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is hampered by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of the slow kinetics which leads to a high overpotential. Therefore, many catalysts have been developed for OER to facilitate the kinetics and reduce the overpotential. In addition to electrocatalytic activity, the stability of the catalysts is imperative for industrial application and has been intensively studied. In this review, we cover recent findings on the stability and deactivation mechanisms of OER catalysts. We discuss the correlation between OER activity and stability, methodologies and experimental techniques to study the stability and deactivation as well as the deactivation mechanisms, together with factors influencing stability. Furthermore, strategies for stabilizing and regenerating OER catalysts as well as methods to predict stability are summarized. Finally, the review highlights emerging methodologies yet to be explored and future directions of stability studies and the design of highly stable OER catalysts.

Herein, we report Fe-tuned Ni2P electrocatalysts with controllable morphology and structure by regulating atomic ratio of Ni/Fe, and reveal the Fe species-modulated electronic state behaviors and -boosted catalytic activity for water splitting. The electrocatalytic activity of Fe-tuned Ni2P nanosheets for both HER and OER can be further enhanced by assembling the nanosheets vertically on conductive 2D carbon fiber (CF) matrix to make hierarchical monolithic 3D electrode (Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF), which features more accessible active sites and open structure that helps to speed up both the HER and OER. The improved electrocatalytic activity of Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF is due to the combined synergistic effects of the high conductivity of CF matrix and the strong interaction between active species and the CF support, as evidenced by a low overpotential of 293 mV to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 with superior long-term stability for OER. When the monolithic 3D Ni1.5Fe0.5P/CF electrodes were used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is generated at a low potential of 1.589 V, while at 20 mA cm(-2), the potential is only 1.635 V. It has been demonstrated that modulating metal catalysts (nanosized nickel phosphide) with iron atoms is powerful, and may open up avenues to the design and fabrication of highly efficient catalysts for energy storage and conversion.									201	8	0	0	5	0	202			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400383300050

Herein, for the first time, Co-based phosphate ((H(2)en)(0.5)CoPO4)) as a precursor with unique CoO4 tetrahedra and diprotonated ethanediamine template (H(2)en) is simply and rapidly prepared, and the amorphous cobalt phosphate can be obtained via a mild calcination of this host-guest material. Furthermore, the optimal calcined electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 284 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) toward OER and 0.78 V of half-wave potential for ORR in 1.0 m KOH electrolyte. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrocatalyst as the cathode of zinc-air batteries displays a high-power density of 178 mW cm(-2) and specific capacitance of 754.5 mAh g(-1), accompanied by good cycling stability (for 50 h of operation). This work offers a new strategy to design heteroatom doping electrocatalysts using this host-guest method under a mild and environmental condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000727793700001

Therefore, developing efficient OER catalysts is essential to enhance the rate of water electrolysis. Herein, p-n heterojunction arrays which consist of n-type FeCoNi layered double hydroxide (LDH) ultrathin nanosheets anchored vertically on p-type CuO nanowires are constructed on Cu foam. The difference in the Fermi levels of FeCoNi LDH and CuO leads to a built-in electric field at the heterogeneous interface, which induces charge transfer from FeCoNi LDH to CuO, making FeCoNi LDH more positively charged and therefore more favorable for the adsorption of the initial reactant OH-. FeCoNi LDH/CuO/Cu achieves a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 243.1 mV, and is more efficient than pristine CuO/Cu, FeCoNi LDH/Cu, and even RuO2/Cu. Moreover, it can work continuously for 104 h at different applied potentials without significant degradation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the strong trend of OH- to adsorb more readily on FeCoNi LDH in the p-n heterojunction and that the adsorbates interact more strongly with the active sites, which leads to enhanced activity. FeCoNi LDH/CuO/Cu is a highly efficient catalyst with promising applications and would shed light on the method of optimizing the performance of catalysts by modulating the electronic structure of active sites.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000755185700001

This role necessitates the design of highly active, stable, yet earth-abundant heterogeneous catalysts. In this Review, we present the perovskite oxide family as a basis for developing such catalysts for (electro)chemical conversions spanning carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen chemistries. A framework for rationalizing activity trends and guiding perovskite oxide catalyst design is described, followed by illustrations of how a robust understanding of perovskite electronic structure provides fundamental insights into activity, stability, and mechanism in oxygen electrocatalysis. We conclude by outlining how these insights open experimental and computational opportunities to expand the compositional and chemical reaction space for next-generation perovskite catalysts.									715	41	0	0	44	0	727			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000414847100037	29123062

In this paper, the template etching method is used to obtain the nitrogen-doped graphene with abundant macropores embedded with cobalt nanoparticles (Co@N-C). The prepared Co@NC-800 catalyst has a half-wave potential (E(1/2=)0.835 V) close to Pt/C and good stability in excess of Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). At the same time, the catalyst has good oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. In addition, zinc-air batteries (ZABs) based on the Co@NC-800 catalyst show good cycle stability of up to 200000 s and high power density of 73.5 mW cm(-2). The synergistic effect of the integrated component between nitrogen-doped graphene and cobalt nanoparticles as well as the macroporous structure endow Co@NC-800 with abundant exposed active sites and mass/electron transfer capacity, thus leading to the high electrocatalytic activity.

Highly efficient amorphous Ni-Zn double hydroxide nanocages as electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were prepared through a co-precipitate method. We investigated the influence of composition on electrocatalytic activity experimentally. Ni2.7Zn(OH)(x) turned out to be the optimal composition of these samples, which exhibited an OER onset overpotential as low as 0.20 V in 1 M KOH electrolyte solution. In addition, Ni2.7Zn(OH) x could reach a current density of 10 Ag-1 at an overpotential of approximately 0.20 V. Such high mass activity should take advantage of the unique amorphous hollow nanostructure of our sample, which can provide substantial exposure of surface active atoms for remarkable catalytic activity. This amorphous Ni-Zn double hydroxide material was found to be a remarkable OER electrocatalyst and exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity than commercial IrO2.									29	2	0	0	1	0	30				2199-692X		WOS:000383767500003

Hence, we employed a facile electrospinning method to prepare an efficient OER/ORR bifunctional catalyst, where NiCo-based oxides nanoparticles are encapsulated in the carbon nanofibers. The thiourea is used as the dispersant to increase the nanoparticles dispersion and the acetamide is used as the oxidant to prepare the NiCo-bimetallic oxide on carbon nanofibers under protective atmosphere (N-2). The defect-rich interfaces introduced by phase interpenetration between NiCo-oxide and carbon generate abundant atomic traps that capture reactants toward catalytic sites. Furthermore, its unique one-dimensional nanofibers morphology with hierarchically macro/mesoporous nanostructure provides abundant pathways for the transportation of mass and electrons. Benefitting from above advantages, the as-prepared Zn-air battery exhibits a low charge-discharge gap, high power density (155.48 mW cm(-2)), and excellent cycling stability (lifetime over 1500 h @ 5 mA cm(-2)).									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000564499700003

However, their limited catalytically active sites for the HER hinder their practical application. In this paper, the catalytic performances of the edge sites of Janus monolayer MoXY (X/Y = S, Se and Te) were investigated using density functional theory. The results show that both the Mo-edge and chalcogen atomic edges of Janus monolayer MoXY are catalytically active for the HER; thus Janus monolayer MoXY exhibits better catalytic performance than monolayer MoS2. These results are useful for the improvement of the catalytic performance of TMDs by the formation of the Janus monolayer MoXY.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000453935400041	30451272

Therefore, to better research and understand the wettability of gas bubbles, recent progress with interfaces and wettability of bubbles in aqueous media, including superaerophilicity and superaerophobicity, is summarized. Many biological interfaces which exhibit marvelous characteristics are discussed for reference. Because of the similar behavior between gas bubbles in aqueous media and droplets in air, the two wetting conditions are compared together to better illustrate theories of gas bubble wettability. Based on these theories, effective and available manipulation of gas bubbles' wettability provides a novel idea and method to solve practical problems in various aspects, i.e., superaerophobic electrodes for gas evolution reactions, superaerophilic electrodes for gas compensation reactions, superaerophilic interfaces for directional collection and transportation of gas bubbles, and so on.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000449699400001	30335112

Here we report the existence of the most active sites on carbon supported iridium nanoparticles (Ir/C) for HOR/HER in alkaline electrolyte by investigating activities of Ir/C with varying particle sizes in the range of 3-12 nm. The distribution of surface sites is quantified by deconvoluting the H-upd desorption peak in cyclic voltammograms. The portion of the sites with the lowest hydrogen binding energy (HBE) increases with the increase of the particle size or the decrease of the total electrochemical active surface area (t-ECSA). The HOR/HER activity normalized to t-ECSA decreases as t-ECSA increases while it remains constant when normalized to the surface area of the sites with an average HBE of -0.33 eV, accounting for only about 15-30% of the total sites, shoulder the great majority of the HOR/HER activity.									81	10	0	0	0	0	82			2155-5435			WOS:000357626800066

Herein, 6H phase SrIrO3 modified with laminar Sr2IrO4 (SrIrO) have been developed. Unlike the previous extreme chemical state changes of Ir, SrIrO maintained relatively stable surface Ir states during electrocatalysis. The layered nature of Sr2IrO4 enables the interlaminar Sr easily extracted from the crystal while remaining the in-plane IrO6 octahedral framework, thereby stabilizing the Ir state. The SrIrO displays extremely low overpotential of 245 mV for OER and 18.2 mV for HER at 10 mA cm-2, and outstanding catalytic stability. For acidic water splitting, SrIrO requires only 1.50 V to achieve 10 mA cm-2, surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. This work offers a new route for alleviating the surface rearrangements of perovskites, and exploring efficient and stable electrocalysts for hydrogen production via electrochemical water electrolysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663788400003

GaN materials have been studied as novel photoelectrode material due to itschemical stability and easy band gap engineering. Unlike other semiconductor materials thatare easily corroded in strongly acidic or alkaline electrolyte, n-type GaN is chemically stableenough to be used as photoanode in oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, studies on p-typeGaN have been recently reported. This review briefly discusses problems that need to be solvedbefore GaN materials find widespread use in solar fuel application.				본 총설은 질화 갈륨(GaN)을 이용한 광전기화학적 물분해 연구에 대해 정리하였다.

Some of the 2D metal phosphorus chalcogenides (M2P2X6 or plainly MPX3) have been reported to be useful catalysts for water splitting. Herein, the photoresponsivity of a series of synthesized M2P2X6 (M2+ = Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Cd; X = S, Se), tested for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) region in alkaline media, with excitation wavelengths from 385 to 700 nm, is reported. The experimentally determined optical bandgaps of the MPX3 materials range from 1.5 eV for FePSe3 to 3.7 eV for ZnPS3. At +1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity in the OER region of MnPSe3 exhibits superior performance, while the exfoliation of CoPS3 improves its PEC activity up to double in contrast with its bulk counterpart. The influence of the substrate (glassy carbon (GC), indium tin oxide (ITO), and aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)) and applied potential is also studied. Exfoliated CoPS3 reaches a photoresponsivity of up to 0.6 mA W-1 under 450 nm excitation wavelength and at +1.23 V versus RHE in alkaline electrolyte.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-7350			WOS:000642395600001

Either defect or FeN4 site attracts numerous discussion, however, the synergetic effect between them is hardly explored. Herein, we design a facial strategy to synthesize N,P-doped defective carbon nanosheets first (N,P-DC), then cover doped sites with well-define metal-N-4 macrocyclic molecules (FePc@N,P-DC) through non-pyrolysis process. The defective carbon boosts the high spin state of Fe center, thus brings superior ORR performances with the half-wave potential of 0.903 V and excellent cycling-life stability in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations show that the overpotential of FePc@N,P-DC for ORR is 0.52 V, much lower than 0.80 V (N,P-DC). Interestingly, the OER activity is simultaneously improved. This metal-Pc@defective carbon hybrid opens a door to develop electrocatalysts combining atomically metal-N-4 sites with topological defect towards diverse energy conversion type.									119	9	0	0	7	0	119			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300043

Motivated by this point, the inorganic-organic hybridization strategy is proposed to in-situ construct one hierarchical electrode via concurrent electroless plating and polymerization, which assures the growth of boron-modulated nickel-cobalt oxyhydroxide nanoballs and photosensitive polyaniline nanochains on the self-supporting Ti-based foil (B-CoNiOOH/PANI@TiO2/Ti). Upon inducing photoelectric effect (PEE), the designed target electrode delivers overpotentials as low as 196 and 398 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, corresponding to an activity enhancement by about 15% as compared to those without PEE. Inspiringly, when served as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall seawater electrolysis, it can stably maintain at 200 mA cm(-2) with negligible decay over 72 h. Further analysis reveals that the exceptional catalytic performance can be credit to the B-CoNiOOH, polyaniline (PANI) and TiO2 subunit coupling-induced physically and chemically synergistic catalysis effect such as admirable composition stability, photoelectric function and adhesion capability. The finding in this contribution may trigger much more broad interest to the novel hybrid catalysts consisting of photosensitive polymer and transition metal-based electrocatalysts.

To this end, intense research based on the oxygen adsorption energy (E-ads (O)) criterion has been carried out for Pt single crystals, yet hardly can these studies be applied to the alloy system, considering the strain and ligand effects. Here we demonstrated that for a typical alloy (that is Pt1.2Cu octahedron), the activity is in positive correlation with the number of steps which, however, are detrimental to ORR as determined by the E-ads(O) results. Using a combination of kinetics and electron density differences calculations, a novel "hydrogen activation" pathway is put forward. It is shown that the step-edge atoms can apply a repulsive force on the adsorbed hydrogen atoms, which reduces the energy barrier of the rate-determining oxygen hydrogenation process by 0.1 eV compared with the corresponding smooth surface and eventually accelerates the ORR kinetics.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502040600114

Using only 2 % of equivalent charges, 2-methylfuran (2-MF) was oxidized to yield a cation radical, which readily reacted with 3-hexene-2,5-dione, a derivate of 2,5-dimethylfuran, to produce 3-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)hexane-2,5-dione. The product was converted to 4-ethylnonane (a component of biodiesel/jet fuel) in a single step in excellent yield. Importantly, the reaction was not sensitive to oxygen, and a trace amount of water was found to promote the reaction. Detailed mechanistic studies confirmed the proposed reaction pathways. Key to the mechanism is the radical generation that is enabled by electrochemistry. The radical is regenerated at the end of a reaction cycle to ensure chain propagation for an average of ca. 47 times, resulting in an apparent Faradaic efficiency of 4700 %.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000621047100001	33444481

The particles with average size of similar to 10 nm have core@ shell structures with Fe-Fe2O3 cores and NC shells, and the Fe-Fe2O3 cores effectively connect with the NCNT scaffolds via the NC shells. Such a unique structure makes the material a superior oxygen reduction catalyst with an early onset potential (0.92 V), an early half-wave potential (0.72 V), a high current retention (91.7%, after 20,000 s), and good methanol tolerance in an alkaline electrolyte, enabling the catalyst the best among the developed Fe-FeOx oxygen reduction catalysts.

These electrodes consist of micro sized silver grains and polytetrafluoroethylene, forming a homogeneous electrode structure. In this work, we report on the modification of ODCs by implementing an electrospun layer of hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) into the ODC structure, leading to a significantly enhanced ORR performance. The modified electrodes are physically characterized by liquid flow porometry, contact angle measurements and scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical characterization is performed by linear sweep voltammetry and chronopotentiometry. The overpotential for ORR at application near conditions could be reduced by up to 75mV at 4kAm(-2) and 135mV at a higher current density of 9.5kAm(-2). Consequently, we propose that modifying ODCs by electrospinning is an effective and cost-efficient way to further reduce the energy demand of the ORR in highly alkaline media.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000514289900030

A purely orthorhombic structure was found in both monometallic and mixed carbide samples by X-ray diffraction. Transmission electron microscopy images showed that the carbide particles were highly dispersed on the OCNTs with well-controlled particle size. The homogeneous distribution of Mo and W in the carbides was confirmed by elemental mapping. (Mo,W)(2)C/OCNT with a Mo/W ratio of 3 : 1 showed the lowest overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) (87 mV in 0.1 M KOH and 92 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4), and the smallest Tafel slope of 34 mV/dec. Long-term stability under both alkaline and acidic conditions was demonstrated for 24 h. Our results revealed that an optimal amount of W in the mixed carbide can significantly improve its performance in the HER following the Tafel reaction pathway, most likely due to the weakened Mo-H-ads bond.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000516865200014

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting is a slow reaction that consumes much energy to produce hydrogen, and generally, replacing an anodic reaction with less thermodynamic potential can significantly improve the efficiency of hydrogen production. The hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) can be a great alternative to OER. We describe the fabrication of Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu nano-micro dendrite using a simple electrodeposition method. The developed Ni-Cu-P@Ni-Cu is used as a bifunctional electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and HzOR. The high active electrochemical area, the porous structure and the penetration of electrolyte into the pores, the synergistic effect between Ni and Cu, and the rapid separation of the bubbles created from the surface led to the creation of an electrode with excellent electrocatalytic activity. The HER and HzOR processes required only -70 mV vs.RHE and 3.88 mV vs.RHE potentials in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M N2H4, respectively, to generate a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). Also, a very low potential of 125 mV was required in the hybrid overall water electrolysis system. This study presents a new, cost-effective, versatile, and industrial strategy to fabricate three-dimensional electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, we developed a heterostructured electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) comprising La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta and Li2MoO4 (LSC/LMO) with optimized oxidation states for active metal sites using an alkali metal mediator. The LSC/LMO system exhibited excellent OER performance (overpotential: 1.45 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and operational durability (chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetry stabilities of 200 h at 1.52 V and 5000 cycles). The experimental and computational analyses revealed that lithium atoms accumulated at the LSC/LMO interface exhibit a mediating function toward optimizing the oxidation state and electronic structure of OER active metal elements (cobalt and molybdenum), minimizing the free energy barrier of the rate-determining step in OER.

In this study, we constructed amorphous NixCoy layered double hydroxide (LDH) hybridized with three-dimensional NiCo2O4 to fabricate a core-shell nanowire array on Ni foam (NiCo2O4@Ni Coy LDH/NF) as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for overall water electrolysis. By tuning the Ni/Co molar ratio in NixCoy LDH, extremely low overpotentials of 193 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 115 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved for the NiCo2O4@Ni0.796Co LDH/NF. Detailed investigations verify that the hybrid structure can increase intrinsic activity of the NiCo2O4@Ni0.796Co LDH/NF and enhance the charge-transfer rate. Moreover, a strong electronic interaction between the heterogeneous elements Ni and Co at the interface of the NiCo2O4 and NixCoy LDH might ultimately influence the catalytic performance.									51	2	0	0	2	0	51			2168-0485			WOS:000460600500024

The main challenge lies in fabricating high-efficient catalysts with optimized electronic structure and understanding the intrinsic structure-related mechanisms. Here, we report a feasible strategy of regulating the rate-determining step (RDS) of UOR via an electrochemical reconstructed Co hydroxide catalyst incorporated with V single atoms. The optimal catalysts exhibit an enhanced UOR performance after V incorporation while remarkably suppressed the competitive oxygen evolution with the potential of 1.54 V (vs RHE) to achieve the current density of 30 mA cm(-2). Operando synchrotron-radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR) combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that enabled by single atom V incorporation, the RDS of UOR has been changed from the first deprotonation step to the second one with a lower energy barrier of 2.05 eV (vs 2.6 eV), which is thermodynamically favorable for the overall reaction process.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000783147100004

When the evolution occurs on different time scales, a special singular perturbation method may be employed to extract the equations for the slow evolution. The resultant equations have a quite simple form and retain high accuracy in the solutions. For illustration, an H-2/O-2 oxidation model is treated by this method. A general reduced model containing no radicals has been obtained, which can be applied to a wide range of initial conditions and has very good accuracy for the temperature and all the species.

A step-like increase in the nucleation rate with increasing amounts of dissolved oxygen can act as a trigger for the formation of highly reactive components and complete oxidation of iodine to iodate despite the large thermodynamic barrier for the whole process. Energetic coupling of nucleation with chemical reactions is based on local redistribution of energy by collapsing unstable nuclei. The developed model correctly describes the evolution of the measured reaction parameters. It offers a conceptual improvement of formal-kinetic models by drawing attention to important contributions of physical effects to the reaction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000803194200001	35638836

Here, alternative support materials might offer advantages, as they can alter the properties of a catalyst by means of a strong metal support interaction (SMSI) that has been shown to prevent platinum oxidation and suppress the oxygen reduction reaction on titanium oxide supported platinum nanoparticles deposited on a carbon support (Pt/TiOx/C). Herein, we report a novel Ru/TiOx/C catalyst that according to tomographic transmission electron microscopy analysis consists of partially encapsulated Ru particles in a Ru/TiOx-composite matrix supported on a carbon support. It is shown by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that ruthenium oxidation is mitigated by an SMSI between Ru and TiOx after reductive heat-treatment (Ru/TiOx/C-2(400 degrees C,H) ). As a result, the catalyst is capable of oxidizing hydrogen up to the onset of oxygen evolution reaction, in stark contrast to a Ru/C reference catalyst. PEMFC-based hydrogen pump measurements confirmed the stabilization of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity on Ru/TiOx/C-2(400 degrees C,H) and showed a approximate to 3-fold higher HOR activity compared to Ru/C, albeit roughly two orders of magnitude less active than Pt/C.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000769733000001

During this anodization, an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is frequently observed, contributing to reduction of the current efficiency of anodic oxide formation. Based on these factors, evaluation was made of the effect of the electrolyte on oxide film formation and inhibition of the OER during Ti anodization in aqueous H(3)PO(4)and H(2)SO(4)solutions with pH 1. The oxide films were grown by voltammetry and were characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the Mott-Schottky method. Interpretation of the electrochemical results indicated that inhibition of the OER was due to the adsorption of PO(4)(3-)ions and their incorporation during growth of the oxide film. The EIS results showed that the oxide films formed in H(3)PO(4)solution were also the most corrosion resistant.					22nd Symposium of Brazilian Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)22nd Symposium of Brazilian Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)	SEP 01-05, 2019SEP 01-05, 2019		Ribeirao Preto, BRAZILRibeirao Preto, BRAZIL	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000545327700030

The encapsulation of SiW11Co inside ZIF-67 cavitiesvia'in situ' synthesis produced two novel POM@ZIF-67 nanocomposites with low and high POM loadings-SiW11Co@ZIF-67 and SiW11Co[h]@ZIF-67, respectively. Other materials involving the analogue tri-substituted silicotungstate, SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 and SiW9Co3[h]@ZIF-67, have been prepared for comparison reasons. Regardless of the POM substitution degree, we demonstrated that the bidirectional synergistic POM-ZIF-67 interaction found for the already reported material, SiW9Co3@ZIF-67, is applicable to the other first-time prepared nanocomposites. Remarkably, this synergy is radically enhanced in the case of the two high POM loading samples, with these nanostructured materials being very active OER electrocatalysts, exhibiting 150-160 mV decreased overpotentials and much faster kinetics (similar to 35% decreased Tafel slopes) in relation to pristine ZIF-67. Moreover, they reveal intrinsic OER activities higher than those developed by the expensive commercial references (RuO(2)and IrO(2)powders) especially in the case of SiW9Co3[h]@ZIF-67. This important electrocatalytic improvement can be related to the higher POM loadings achieved, as well as to the formation of an open defect-enriched phase wrapping the 'standard' ZIF-67 framework in these nanomaterials.									40	0	0	0	3	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000548452100006

In this work, a hybrid nanoarchitecture of CoP2-Pt-FTO is demonstrated for the bifunctional operations in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of overall water splitting in a single alkaline solution. The bifunctional hybrid nanoarchitecture comes in a simple configuration, incorporating the CoP2 nanoparticles of highly efficient OER component on a thin Pt layer of excellent HER element. The hybrid electrode demonstrates the low overpotentials of 265 and 19.4 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for the OER and HER, respectively, in a single alkaline solution of 1.0 M KOH. A low cell voltage of 1.52 V is demonstrated with an excellent stability at 10 mA/cm(2) for the bifunctional operation of the hybrid electrode. In the hybrid nanoarchitecture, the Pt atoms can play a role of high electrochemical active sites for the Pt-H-ads formation, thus improving the HER. At the same time, the thin Pt layer can also provide a good conducting template for the fabrication of CoP2 nanoparticles by the electrochemical deposition. The positively charged Co+ atoms can actively absorb the hydroxyl receptors (OH-), thus improving OER. Simultaneously, the negatively charged P- atoms can promote the adsorption of H+ protons, thus contributing to the HER. Various hybrid electrode catalysts are successfully fabricated by the control of deposition temperature of CoP2 and thickness of Pt layer, that is, CoPx/Pty, where x is deposition temperature and y Pt thickness and demonstrate the excellent simultaneous operations of OER and HER in a single alkaline solution.

In nature, water oxidation occurs at the oxygen-evolving center of photosystem II, and leads to the generation of oxygen, protons, and electrons. The last two are used for fixation of carbon dioxide to give carbohydrates. In artificial processes, the coupling of water oxidation to evolve O-2 and water reduction to evolve H-2 is known as water splitting, which is an attractive method for solar energy conversion and storage. Because water oxidation is a thermodynamically uphill reaction and is kinetically slow, this reaction causes a bottleneck in large-scale water splitting. As a consequence, the development of new and efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) has attracted extensive attention. Recent efforts have identified a variety of mononuclear earth-abundant transition-metal complexes as active and stable molecular WOCs. This review article summarizes recent progress in research on mononuclear catalysts that are based on first-row transition-metal elements, namely manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper. Particular attention is paid to catalytic mechanisms and the key O-O bond formation steps. This information is critical for designing new catalysts that are highly efficient and stable.

It has been proved that most TM-CxNy candidates are stable and all of them possess metallic features to ensure fast electron transfer. Importantly, Co-C(2)N2 is a bifunctional noble-free single-atom catalyst with low OER/ORR overpotentials (0.33/0.39 V). Furthermore, the impact of the coordination environment on the adsorption trend is revealed by the electronic properties of TM-CxNy. Considering that TM-d electron counts are multiplied by the sum of TM and C/N electronegativity, we propose a universal descriptor and offer more understanding of the coordination-activity correlation. Our findings not only show promising single-atom-embedded C3N candidates for oxygen electrocatalysis but also deeply unveil the impact of the coordination environment on catalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-0485			WOS:000813650300001

The SiBCN/HfC ceramic composites were consolidated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). The influence of high temperature heat treatment on the microstructural evolution and phase composition was investigated. The results showed that the oxygen was introduced during the mechanical alloying process, leading to the oxidation of BN to form B2O3 HfO2 was formed in the sintering process result from HfC oxydation and reduced to HfB2 by carbothermal reduction reaction after heat-treatment at 1600 degrees C for 1 h. Both HfO2 and HfC were reduced to HfB2 during the heat-treatment at 1650 degrees C and 1800 degrees C by reaction of HfC + C + B2O3 -> HfB2 + CO. Introduction of oxygen causes phase transformation of the SiBCN/HfC ceramic composites after heat treatment at high temperatures, during which ceramic matrix becomes loose and porous due to volatilization of the gaseous byproducts. Therefore, control of oxygen content is the key to the real applications of SiBCN/HfC ceramic composites at high temperatures.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1000-324X			WOS:000552710000011

The core enzymes responsible for these reactions are ancient, often small in size, and highly diverse in amino acid sequence, and many require specific transition metals in their active sites. Here we reconstruct the evolution of metal-binding domains in extant oxidoreductases using a flexible network approach and permissive profile alignments based on available microbial genome data. Our results suggest there were at least 10 independent origins of redox domain families. However, we also identified multiple ancient connections between Fe2S2- (adrenodoxin-like) and heme- (cytochrome c) binding domains. Our results suggest that these two iron-containing redox families had a single common ancestor that underwent duplication and divergence. The iron-containing protein family constitutes similar to 50% of all metal-containing oxidoreductases and potentially catalyzed redox reactions in the Archean oceans. Heme-binding domains seem to be derived via modular evolutionary processes that ultimately form the backbone of redox reactions in both anaerobic and aerobic respiration and photosynthesis. The empirically discovered network allows us to peer into the ancient history of microbial metabolism on our planet.									45	1	0	0	29	0	46			0027-8424			WOS:000335798000069	24778258

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is investigated and improved by optimizing the cathode configuration. We demonstrated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements that, using a low-volatile tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEG-DME)-sodium trifluoromethanesulfonate (NaCF3SO3) electrolyte solution, the major discharge product is NaO2. Moreover, we originally demonstrated that controlled amount of superoxide formed at the cathode side by discharge facilitates the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thus resulting in a charge-discharge polarization as low as 400 mV. The developed system can deliver a capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) with an energy efficiency as high as 83% for 60 charge-discharge cycles. The data here reported represent a step-forward in the development of an efficient sodium-air battery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biochemical characterization and sensitivity to photo-inhibition								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				127	2			633	644						OCT 2001	2001	In addition to the four chlorophylls (Chls) involved in primary charge separation, the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center polypeptides, D1 and D2, coordinate a pair of symmetry-related, peripheral accessory Chls. These Chls are axially coordinated by the D1-H118 and D2-H117 residues and are in close association with the proximal Chl antennae proteins, CP43 and CP47. To gain insight into the function(s) of each of the peripheral Chls, we generated site-specific mutations of the amino acid residues that coordinate these Chls and characterized their energy and electron transfer properties. Our results demonstrate that D1-H118 and D2-H117 mutants differ with respect to: (a) their relative numbers of functional PSII complexes, (b) their relative ability to stabilize charge-separated states, (c) light-harvesting efficiency, and (d) their sensitivity to photo-inhibition. The D2-H117N and D2-H117Q mutants had reduced levels of functional PSII complexes and oxygen evolution capacity as well as reduced light-harvesting efficiencies relative to wild-type cells. In contrast, the D1-H118Q mutant was capable of near wild-type rates of oxygen evolution at saturating light intensities. The D1-H118Q mutant also was substantially more resistant to photo-inhibition than wild type. This reduced sensitivity to photo-inhibition is presumably associated with a reduced light-harvesting efficiency in this mutant. Finally, it is noted that the PSII peripheral accessory Chls have similarities to a to a pair of Chls also present in the PSI reaction center complex.									22	2	1	0	21	0	23			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000172144500028	11598237

Herein, we report phosphine reduced an iron-doped tungsten oxide nanoplate/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite (Fe-WOxP/rGO) as an excellent electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction. This electrocatalyst was synthesized using a hydrothermal method, followed by reduction with phosphine (PH3), which was generated from sodium hypophosphite. The catalyst onset potential, Tafel slope, and stability were investigated. Accordingly, Fe-WOxP/rGO exhibited impressively high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 54.60 mV, which is required to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The Tafel slope of 41.99 mV dec(-l) and the linear sweep voltammetry curve is almost the same as 2000 cycles and electrolysis under static overpotential (54.60 mV) is remain for more than 24 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. The catalytic activity and conductivity of FeWOxP/rGO were higher than WOxP, Fe-WOxP and WOxP/rGO. Such an outstanding performance of the Fe-WOxP/rGO nanocomposite is attributed to the coupled synergic effect between high oxygen vacancies formation on tungsten oxide in the nanoplate-like structure of Fe-WOxP and rGO nanosheet, making it as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction.

The evolutions of the morphology, composition, and structure of the as-synthesized KNN nanorods with the increase in reaction time were investigated. The results confirmed that the increase in reaction time up to 3 h led to the increase in the length and aspect ratio of the well-aligned KNN nanorods. All samples have K-rich orthorhombic crystal structures, while the diffraction peaks shifted towards a higher degree. The peak shifts should be attributed to the increase in the Na content in the KNN lattice, which could decrease the lattice parameters owing to the small ionic radius of Na+ than that of K+. Moreover, the increase in reaction time also resulted in the suppression of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the KNN nanorods. These evolutions of the composition and crystal structure, as well as the decrease in the defect content, lead to great enhancement of the nanorod's piezoelectric response, as their d(33) value was increased from 19 to 64 pm/V. These results demonstrated the significant impact of reaction time on the hydrothermal growth of high-performance lead-free KNN one-dimensional nanomaterials.

Dual-phase metal oxide composites of La0.65Sr0.35MnO3-x%CeO2, with x = 0, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100, have been experimentally investigated for oxygen exchange and CO2 splitting via thermochemical redox reactions. The prepared metal oxide powders were tested in a temperature range from 1000 to 1400 degrees C under isothermal and two-step cycling conditions relevant for solar thermochemical fuel production. We reveal synergetic oxygen exchange of the dual-phase composite La0.65Sr0.35MnO3-CeO2 compared to its individual components. The enhanced oxygen exchange in the composite has a beneficial effect on the rate of oxygen release and the total CO produced by CO2 splitting, while it has an adverse effect on the maximum rate of CO evolution. Ex situ Raman and XRD analyses are used to shed light on the relative oxygen content during thermochemical cycling. Based on the relative oxygen content in both phases, we discuss possible mechanisms that can explain the observed behavior. Overall, the presented findings highlight the beneficial effects of dual-phase composites in enhancing the oxygen exchange capacity of redox materials for renewable fuel production.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000555417200037	32551512

The robust thermodynamic, dynamic, and mechanic stability of thgraphene signify the high possibility for experimental synthesis. As a metallic 2D carbon material, thgraphene is proved to be an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), with low overpotentials of 0.14 V and 0.46 V, respectively. Moreover, the HER/OER catalytic activities can be further tuned close to the ideal values by applying a certain amount of strain. Also, we find that thgraphene is a promising anode material for potassium-ion batteries due to its excellent ductility (Poisson's ratio similar to 0.39), ultra-low diffusion barrier (0.06 eV), high theoretical specific capacity (744 mA h g(-1)), and moderate average open-circuit voltage (0.30 V). Our findings highlight a new 2D carbon allotrope as a bifunctional HER/OER electrocatalyst and potassium-ion anode material.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000777590300001

Herein, we present a simple synthetic approach, through a two-step process, to prepare the bifunctional electrode of Co3O4-C@FeMoP hybrid micro rods/nanosheets anchored on nickel foam (NF), in which the Co3O4-C microrods grown on NF surface are decorated by FeMoP nanosheet layers, which is directly grown through a simple hydrothermal followed by post-phosphorization processes. The obtained hybrid hierarchical Co3O4-C@FeMoP/NF shows a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activities of oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/HER) in comparison to the individual Co3O4-C and FeMoP nano-structures, thanks to more heterointerface active sites provided by FeMoP nano-structures with three-dimensional (3-D) layered architectures. The Co3O4-C@FeMoP/NF catalyst exhibits a relatively small overpotential of 200 mV vs. RHE for OER to achieve 20 mA/cm(2) and 123 mV vs RHE at 10 mA/cm(2) for HER along with excellent durability in alkaline electrolytes. We demonstrate the bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode as the electrolyzer for the generation of H-2 via water splitting at small applied voltage of 1.61 V to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) and good stability for 24-h continuous running.

NCM is also a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the catalytic activity is highly correlated to its structure. In this paper, we successfully obtain NCM523 with three different structures: spinel NCM synthesized at low temperature (LT-NCM), disordered NCM (DO-NCM) with lithium deficiency obtained at high temperature, and layered hexagonal NCM at high temperature (HT-NCM). By introducing lithium deficiency to tune the valence state of transition metals in NCM from Ni2+ to Ni3+, DO-NCM exhibits the best catalytic activity with the lowest onset potential (similar to 1.48 V) and Tafel slope (similar to 85.6 mV dec(-1)), whereas HT-NCM exhibits the worst catalytic activity with the highest onset potential (similar to 1.63 V) and Tafel slope (similar to 241.8 mV dec(-1)).									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000518702300043	32043855

Herein, a metal-support structure consisting of silver (Ag) nanoparticles supported by MoO42- intercalated Co-LDH (CoMo-LDH) nanocages (Ag@CoMo-LDH) was developed using a sacrificial template method and a subsequent spontaneous strategy. The resultant hybrid was shown to be a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The required overpoten-tial of Ag@CoMo-LDH for affording a geometric current density of 10 mA cm-2 is as low as 205 mV, which is not only significantly lower than that of separate CoMo-LDH or Ag nanoparticles but also superior to that of most developed OER electrocatalysts reported recently. The constituents and respective work mechanism of Ag@CoMo-LDH are discussed in detail. The superior performance of Ag@CoMo-LDH is related to the unique construction and the effective and stable heterointerfaces between Ag nanoparticles and CoMo-LDH, which accelerate the electron and mass transfer, provide a large number of new active sites and optimize the activity of the original sites. Impressively, Ag@CoMo-LDH also exhibited promising practical prospect on account of the remarkable cyclic and long-term stability. This finding demonstrates that pointedly integrating multiple strategies into one system is a promising way to construct new LDH-based OER electrocatalysts with synthetically improved performance, providing a promising model for developing advanced electrocatalysts in energy conversion devices.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

But, it still maintains the challenge to manipulate the geometric and electronic structure during single reaction process under the same conditions. Herein, we report a simple self-template strategy to generate honeycomb-like Ni2P/N,P-C hybrids with preferred electronic architecture. Experiments coupled with theoretical results revealed that the synthesized catalyst has two characteristics: firstly, the unique honeycomb-like morphology not only enables the fully utilization of catalytic active sites but also optimizes the mass/electron transportation pathway, which favor the diffusion of electrolyte to accessible active sites. Secondly, N,P-C substrate, on the one hand, largely contributes the electronic distribution near Fermi level (E-F) thus boosting its electrical conductivity. On the other hand, the support effect result in the upshift of d-band center and electropositivity of Ni sites, which attenuates the energy barrier for the adsorption of OH- and the formation of *OOH. In consequence, the optimized Ni2P/N,P-C catalysts feature high electrocatalytic activity towards OER (a low overpotential of 252 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)) and 10 h long-term stability, the outstanding performance is comparable to most of transition metal catalysts. This work gives a innovative tactics for contriving original OER electrocatalysts, inspirng deeper understanding of fabricating catalysts by combining theoretical simulation and experiment design.

Primary batteries, especially alkaline and Zn-C batteries, mostly end-up in landfill due to their short lifespan which aggravates health and poses environmental threats. To address these issues, this work establishes a sustainable route for the generation of Manganese oxide (Mn3O4) from spent Zn-C batteries as a catalyst for the OER under alkaline conditions. A thermal transformation study is conducted here at 900 degrees C and 800 degrees C under controlled atmosphere to generate Mn3O4 nanoparticles from waste Zn-C batteries which are investigated as a potential OER catalyst. Mn3O4 particle synthesis was confirmed by XRD, Raman, FTIR, TEM and EDS analysis. The electrochemical performance demonstrated a low overpotential of 360 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) indicating good activity under alkaline conditions. Thus, the generation of Mn3O4 from a spent Zn-C battery that can be employed as a catalyst for the OER is a promising path not only for the effective extraction of resources from battery waste, but also for the exploitation of using extracted materials in advanced technology applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000532669800015

In aerated solutions, increasing the boric acid concentration increases the corrosion rate and the anodic current density. The corrosion rate in deaerated solutions increases with increasing temperature. A corrosion rate peak value is found at approximately 75 degC in aerated solutions. Increasing temperature increases the oxygen diffusion coefficient, decreases the dissolved oxygen concentration, accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, and accelerates both the active dissolution and the film forming reactions. Increasing dissolved oxygen concentration does not significantly affect the corrosion rate at 50 and 60 degC, increases the corrosion rate at 70 and 80 degC, and decreases the corrosion rate at 87.5 and 95 degC in a high concentration boric acid solution with lithium hydroxide.

With the model free method, the activation energy of 281 kJ/mol was obtained, indicating that solid-state diffusion of ions in lattice matrix of iron ore particle was the rate-controlling step. The analysis was therefore extended to obtain the microstructural information of the reduction product. It is found that dense product layers were formed and solid-state diffusion of iron and oxygen ions played a key role in the reduction process. The structure evolution of iron ore particles during the transformation from hematite to magnetite is the same as that from magnetite to wustite, while the transformation from wustite to metallic iron is clearly different. The microstructural changes and the elementary reaction steps during the two types of transformation are obtained and characterized. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report a NH4F-assisted surface multicomponent integration technology to accurately control the ICE, by which oxygen vacancies, spinel-layered coherent structure, and F-doping are skillfully integrated on the surface of treated LLOs microspheres. Though the regulation on the removed amount of labile oxygen by surface integrated structure, the ICE of LLOs cathodes can adjust from starting value to 100 %. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, refined X-ray diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy show that the removed labile oxygen mainly comes from Li2MnO3-like structure. Even operating at a high cut-off voltage of 5 V, the capacity retention of integrated sample at 200 mA g(-1)is still larger than 98 % after 100 cycles.									45	4	0	0	3	0	45			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000577728700001	32820858

Herein, heterostructures of CoSe (cobalt selenide) nanoparticles and MoSe2 (molybdenum selenide) nanosheets (CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids) were fabricated through a non-metal-induced growth method. Due to the increase in the effective specific area and the electron transfer ability caused by the formation of the heterogeneous interface, the obtained CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids show superior OER performance (h = 262 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability (20 h for continuous testing) as compared to pure CoSe, MoSe2 and physically mixed CoSe and MoSe2. Schematic energy band diagrams derived from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirmed the electronic modulation between CoSe and MoSe2 and revealed that the d-band center of CoSe/MoSe2 hybrids moved closer to the Fermi level, giving rise to high charge carrier density and low intermediate adsorption energy as compared to CoSe and MoSe2. This work provides some insight into the design and synthesis of heterostructured nanomaterials from the MOF precursors.									65	3	0	0	3	0	64			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000458682100037

Designing robust and stable electrocatalysts is urgently needed because of the relatively sluggish kinetics of the anodic reaction, i.e. the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we investigate the anomalous in situ activation behaviour of carbon-supported Ni2P nanoparticles (Ni2P/C) during OER catalysis in alkaline media. The activated Ni2P/C shows an exceptionally high activity and stability under OER conditions in which the overpotential needed to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) was reduced from approximately 350 mV to approximately 300 mV after 8,000 cyclic voltammetric scans. In situ and ex situ characterizations indicate that the activity enhancement of Ni2P catalysts is due to a favourable phase transformation of the Ni centre to beta-NiOOH, including increases in the active area induced by structural deformation under the OER conditions. These findings provide new insights towards designing transition metal/phosphide-based materials for an efficient water splitting catalyst.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000407570000113	28811518

Herein, we developed a facile and cost-effective strategy to fabricate a FeNi3/MnFe2O4/nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) nanocomposite by calcining the NiFeMn-layered double hydroxides (LDHs)/polypyrrole (PPy)/RGO precursor at 550 degrees C in Ar atmosphere. The resulting FeNi3/MnFe2O4/N-RGO nanocomposite exhibits not only superior ORR activities (a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.76 V vs. RHE and a J(1600 rpm) of - 4.40 mA cm(-2) at 0.5 V vs. RHE) but also excellent OER activities (an overpotential eta(10 mA cm-2) of 343 mV) in alkaline media. The overall oxygen electrode performance of FeNi3/MnFe2O4/N-RGO demonstrates the smallest Delta E (E-OER,E- 10 mA cm-2-E-ORR,E- -3 mA cm-2) value of 0.85 V compared with the benchmark (commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2/C). Moreover, FeNi3/MnFe2O4/N-RGO also displays superior methanol tolerance in ORR and good durability in both ORR and OER, making it promising applications for oxygen electrocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000490042800002

Herein, phosphorus-doped iron nitride nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets are grown directly on the iron foam substrate (P-Fe3N@NC NSs/IF) by in situ deriving fromSaccharomycetes cerevisiae(S. cerevisiae), where anion elements of C, N, and P all fromS. cerevisiaereplace the hazardous CH4, NH3, and H3P. The diffusion pattern of N, P inS. cerevisiaeand contact form between metal andS. cerevisiaeobservably affect the composition and phase of the product during high-temperature calcination. The obtained P-Fe3N@NC NSs/IF demonstrates superior electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, also satisfying durability. Theoretical calculation confirms that Fe sites of P-Fe3N serve as the active center, and N sites and P doping regulate the hydrogen binding strength to enhance catalytic ability. Additionally, the two-electrode electrolyzer assembled by P-Fe3N@NC NSs/IF as both anode and cathode electrodes needs only 1.61 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2)for overall water splitting with a superb stability. TheS. cerevisiae-based process presents a feasible approach for synthesis of nitrides, carbides, phosphides, and electrocatalytic applications.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000544732900001	32614517

(OER) still remains a great challenge for the large-scale application of renewable energy conversion and storage technologies. Herein, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we systematically explored the potential of pyrrolic-N doped graphene (pyrrolic-N-4-G) supported various transition metal atoms (TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Pd, W, Os, Ir, and Pt) as electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER. Our results revealed that these TM/pyrrolic-N-4-G candidates exhibit high electrochemical stability due to their positive dissolution potentials. Especially, the Ir/pyrrolic-N-4-G can perform as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER with the low overpotentials (eta(ORR) = 0.34 V and eta(OER) = 0.32 V). Interestingly, multiple-level descriptors, including energy descriptor (Delta G(OH)* - Delta G(O)*), (Delta G(OH)*), structure descriptor (phi), and d-band center (epsilon) can well rationalize the origin of the high catalytic activity of Ir/pyrrolic-N-4-G for the ORR/OER. Our findings not only further enrich the SACs, but also open a new avenue to develop novel 2D materials-based SACs for highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

By an in-situ polymerization of dopamine on the surface of ZIF-67, Co~(2+) ions were extracted into the polydopamine shell due to the strong chelation between them and led to the decomposition of ZIF-67, which resulted into a hollow composite of Co-PDA. Subsequently, a yolk-shell structure of metal and nitrogen doped carbon composites (Co@Co-N/C) was obtained by a high temperature pyrolysis at 900℃. The unique structure of Co@Co-N/C provided excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), repetitively. For ORR, the half-wave potential was 0.81 V and the Tafel slope was 60 mV/dec. For OER, the overpotential was 390 mV at the current density of 10 mA /cm~2, and the Tafel slope was 71 mV/dec.

In this respect, zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-derived materials are particularly important for accessing various morphologies, sizes, exposed facets, variations in the electronic structure, high surface area, and large numbers of available active sites. The properties of the ZIF-derived materials can be tuned by applying different synthetic protocols, introducing a heteroatom in the ZIF structure or by accessing core-shell or hollow structures. Many studies have described the beneficial effects of ZIF-derived materials, but no critical review is available in the growing field of electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Herein, we have described the basic principles of material synthesis from ZIFs, their applications in electrochemical processes, difficulties with the synthesis, and their future development.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2196-0216			WOS:000451896100001

However, the commercialization of these devices remains in the sluggish hydrogen electrode reactions due to the requirement of cooperative adsorption of both hydrogen species and hydroxyl species. The research on synergistic alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) electrocatalysts is still in its infancy. This review summarizes the recent progress and strategies in constructing synergistic active sites for advancing alkaline HOR/HER electrocatalysts. The fundamentals of alkaline HOR/HER are first introduced with both theoretical and experimental verifications to rationalizing the necessity of constructing synergistic active sites. Then, this review systemically dissects the functionality of different active sites in recently reported innovative HOR/HER catalysts and introduces the synergistic effects. Finally, some perspectives on the challenges and opportunities for the future design and synthesis of the synergistic HOR and HER electrocatalysts are proposed, intending to promote the application of hydrogen-based energy conversion systems.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000704240000001

Accordingly, the change in the structural integrity under high current density generally results in inconsistent OER performances. To address this challenge, here, we present the intricate design of precatalysts, strategically followed by reconstruction treatment in the presence of Fe under water oxidation condition, which significantly enhances the OER activity and long-term stability. Notably, the surface tailored heterointerface structures (Fe-doped NiOOH/CoOOH) obtained through the reconstruction of a precatalyst (Ni(OH)(2)/Co9S8) with the incorporation of Fe, are abundantly enriched with electrochemically accessible high valence active sites. This results in remarkable OER activity (400 mA cm(-2) at 345 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that Fe-incorporated electrocatalysts give optimal binding energies of OER intermediates and show substantially reduced overpotential compared to Fe-undoped electrocatalysts.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2380-8195			WOS:000731062000023

Metal-nitrogen-carbon (M -N-C) systems have attracted considerable attention recently. Herein, a novel Co-Nx-enriched electrospun porous carbon nanofibrous bifunctional electrocatalyst (Co-Nx/EPCF) is prepared by electrospinning with cobalt nitrate and SiO2, followed by carbonization and acid etching. The catalyst displays an outstanding electrocatalytic ac-tivity of reversible oxygen overpotential (delta E = Ej = 10 -E1/2 = 0.87 V), as well as a high stability. The first -principal calculation reveals that the Co-N-C structure has better ORR paths than that of Co cluster. Further-more, based on the electrocatalyst, the assembled flexible ZABs possess a power density of 81 mW cm(-2), a ca-pacity of 807 mAh gzn- 1, and 111 stability cycles. The study provides a novel strategy to prepare high-performance bifunctional catalysts for wearable power sources.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000839361900004

Herein, 2D MOFs nanosheets decorated with Fe-MOF nanoparticles are synthesized and evaluated as the catalysts for water oxidation catalysis in alkaline medium. A dramatic enhancement of the catalytic activity is demonstrated by introduction of electrochemically inert Fe-MOF nanoparticles onto active 2D MOFs nanosheets. In the case of active Ni-MOF nanosheets (Ni-MOF@Fe-MOF), the overpotential is 265 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH, which is lowered by approximate to 100 mV after hybridization due to the 2D nanosheet morphology and the synergistic effect between Ni active centers and Fe species. Similar performance improvement is also successfully demonstrated in the active NiCo-MOF nanosheets. More importantly, the real catalytic active species in the hybrid Ni-MOF@Fe-MOF catalyst are unraveled. It is found that, NiO nanograins (approximate to 5 nm) are formed in situ during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process and act as OER active centers as well as building blocks of the porous nanosheet catalysts. These findings provide new insights into understanding MOF-based catalysts for water oxidation catalysis, and also shed light on designing highly efficient MOF-derived nanostructures for electrocatalysis.									373	23	0	0	22	0	375			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000436104800021

Here, we developed a nature-inspired etching strategy for the construction of karst topography (KT)-featured electrode comprising core-shell structured Ni(0)@Ni(II) towards efficient OER. Intriguingly, the KT architecture confers a "superaerophobic" surface to render the large amount of generated O-2 bubbles release rapidly and timely from the electrode surface at the high current density of OER (i.e., 1500 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, this strategy allows good control over the generated core-shell structure for promoting the heterointerface synergetic effect of Ni(0)@Ni(II). By adding probing molecules to react with OER intermediates under operation conditions, we obtain first direct experimental evidence that the core-shell structure can optimize the adsorption strength of *OH for significantly boosting the OER kinetics. Notably, the obtained electrode has excellent performance for OER with a small overpotenital of 380 mV at 1500 mA cm(-)(2).									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621625800002

The MnO2 layers could isolate Co2+ ions to provide an environment beneficial for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline electrolyte, where fast electron transfer and high utilization efficiency were achieved. The catalyst with isolated Co2+ ions exhibited a mass activity as high as 63.5 A/g(Co) at an overpotential (eta) of 0.4 V, which was much larger than those of Co ions bound in the oxide network. Moreover, it also exhibited excellent stability for long-term OER operation. Namely, the potential needed to generate a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) increased only 0.073 V during 100 h operation, and no significant change was seen after 100 consecutive potential cycles between +1.0 and +2.0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1932-7447			WOS:000430896500041

Therefore, the development of efficient, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts based on earth abundant elements is highly desired. Herein, we develop a novel method to construct Ni3N@Fe3N heterostructure anchored on carbon fiber (Ni3N@Fe3N/CF-6) consisting of Fe3N nano particles grafted on the metallic Ni3N nanosheets. The results show that of the as-synthesized electrocatalysts, the Ni3N@Fe3N/CF-6 features abundantly exposed interface and active sites, as well as open structure for intimate contact of electrolyte ions and easy release of generated gas. Hence, this Ni3N@Fe3N/CF-6 exhibits a great enhanced OER electrocatalytic performance, including overpotentials as low as 294 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), and a superior stability at a large current density.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			0888-5885			WOS:000417670200011

Although many good OECs have been investigated on conductive substrates under dark conditions, further studies are needed to evaluate their performance when integrated with photoanodes under illumination. Such studies will be facilitated by developing effective coating methods of OECs onto diverse photo anodes. Here, we report a one-step hydrothermal process that conformally coats various photoanodes with ultrathin Ni-doped FeOOH (Ni:FeOOH) OECs. The coated Ni:FeOOH, due to its unique open tunnel structure, tunable Ni doping concentration, and high coating/interface quality, lowers the onset potential of all of the photoanodes investigated, including WO3/BiVO4, WO3, alpha-Fe2O3, TiO2 nanowires, BiVO4 films, and Si wafers. We believe that this simple and yet effective hydrothermal method is a useful addition to the existing deposition techniques for coupling OECs with photoanodes and will greatly facilitate the scale-up of efficient PEC devices.									92	3	0	0	3	0	92			2380-8195			WOS:000389617900023

A one-pot method was used to synthesize self-assembled alloy nanocrystals in one step. By adjusting the composition of synthesized alloys, their properties were optimized. The changes of morphology and property of the alloys after adding Cu were discussed. The HER and MOR properties of alloys were affected by the composition. Especially, the ternary alloy revealed better properties than that of the binary alloy. The starting potential of PtCoCu alloy in HER reaction under visible light is 14mV and the overpotential under 10 mA cm(-1) is 44 mV, which revealed excellent cycle stability. The current density at 0.7 V for MOR reaction can reach 4.2 mA cm(-1). This is ascribed to the composition of alloy. Cu in alloys resulted in plasmainduced effective electron transfer. This result provides a feasible strategy for the design of effective multifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to excellent catalytic activity, the inexpensive M-N-C (M = metal) catalysts are generally considered as the promising electroactive materials for the OER. Recently, research has led to great progress in the performance of M-N-C electrocatalysts. However, the large-scale commercial application of M-N-C catalysts is still limited by their complicated preparation process. Herein, we introduce a facile and efficient Ni-N-C electrocatalyst derived from superabsorbent resin. Benefiting from the strong coupling between the Ni and highly electronegative O and N elements for more available active sites, as well as from a large increase in defects that improve the electronic transmission, the optimized Ni-N-C catalyst exhibits excellent OER catalytic performance, including current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) at an ultra-small overpotential of 214 mV and 20 mA cm(-2) at 245 mV, a low Tafel slope (48 mV dec(-1)), and good stability. Compared with the commercial RuO2 catalyst, the Ni-N-C catalyst developed in this work exhibits good catalytic performance with greatly reduced cost. This work may provide a potential solution for Ni-N-C as an excellent OER catalyst in large-scale industrial water-splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000645583100001

Here, we study the reactivity of chemically produced singlet oxygen with the commonly used cyclic and linear carbonate solvents for LIB electrolytes. On-line gassing analysis of the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC) reveals different stability toward the chemical attack of singlet oxygen, which is produced in situ by photoexcitation of the Rose Bengal dye. Ab initio calculations and on-the-fly simulations reveal a possible reaction mechanism, confirming the experimental findings. In the case of EC, hydrogen peroxide and vinylene carbonate (VC) are found to be the products of the first reaction step of EC with singlet oxygen in the reaction cascade of the EC chemical decomposition. In contrast to EC, simulations suggested DMC to be stable in the presence of singlet oxygen, which was also confirmed experimentally. Hydrogen peroxide is detrimental for cycling of a battery. For all known cathode active materials, the potential where singlet oxygen is released is found to be already high enough to electrochemically oxidize hydrogen peroxide. The formed protons and/or water both react with the typically used LiPF6 salt to HF that then leads to transition metal dissolution from the cathode active materials. This study shows how important the chemical stability toward singlet oxygen is for today's battery systems and that a trade-off will have to be found between chemical and electrochemical stability of the solvent to be used.									64	0	0	0	4	0	64			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000451101200003	30354136

Linear sweep voltammetry estimated onset potential of oxygen evolution reaction from 1.03 to 2.60 V NHE in an inverse relation with the current efficiency of free chlorine generation in NaCl solutions, while further oxidation of free chlorine (chlorate ion generation) underestimated the current efficiency on Pt and boron doped diamond. Electrochemical oxidation experiments at 50 mA cm(-2) confirmed the free chlorine to be the primary oxidant for chemical oxygen demand degradation on the dimensionally stable anodes since the current efficiency of free chlorine generation (25-35%) was comparable with the current efficiency of chemical oxygen demand degradation. The ClO3- generation on Pt was retarded in alginic acid degradation, but effective during glucose degradation due to different reactivity with free chlorine. For boron doped diamond, direct and center dot OH mediated oxidation were significant (11% for alginic acid and 22% for glucose) and competition among organic pollutants, Cl-, and free chlorine for center dot OH determined the current efficiency of organic compounds degradation. In a saline water, IrO2 anode was the most energy-efficient (specific energy consumption for alginic acid: 48 Wh gCOD(-1)) with minimal formation of ClO3-.

Production of hydrogen by electrochemical water splitting requires efficient electrocatalysts to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Transition metal phosphides are regarded as promising substitutes for precious metals as HER electrocatalysts. This review focuses on the recent progress with respect to the advantages, common synthetic approaches and enhancement strategies of Fe, Co and Ni-based phosphides, with important works in each section elaborately introduced for researchers in the relevant area. After the rational design and fabrication, Fe, Co and Ni-based phosphides can become highly efficient, durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts, and thereby exhibit a great potential for the scale-up production of hydrogen fuel.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000547221500002

In this study, we employ timeresolved operando spectroelectrochemistry to investigate the redox-state kinetics of IrOx electrocatalyst films for both water and hydrogen peroxide oxidation. Three different redox species involving Ir3+, Ir3.x+, Ir4+, and Ir4.y+ are identified spectroscopically, and their concentrations are quantified as a function of applied potential. The generation of Ir4.y+ states is found to be the potential-determining step for catalytic water oxidation, while H2O2 oxidation is observed to be driven by the generation of Ir4+ states. The reaction kinetics for water oxidation, determined from the optical signal decays at open circuit, accelerates from similar to 20 to <0.5 s with increasing applied potential above 1.3 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode [i.e., turnover frequencies (TOFs) per active Ir state increasing from 0.05 to 2 s(-1)]. In contrast, the reaction kinetics for H2O2 is found to be almost independent of the applied potential (increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 s(-1) over a wider potential window), indicative of a firstorder reaction mechanism. These spectroelectrochemical data quantify the increase of both the density of active Ir4.y+ states and the TOFs of these states with applied positive potential, resulting in the observed sharp turn on of catalytic water oxidation current. We reconcile these data with the broader literature while providing a unique kinetic insight into IrOx electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, indicating a first-order reaction mechanism for H2O2 oxidation driven by Ir4+ states and a higher-order reaction mechanism involving the cooperative interaction of multiple Ir4.y+ states for water oxidation.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000751835200033

In this work, we report the rational design of hollow N-doped carbon nanotube arrays embedded with confined Co nanoparticles (HCA-Co) through a facile solution-reaction and annealing process. Due to the unique integration of hollow carbon nanoarray with tiny cobalt nanoparticles, the obtained flexible HCA-Co electrode shows promising catalytic properties toward both ORR and OER that achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at small overpotential of 290 mV in OER, and demonstrates an onset potential of 0.92 V in ORR. The HCA-Co can be applied as a binder-free air-cathode for flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries, which presents a relatively high open circuit potential (1.40 V) with better cycling stability than Pt/C based battery. The HCA-Co is also utilised as cathode for solid-state Al battery, which shows a high open circuit potential (1.966 V) with better mechanical flexibility than that of Pt/C-based battery. Such flexible electrode with excellent bifunctional catalytic properties hold great promise for the application in flexible electronics.									85	5	0	0	9	0	86			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000463344800096

This inactivation of OEC was accompanied by the accumulation of inactive complexes of photosystem II (PSII), in which the reduction of primary quinone acceptor and the conversion into the closed state occurred with a low efficiency, even in the presence of 5 muM DCMU. The treatment of light-grown algal cells with hydroxylamine impaired OEC functioning, in similarity to the effect of dark incubation, but caused no accumulation of inactive PSII complexes. We conclude that the inactivation of OEC is not the cause of the inactivation of PSII complex. The decline in the efficiency of electron-transport reactions, both on the donor and acceptor sides of PSII may be related to modification of major proteins in the PS II reaction center.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1021-4437			WOS:000224764500002

However, the high overpotential that the OER requires to take place, has resulted in high costs associated with precious metals used in anodes that catalyze this reaction. Substitute elements, among them Co, have been investigated in order to decrease their price, herein, highlight Pb-Co electrodes that achieved an important decrease in the overpotential needed for the OER. Even though the electrocatalyst ability showed by the Pb-Co anode was considerably high, the current densities achieved were too low to compete with commercial anodes. Therefore, the efficiency to produce O-2 should be increased. The aim of this work was to develop a Pb-Co-Sn film, through anodic electrodeposition, that enables an efficient production of O-2 coupled with stability, low-cost and low overpotential. In order to know the morphological, microstructural and chemical composition, a full characterization of the developed film was carried out. The obtained Pb-Co-Sn film showed higher electrochemical performance than conventional Pb-Ca-Sn anodes, with an overpotential of similar to 0.27 V vs NHE at 500 Am-2, 68% lower than a conventional Pb-Ca-Sn anode.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000656909700001

To intrinsically and extrinsically improve OER performance, herein, we present a novel OER catalyst of Fe doped Co9S8@CoO aerogel with core-shell nanostructures via structural/electronic modulation strategy. The structural modulation is realized by 3D porous aerogel and core-shell nanoarchitecture which provides rich exposed active sites and guarantees effective ion diffusion and O-2 release, and the amorphous shell layer of CoO can effectively prevent the corrosion of Co9S8 by the electrolyte during OER process. The electronic modulation is realized by Fe heteroatom doping for Co9S8 and oxygen vacancies in CoO layer was caused by partial oxidation process, which facilities the transfer of electrons during OER process. These merits make Fe-doped Co9S8@CoO an efficient and stable OER catalyst: it requires only a low overpotential of 296 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) and it delivers a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) with good stability, which are even better than those of commercial RuO2.

Cyclic voltammograms obtained for bare gold evidenced no activity for OER in the potential window bellow 2.0 V-RHE, while for gold electrodes multi-cycled in the hydr(oxide) region, i.e., 1.25-1.50 V-RHE, the OER activity is high and present an onset potential of 1.55 V-RHE. Linear sweep voltammetry shows that the OER activity depends on the nature of alkali cation in the solution and also on the content of iron incorporated onto gold oxide electrodes. In situ surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detected a band at 790 cm(-1) suggesting the presence of OO- species on Au close to 1.90 V-RHE and a broader band at a relatively lower potential (1.55 V-RHE) that could be related to Fe-like species OO-, OOH and/or Fe=O that were adsorbed on gold electrode at a relatively low potential (similar to 1.55 V-RHE), such species are likely to be the reactive centers participating in the electrocatalysis of the OER in alkaline media.

FP behaviour, while central to severe-accident evaluation, impacts: evolution of the kernel oxygen potential governing in turn carbon oxidation (amoeba effect and pressurization); particle pressurization through fission-gas release from the kernel; and coating mechanical resistance via reaction with some FPs (Pd, Cs, Sr). The HFR-Eu1 bis experiment irradiated five HTR fuel pebbles containing TRISO-coated UO2 particles and went beyond current HTR specifications (e.g., central temperature of 1523 K). This study presents ceramographic and EPMA examinations of irradiated urania kernels and coatings. Significant evolutions of the kernel (grain structure, porosity, metallic-inclusion size, intergranular bubbles) as a function of temperature are shown. Results concerning FP migration are presented, e.g., significant xenon, caesium and palladium release from the kernel, molybdenum and ruthenium mainly present in metallic precipitates. The observed FP and micro-structural evolutions are interpreted and explanations proposed. The effect of high flux rate and high temperature on fission-gas behaviour, grain-size evolution and kernel swelling is discussed. Furthermore, Cs, Mo and Zr behaviour is interpreted in connection with oxygen-potential. This paper shows that combining state-of-the-art post-irradiation examination and state-of-the-art modelling fundamentally improves understanding of HTR fuel behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, facile O2-plasma activation is introduced to improve the bi-functionality via constructing nickel sulfide-oxide heterostructures. Ni3S2-NiOx supported by nickel foam delivers obviously elevated HER and OER activity in comparison with pristine Ni3S2 and recently reported NiSx-based electrocatalysts, featured by the low overpotentials for HER (104 mV) and OER (241 mV) at +/- 10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH, as well as a voltage of 1.52 V for overall water splitting. As revealed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy, on the one hand, Ni(OH)2 generated from Ni3S2 during alkaline HER accelerates water dissociation toward the gradually improved performance; on the other hand, this heterostructure undergoes extensive oxidation during OER, leading to excessive NiOOH covering on Ni3S2 and thereby declining activity. These changes are interpreted by the distinct thermodynamic relationship under specific electro-chemical conditions via density functional theory calculations. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a highly scalable 'hydrogel-organic interfacial diffusion' driven approach is utilized for direct growth of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals over a porous graphene hydrogel framework with fine structural control. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of this heterostructure reveals that, two-stage diffusion (hydrogel-organic interfacial and intra-hydrogel) control of organic ligand molecules and their interaction with the graphene surface play key roles in tunable MOF-hydrogel formation. The resulting tri-metallic MOF-hydrogel-hybrid derived porous aerogel exhibits state-of-the-art oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance metrics with excellent operational stability in alkaline medium. The overpotential required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is as low as 255 mV and a small Tafel slope of 44.3 mV dec(-1) signifies a very high rate of oxygen evolution reaction. The hydrogel-organic interfacial principle of this material could be applied to produce versatile graphene-MOF heterostructures as well as other diverse functional graphene-gel-nanohybrids (e.g. metal nanoparticles, conducting polymers) with intriguing application prospects.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000635284900027

Herein, a facile solvothermal method is put forward to synthesize three-dimensional porous cobalt ferrite and carbon nanorod hybrid network constructed by a network of carbon nanorods in which cobalt ferrite nanoparticles are uniformly embedded. The cobalt ferrite and carbon nanorod hybrid electrocatalyst delivers outstanding OER performance, especially a very low onset potential (1.49 V vs. RHE), a very low Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)), and to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) only requires a very small potential (1.56 V), which is much better than cobalt ferrite, and comparable to RuO2. Furthermore, it also displays excellent long-term stability under 25 h of chronoamperometric testing. The reason why cobalt ferrite and carbon nanorod hybrid has such superior OER performance stems from the low oxygen coordination and solid-state redox couples of cobalt ferrite, the conductive carbon nanorod skeleton and the unique three-dimensional porous nanoarchitecture, which can not only sustain the high conductivity and structural stability of the hybrid catalyst, but also facilitate the electron/ion transfer and oxygen bubble diffusion and bare more electrochemically active surface sites. This paper proposes a new scheme for the synthesis of non-noble transition metal oxide-based OER electrocatalysts with rationally designed nanoarchitecture and high efficiency.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000530236800008

Recent spectroscopic and computational studies increasingly support iron as the site of catalytic activity but differ with respect to the relevant iron redox state. A combination of hybrid periodic density functional theory calculations and spectroelectrochemical experiments elucidate the electronic structure and redox thermodynamics of Ni-only and mixed NiFe oxyhydroxide thin-film electrocatalysts. The UV/visible light absorbance of the Ni-only catalyst depends on the applied potential as metal ions in the film are oxidized before the onset of OER activity. In contrast, absorbance changes are negligible in a 25% Fe-doped catalyst up to the onset of OER activity. First-principles calculations of proton-coupled redox potentials and magnetizations reveal that the Ni-only system features oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+, followed by oxidation to a mixed Ni3+/4+ state at a potential coincident with the onset of OER activity. Calculations on the 25% Fedoped system show the catalyst is redox inert before the onset of catalysis, which coincides with the formation of Fe4+ and mixed Ni oxidation states. The calculations indicate that introduction of Fe dopants changes the character of the conduction band minimum from Ni-oxide in the Ni-only to predominantly Fe-oxide in the NiFe electrocatalyst. These findings provide a unified experimental and theoretical description of the electrochemical and optical properties of Ni and NiFe oxyhydroxide electrocatalysts and serve as an important benchmark for computational characterization of mixedmetal oxidation states in heterogeneous catalysts.									116	2	0	0	16	0	116			0027-8424			WOS:000396893600048	28265083

Nevertheless, the presence of chloride ions in seawater will cause electrode corrosion and also undergo a chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) that competes with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, highly efficient and long-term stable electrocatalysts are needed in this field. In this work, an advanced bifunctional electrocatalyst based on NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/FeOOH heterostructure nanosheets (NiFe LDH/FeOOH) was synthesized on nickel-iron foam (INF) via a simple electrodeposition method. The NiFe LDH/FeOOH electrode demonstrates excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability, which results from the strong interaction between FeOOH and NiFe LDH. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the catalytic process and also demonstrated that the NiFe LDH/FeOOH heterostructure could facilitate the formation of active NiOOH species in the reaction. The obtained NiFe LDH/FeOOH catalyst displays low overpotentials of 181.8 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 286.2 mV at 100 mA center dot cm(-2) for OER in the 1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte. Furthermore, it also exhibits a low voltage of 1.55 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and works steadily for 105 h at 100 mA center dot cm(-2) for overall alkaline simulated seawater splitting. This work will afford a valid strategy for designing a non-noble metal catalyst for seawater splitting.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000720776700052	34705457

Herein, we proposed the design and fabrication of a WO3/alpha-Fe2O3 core-shell heterojunction structure, aiming at alleviating the severe mismatch between the relatively long light penetration depth and the extremely short holes diffusion length in alpha-Fe2O3. The WO3 nanoarray underlayer is grown directly on the FTO substrate, serving as an effective electron transfer layer and additional light absorber. The alpha-Fe2O3 layer is further prepared via spin-coating and a subsequent calcination process as a thin and uniform shell. The loading amount was regulated with different spin coating times of the precursor. The optimized WO3/alpha-Fe2O3 core-shell nanoarrays display an excellent performance with lower onset potential of 0.65 V vs. RHE and increased photocurrent response of 1.29 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE, much superior than the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 or WO3 photoanode. Characterizations demonstrate that both improved light absorption and formation of heterojunction account for the excellent performance. After coating a NiFe-LDH co-catalyst layer, the oxygen evolution reaction is further enhanced, and high stability is achieved, benefiting from the efficient charge carrier generation, promoted charge separation in the semiconductor and the rapid consumption of holes for surface reaction.									18	1	0	0	0	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000456207200034

Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have recently emerged as excellent energy conversion and storage materials due to their highly active surface sites, electrical conductivity, thermal and structural stability. TMPs exhibit numerous other desirable properties, like hardness and chemical stability, which result from the presence of strong M - P bonds in the molecules. In this work, comprehensive review of recent advancements in research concerning TMPs and their applications in the area of energy conversion and storage was conducted. Additionally, the frequently employed synthetic strategies for the production of TMPs were investigated. Particularly, hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), dye-sensitized solar cells for energy conversion and storage, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors were examined. TMPs display remarkable electrochemical behavior due to the synergistic effects of various compositions and surface structures. Moreover, the M-centers and P-sites possess high electrocatalytic activity. The P-sites of phosphides are negatively charged; thus, they attract protons, enhancing the HER/OER activities. Eventhough platinum-based electrocatalysts perform best in HER, their bifunctional properties have not been extensively studied due to poor OER activities. In energy storage, TMPs used as efficient and stable electrodes owing to their low charge-discharge potentials, high theoretical specific capacities, and a decreased ion-diffusion pathway. Finally, the challenges, future perspectives in the area of energy are discussed and several approaches for the improvement of multifunctional TMPs are proposed.									54	0	0	0	15	0	54			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000608700500004

Current results reflect the ascending order (Pd-MoSSe < Pt-MoSSe < Ir-MoSSe) of stability and binding strength as well as the tunable electronic properties of Janus MoSSe ML by anchoring single Pd, Pt and Ir atoms. Pd- and Pt-MoSSe exhibit excellent bifunctional catalytic performance, especially the former having lower overpotentials 0.43 and 0.50 V for ORR and OER, which are better than the well-known Pt (1 1 1) (0.45 V) and IrO2 (0.56 V) electrocatalysts, respectively. The adsorption nature for NO, CO and NH3 molecules changes from physisorption (on pristine MoSSe) to chemisorption (on Ir-MoSSe), especially for NO and CO molecules due to their ultra-low adsorption energies (-3.72 and -2.91 eV, respectively). Thus, Pd- and Pt-MoSSe (particularly the former) may act as promising highly-efficient ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts, and Ir-MoSSe may serve as a potential sensitive harmful gas detector for NO and CO molecules.

Herein, a facile and general route is developed to prepare various non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts via NH3 center dot H2O treatment (NT) on Ni foam (NF) (M-NT/NF, M = Co, Ni, Fe, Mn, Cu). The morphology and compositions of the obtained catalysts could be tuned via solvothermal process with NH3 center dot H2O, and then optimizing the active sites exposure and effectively change the reaction kinetics of the electrocatalytic reaction. Moreover, the substrate of Ni foam is in favor of electrolyte transfer and release of produced gases. Then, the obtain Co-NT/NF, composed of metallic Co and Co(OH)(2), exhibits excellent catalytic performance for HER with low overpotential of 178 mV@10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1), which is rarely reported for HER. For OER, only a low overpotential of 226 mV is required to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the reported electrocatalysts present negligible current density loss during long-term stability measurement, demonstrating robust nanostructure feature of the prepared catalysts. This work opens a facile and efficient avenue to design bi-funtional electrocatalyst coupling with outstanding catalytic performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Two-dimensional (2D) metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets have recently emerged as a novel class of efficient electrocatalysts for OER, due to a high specific surface area, ultrasmall thickness and abundance of active sites. Here, we summarize recent progress in the preparation and characterization of 2D transition metal-based MOFs (e. g. Ni, Co and Cu), as well as their composites and derivatives, including metals/alloys, metal oxides/chalcogenides and metal phosphides/hydroxides, as OER electrocatalysts reported over the past several years. Design principles and preparation routes are presented. The performance of the electrocatalysts is directly compared in terms of overpotential (eta) (thermodynamics) and electrocatalytic current density (kinetics), as well as operational stability (economics). Many of these materials exhibit superior catalytic activity compared to the noble metal-based catalysts such as RuO2(eta<300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), and considerable stability with negligible decay with operation over several hours to days. Challenges and perspectives of applying 2D MOFs and their derivatives for OER electrocatalysis are also discussed.									17	3	0	0	0	0	17			2196-0216			WOS:000579466000001

In this work, a Ru-based high entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst, RuNiMoCrFeOx nanoparticles (similar to 6 nm), loaded onto carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was synthesized by a solvent-free microwave method. By optimising its composition, we find that the RuNiMoCrFeOx/CNT catalyst shows high performance in 0.5 M H2SO4, with the overpotential of the HEO being only 219 mV (better than the 280 mV of commercial RuO2) at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope reaching 47 mV dec(-1). It is worth noting that this high entropy oxide (HEO) can operate at a high current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for up to 100 hours. The isotopic gas detection and electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments show that the OER tends to proceed through the LOM, and the high conformational entropy stabilizes the involvement of lattice oxygen in acidic solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000865272600001

Photo-, photoelectro-, and electrocatalytic reactions are indeed powerful tools to help us to embrace bright future. Especially, some gas-involved reactions are extremely useful to change our life environments from energy systems to liquid fuels and cost-effective products, such as H-2 evolution (H-2 production), O-2 evolution/reduction, CO2 reduction, N-2 reduction (or N-2 fixation) reactions. We can provide fuel cells clean H-2 for electric vehicles from H Z evolution reaction (HER), at the same time, we also need highly efficient O-2 reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells for improving the reaction kinetics. Moreover, we can get the clean oxidant O-2 from water through O-2 evolution reaction (OER), and carry out some reactions without posing any pollution to reaction systems. Furthermore, we can translate the greenhouse gas CO2 into useful liquid fuels through CO2 reduction reaction (CRR). Last but not the least, we can get ammonia from N-2 reduction reaction (NRR), which can decrease energy input compared to the traditional Hubble process. These reactions, such as HER, ORR, OER, CRR and NRR could be realized through solar-, photoelectro- and electro-assisted ways. For them, the catalysts used play crucial roles in determining the efficiency and kinds of products, so we should consider the efficiency of catalysts. However, the cost, synthetic methods of catalysts should also be considered. Nowadays, significant progress has been achieved, however, many challenges still exist, reaction systems, catalysts underlying mechanisms, and so on. As extremely active fields, we should pay attention to them. Under the background, it has motivated us to contribute with a roadmap on 'Gas-Involved Photo- and Electro-Catalysis'.

However, it is still challenging to synthesize 2D layered high-entropy materials through a bottom-up soft chemistry method, due to the difficulty of mixing and assembling multiple elements in 2D layers. Here, we report a simple polyol process for the synthesis of a series of 2D layered high-entropy transition metal (Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) hydroxides (HEHs), involving the hydrolysis and inorganic polymerization of metal-containing species in ethylene glycol media. The as-synthesized HEHs demonstrate 2D layered structures with interlayer distances ranging from 0.860 to 0.987 nm and homogeneous elemental distribution of designed equimolar stoichiometry in the layers. These 2D HEHs exhibit a low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in a 0.1 M KOH electrolyte for the oxygen evolution reaction. Superparamagnetic spinel-type high-entropy nanoparticles can also be obtained by annealing these HEHs. Our polyol approach creates opportunities for synthesizing low-dimensional high-entropy materials with promising properties and applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2516-0230			WOS:000794978700001	36134132

Herein, MoFe-codoped Ni3S2/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets with a sample size area of 200 cm(2) are established on Ni foam via a facial hydrothermal method. It is found that Fe3+ and MoO42- are effectively doped into the Ni3S2/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets that are composed by heazlewoodite Ni3S2 and beta-Ni(OH)(2) nanocrystals. Based on the systematic study on the non-, Fe-, Mo-, and MoFe-doped Ni3S2/Ni(OH)(2) composites, it is revealed that Fe3+ and MoO42- play important roles in reducing the interfacial charge transfer and increasing the electrochemical active surface area, respectively. When doping at a MoFe molar ratio of 5/3, the synergistic effect of Fe and Mo leads to an optimum OER property with low overpotentials of eta(100) (263 mV) and eta(500) (301 mV), Tafel plot of 52 mV dec(-1), and long durability for at least 24 h. An effective strategy for high-efficiency, long-durability, and nonprecious OER electrocatalysts with promising applications is provided.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000483721900001		
J	TADA, H; SAITO, Y; KAWAHARA, H								PHOTODEPOSITION OF PRUSSIAN BLUE ON TIO2 PARTICLES								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				138	1			140	144		10.1149/1.2085524				JAN 1991	1991	It was found that the precipitation of Prussian blue take place uniformly on TiO2 particles in an aqueous ferric-ferri-cyanide solution, accompanied by oxygen evolution, through irradiation of a high pressure mercury arc. Chemical analysis and x-ray diffraction measurements indicated that it consists of a crystalline "insoluble Prussian blue" [Fe4(3+)(Fe(II)(CN)6)3]. The pH of the solution decreased and the amount of O2 increased as the photodeposition of Prussian blue proceeded. Also, electrophoretic measurements suggested that Fe3+...Fe(CN)6(3-) complex adsorbs on the TiO2 particles in the reaction solution. In view of the material balance of the reaction and the results of the electrophoretic measurements, a possible mechanism of the Prussian blue photodeposition was proposed.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0013-4651			WOS:A1991EQ83100021

In this study, we actualized in situ growth of Co3O4 nanoneedles on titanium (Ti) mesh (denoted as Co3O4@Ti) by a simple combination of hydrothermal approach and subsequently calcination treatment under relatively low temperatures. The as-prepared Co3O4@Ti samples were evaluated as anodes for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte. It demonstrates that the optimized Co3O4@Ti electrode displayed good OER activity with a small overpotential of 416 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), which is on a par with commercial RuO2 catalyst (overpotential of 403 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)). The satisfactory OER performance of Co3O4@Ti electrode is largely attributed to the seamless integration of conductive Ti mesh substrate and the direct growth of Co3O4 nanoneedles on Ti mesh with sufficient active sites. This study suggests the potential application of Co3O4@Ti electrode as preeminent OER catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000687516600001

They offer the synergetic effect between different elements and structural modification to enhance the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and conductivity. In this study, efficient nonprecious bimetallic electrocatalysts of Mn1-xCux oxide (0.15 <= x <= 0.75) have been synthesized using a simple and cost-effective electrodeposition technique. The effect of compositional ratios between Mn and Cu on the electrochemical properties has been systematically investigated. The dramatic change of morphology upon composition variation suggests the alteration of ECSA, which is an important factor for electrocatalysis. The optimized Mn0.50Cu0.50 catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 291 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 54.6 mV dec(-1). It showed ultra-high stability at a very high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. The enhanced catalytic activity of Mn0.50Cu0.50 electrocatalyst is associated with the enhanced ECSA, formation of porous morphology, which facilitates the diffusion coefficient, and enhanced electronic conductivity. Overall, Mn-Cu is one of the best capable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction, which confirmed abundant potential in realistic applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000717951600001

However, the OER performance needs further improvement and the real active sites remain exclusive. Herein, the effect of ligands on the performance of MOFs and the real active sites of each MOFs were explored. Specifically, three Ni based metal organic frames (Ni-MOFs) with different ligands including formic acid (FA), 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic (BTC) were prepared by a solvothermal method. The morphology, specific surface area, porosity, wettability, electrochemically surface area (ECSA) of each Ni-MOFs were tested. However, none of them could be well correlated to the OER performance except the content of Ni(OH)(2) on the surface from XPS test. Moreover, the OER performance of each Ni-MOF could be improved by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronopotentiometry (CP). The morphology and composition of each Ni-MOF before and after electrochemical activation further reveal the real active sites of three Ni-MOFs investigated here were Ni(OH)(2). These results were expected to provide useful information for designing more excellent OER electrocatalysts based on MOFs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Still, challenges remain due to the inadequate activity and stability of the OER catalyst. Here, we report a cost-effective and stable manganese oxybromide (Mn7.5O10Br3) catalyst exhibiting an excellent OER activity in acidic electrolytes, with an overpotential of as low as 295 +/- 5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Mn7.5O10Br3 maintains good stability under operating conditions for at least 500 h. In situ Raman spectroscopy, X ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations confirm that a self-oxidized surface with enhanced electronic transmission capacity forms on Mn7.5O10Br3 and is responsible for both the high catalytic activity and long-term stability during catalysis. The development of Mn7.5O10Br3 as an OER catalyst provides crucial insights into the design of non-noble metal electrocatalysts for water oxidation.While acidic water splitting offers a renewable means to obtain renewable hydrogen fuel, the catalysts needed to oxidize water often require expensive noble metals. Here, authors show manganese oxyhalides as acidic oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000788852000034	35484271

Evolution of the surface properties of CB during the reaction was investigated to elucidate the mechanism of the variation in the catalytic activity and evaluate the carbon deposited on CB as a potential carbonaceous product. Kinetic analysis successfully quantified the variation in the catalytic activity by using the relative modification coefficient to consider the degree of carbon deposition. Elemental analysis revealed that the variation in the catalytic characteristics was not influenced by oxygen-containing functional groups except during the initial stage of the reaction. Textural evolution during the reaction was measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherms, and surface microstructural development was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The change in the surface area exposed in the reaction field correlated well with the varying catalytic behavior after the initial deactivation stage. A hypothesis concerning the correlation between the variation in the catalytic activity and the textural properties was proposed. Furthermore, development of a remarkable mesoporous surface structure on CB during the reaction was demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This Communication reports the recent finding that room-temperature treatment of CoO nanowire array on Ti mesh by NaBH4 in alkaline media leads to in situ development of Co-B nanoparticles on nanowire surface. The resulting self-supported Co-B@CoO nanoarray behaves as a 3D bifunctional electrocatalyst with high activity and durability for both HER (<17% current density degradation after 20 h electrolysis) and OER (<14% current density degradation after 20 h electrolysis) with the need of the overpotentials of 102 and 290 mV to drive 50 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH, respectively. Moreover, its two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer also shows remarkably high durability and only demands a cell voltage of 1.67 V to deliver 50 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current with a current density retention of 81% after 20 h electrolysis. This work provides a promising methodology for the designing and fabricating of metal-boride based nanoarray as a high-active water-splitting catalyst electrode for applications.									208	18	0	0	12	0	212			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000408012900006	28656681

To enhance the performance of the photocatalytic oxygen-evolution reaction, enriched oxygenous-type carbon quantum dots (CQD) were combined with oxygen-deficient ZnO@H-ZnO1-x homojunctions for the first time. Specifically, hydrogenation created an unstoichiometric H-ZnO1-x surface through oxygen vacancies, which were responsible for the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Zn centers to drive the photoelectrochemical reaction by precise regulation of the charge density, valence-band edge, atomic geometric structure and electronic structure. The enriched photohole reservoir in carboxyl-conjugated CQD was a great benefit for super-rapid charge tunnels, thereby governing the rate of internal and interfacial charge separation and transport in the multijunction. Accordingly, the CQD/H-ZnO1-x/ZnO photoanodes showed a photoactivity enhanced five-fold relative to bare ZnO NR and maintained that high performance for 24 h of operation. Comprehensive analyses, involving electrochemical measurements, time-resolved photoluminescence, X-ray absorption spectra in situ and calculations with density-functional theory were undertaken to elucidate the underlying mechanism of enhancement and the route of directional charge transport as well as the interfacial charge dynamics over the CQD/H-ZnO1-x/ZnO photoelectrode. These findings provide a new track towards photoelectrodes that could yield not only strikingly enhanced photocatalysis but also satisfied stability for realistic application.									9	2	0	0	0	0	10			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000623245500001

In the traditional fabrication of such materials, metal ions are reduced into metallic particles, which make it hard to control oxidation state of metals. In this work, we report tunable oxidation state of Co in CoOx@N-doped graphene simply by changing the pyrolysis temperature of Co3O4/polyaniline. Under high temperature, polyaniline decompose and release various organic gases, which can partially reduce Co3O4 and serve as gaseous precursors for the in-situ growth of graphene in the meantime. The balance of these two reactions is crucial to control the oxidation state of Co. Thus, its catalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction can be easily tuned by inner CoOx core with different electron structure.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000449683100076

After treatment with low concentrations of hydroxylamine the corresponding flash patterns showed a delay of two S-state transitions of the water-splitting enzyme S compared to untreated samples. The delay is still observed 10 h after removal of unreacted hydroxylamine by gel filtration. This indicates a chemical reaction of hydroxylamine with the water-splitting enzyme in the dark. The consequences for the possible states of manganese (as carrier of redox equivalents) and of water in the quarternary S cycle are discussed.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21			0006-3002			WOS:A1991GE27300009

In heterogeneous catalysis, a strategy with a second active site has been developed to improve OER catalytic performance. Here we propose the design of dual-active sites consisting of two adjacent TMN4(OH) (TM = Cr/Mn/Fe/Co/Ni/Cu) sites confined to a nanotube and use first-principles calculations to investigate their OER mechanisms. It was found that the OER pathway including the chemical step of O-2 generation from direct O-O coupling (*O + *O -> 2* + O-2, Delta G(5)) can be carried out on the TMN4(OH) dual-active sites. It associates with a newly linear OER activity trend function, with Delta G(5) as the descriptor. Importantly, the potential-independent process should occur under mild conditions, which limits Delta G(5) to be relatively negative. This law of thermodynamic feasibility gives an optimal overpotential (0.18 V) for the FeN4(OH) dual-active sites. Besides, the Delta G(5) descriptor is only related to the binding energy of *O, implying a facile route to achieve optimal activity. Our proposed dual-active-sites catalysis provides new insights into the fundamental understanding of OER mechanisms and theoretical guidelines for the accelerated discovery of efficient OER catalysts.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000581598800010

This is because an OER process usually involves multiple electron-transfer and reaction steps; these result in large overpotentials and significant energy loss. Thus, a smart design of highly efficient, stable and cheap OER electrocatalysts is important for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and reduction of water splitting procedure cost. In this work, we find that a thin crystalline oxyhydroxide layer has been in situ electrochemically formed on the surfaces of conductive nickel-iron disulfide nanostructures; such a heterostructure takes advantage of highly catalytically active oxyhydroxide surfaces and excellent conductivity of the interior disulfide phase. This results in a very low overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is among the best OER catalysts in alkaline electrolyte ever reported. The crystalline oxyhydroxide layer can effectively prevent the disulfide core from further oxidation, maintains the core-shell structure of the catalyst and is considered to be critical for stable and efficient OER performances.									133	13	0	0	5	1	134			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395926100011

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are regarded as the highly promising electrocatalysts to promote the OER kinetics. However, the closely stacking layered structure of pristine bulk LDHs restricts the exposure of electrocatalytically active sites, and it remains a great challenge to find an efficient strategy to exfoliate the bulk LDHs into ultrathin and stable nanosheets with increased surface area and exposed active sites. Herein, a novel Ostwald ripening driven exfoliation (ORDE) of NiFe LDHs has been achieved in situ on the electrodes by spontaneously self-etching and redepositing via a simple hydrothermal treatment without the assistance of any exfoliating reagent or surfactant. The thermodynamically driven Ostwald ripening has been expanded to the exfoliation of two-dimensional layered materials for the first time. Compared with conventional exfoliation methods, this ORDE is a time-saving and green strategy that avoids the serious adsorption of surfactant molecules. The ORDE of NiFe LDHs is accomplished in situ on a Cu mesh electrode, which not only exhibits excellent electrical contact between LDHs catalyst and electrodes but also prevents the restacking of the exfoliated LDHs. As a result, the exfoliated ultrathin, clean, and vertically aligned NiFe nanosheets with much higher surface area and numerous exposed active edges and sites demonstrated significantly enhanced OER performances with low overpotential of 292 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability for more than 60 h, as well as remarkable flexibility. Additionally, bulk Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on Ni foams have also been exfoliated by a similar mechanism, indicating this ORDE strategy can be widely extended to other 2D layered materials for novel applications.									37	3	0	0	3	0	37			1944-8244			WOS:000454751600035	30508374

A special Co(II)-Salen-organic framework was prepared as the precursor, which isolated a few Co(II) ions with thick aromatic polymer pore walls. These Co(II) ions were thermally converted into fine Co nanoparticles highly dispersing in porous nitrogen-doped carbons. The as-prepared Co@N-Cs showed efficient electrocatalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), together with better catalytic durability. In alkaline solution, the optimized Co@N-C-800 exhibited a positive ORR half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.85 V, superior to the benchmark Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.84 V). It also had a low overpotential (E-eta) of 0.35 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, close to IrO2 (E-eta = 0.36 V) catalysts. It could be also utilized as the outstanding air electrode materials in Zn-air batteries, which exhibited higher peak power density and cycling stability than Pt/C-based counterpart. By this unique soft-confinement conversion of Co(II)-Salen-COFs, the derived Co@N-Cs possessed the optimized local strcutures (high porosity and graphization degree) and the multiple active sites especially including high-density Co nanoparticle-activitated carbon layers, which contributed to their impressive trifunational electrocatalytic properities.

The position of the reagents in the test tube permits the continuous measurement of oxygen evolution from the time of mixing, without the need to stop the reaction by the addition of acid after each incubation time. The enzyme activity is reported as K-Hb, i.e., mg hydrogen peroxide decomposed per second per gram of hemoglobin (s(-1) g Hb(-1)). The value obtained for catalase activity in 28 samples of hemolyzed human blood was 94.4 +/- 6.17 mg H2O2 s(-1) g Hb(-1). The results obtained were precise and consistent, indicating that this rapid, simple and inexpensive method could be useful for research and routine work.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0100-879X	1414-431X		WOS:000082869000006	10464384

Among them, MOFs with motif M-N-X or analogues are expected to be promising active electrode materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Contrary to bulk MOFs, two-dimensional (2D) MOFs usually have high surface areas, fully exposed active sites, and specific electrical properties. Herein, we constructed 2D Ni-3 (hexaimino-triphenylene)(2) [Ni-3(HITP)(2)] films on the electrode surface by utilizing the bottom-up liquid/liquid/gel tri-phase interface system and explored their potential applications in electrocatalytic OER. The thickness of the 2D Ni-3(HITP)(2) films can be controlled to be about 5 nm. The prepared 2D Ni-3(HITP)(2) films had oriented polycrystalline character and showed excellent performance in OER. A current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for 3-layer Ni-3(HITP)(2) film electrodes was obtained at 1.62 V, which was 20 mV lower than that for the commercial Iro(2) catalyst. Electrochemical tests and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that better OER performance of 3-layer Ni-3(HITP)(2) films was ascribed to their high electrochemically active surface area, better kinetic process, and fast ion diffusion and transport.									11	0	0	0	1	0	12			0743-7463			WOS:000548555400040	32513012

The prepared LCFO@rGO composite was explored as a cathode catalyst for LiO2 batteries, resulting in an outstanding discharge capacity (ca. 7088.2 mAh g(-1)) at the first cycle. Moreover, a high stability of the O-2-cathode with the LCFO@rGO catalyst was achieved over 56 cycles under the capacity limit of 500 mAh g(-1) with a rate of 200 mA g(-1), as compared to the Ketjenblack carbon and LCFO NWs. The enhanced electrochemical performance suggests that these hybrid composites of perovskite LCFO NWs with rGO nanosheets could be a perspective bifunctional catalyst for the cathode oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in the development of next-generation LiO2 battery cathodes.									64	5	0	0	2	0	65			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000425572700030	29345459

Its vicinal Au(332) = Au[6(111) x (111)] surface has been chosen to examine the role of a small density of steps as active sites. The increase of the average surface energy, caused by the presence of steps on the Au(332) face, causes a slight shift of the half-wave potential to a more positive value, compared to the Au(111). The reaction on Au(111) is kinetically hindered in the whole potential region up to hydrogen evolution. The presence of steps on the Au(332) face apparently causes the kinetic limitations to be lifted. The kinetics of oxygen reduction on the Au(332) face in alkaline solution has been studied by means of a rotating disc-ring method. The mechanism of the reaction has been found the simplest among all the faces of Au investigated so far. In the kinetic and mixed control regions the reduction proceeds through the simplest 2e-series pathway. At large overpotentials, a 4e-reduction occurs, whose extent depends on the potential, with a surface diffusion of HO2a- as a rate determining step. No splitting of the O-O bond has been found. A map of the reaction pathways for the whole potential range of oxygen reduction has been constructed.									30	2	0	0	1	0	31			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:A1994NP32100017

In this study, we investigated the topmost layer of single-domain (0 0 1)-oriented AgCoO2 epitaxial thin film for potential use as an OER catalyst. The thin film was confirmed to possess OER activity at a level comparable to the catalyst in powder form. Atomic scattering spectroscopy revealed the topmost layer to be composed of CoO6 octahedra. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed that the oxidation of Co at the surface did not change under different potentials, which suggests that there is no valence fluctuation of Co in the stable CoO6 octahedral structure. However, the oxidation number of Co at the surface was lower than that in the bulk. Our density functional theoretical calculations also showed the Co atoms at the surface to have a slightly higher electron occupancy than those in the bulk, and suggests that the unoccupied t(2g) states of Co at the surface have an influence on OER activity.

The catalyst was later mixed with Pt-Black and supported on the Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO), synthesized through the same colloidal method. ATO was investigated as a possible catalyst support in an electrode of a regenerative fuel cell (URFC), where Pt-IrO2 was used as the catalyst for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions. The morphology and composition of the ATO support was investigated through transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (including Rietveld Refinement), BET analysis, and X-ray fluorescence. An ATO support was obtained with a highly homogeneous distribution and crystal sizes, measuring approximately 4-6 nm.The Pt-IrO2/ATO material was deposited on a Nafion 115 membrane with 0.5 mg cm(-2) of catalyst loading. Pt/Vulcan XC-72 (30 wt. %, E-TEK) was used as the catalyst in the H-2 compartment with a Pt loading of 0.4 mg cm(-2). The electrochemical activity of the Pt IrO2/ATO for oxygen evolution/reduction in the URFC system was investigated by AC-impedance spectroscopy, linear voltammetry, and chronoamperometry techniques. The maximum mass current activity was 1118 A g(-1) at 1.8 V in proton-exchange membrane water electrolyser mode (PEMWE) and 565 A g(-1) at 0.3 V in proton-exchange membrane fuel cell mode (PEMFC), both at 80 degrees C. The value of the round-trip energy efficiency was approximately 48% at 50 A g(-1). Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, three-dimensional (3D) amorphous NiFeIrx/Ni core-shell nanowire@nanosheets (NW@NSs) are successfully synthesized through a facile one-step reduction process with atomically isolated Ir atoms anchored on an NiFe-based core. By taking advantage of their unique structure and composition, the resultant NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs have a high electrocatalytic activity for OER which can deliver current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 200 and 250 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively. It is worth noting that NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs exhibit outstanding long-term stability over 12 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations also reveal that the intrinsic activity of the resultant NiFeIrx/Ni NW@NSs is significantly enhanced upon the addition of Ir single atoms, highlighting the critical role of the synergistic effect between Ir single atoms and the support. Due to their easy synthesis and superior electrochemical performance, the newly designed nanostructures may find promising potential applications in water splitting and other related fields.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000509428300023	31891249

However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high-temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt-Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre-doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L1(2)-ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (<6 wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000703001500001	34605065

The results show that the epoxy system with a stoichiometric ratio of 0.7 had a better resistance to thermal-oxidation, which might be resulted from the strong post-curing ability of the epoxy coating. The density of the 3 coatings after crosslinking treatment exhibited little change. Thermal aging was mainly derived from the reaction of the oxygen atoms with nitrogen atom on the cross-linked network nodes, while amide and carboxyl groups were the main oxidation products. Therewith the presence of acid groups might facilitate the fracture of molecular chains.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1002-6495			INSPEC:14474518

However, the generation of active sites for solar-dirven nitrogen fixation not only limits the fundamental understanding of the relationship among light absorption, charge transfer, and catalytic efficiency but also influences the photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report two-dimensional boron-doped niobic acid nanosheets with oxygen vacancies (B-V-o-HNbO3 NSs) for efficient N-2 photofixation in the absence of any scavengers and cocatalysts. Impressively, B-V-o-HNbO3 NS as a model catalyst achieves the enhanced ammonia evolution rate of 170 mu mol g(cat)(-1) h(-1) in pure water under visible-light irradiation. The doublet coupling representing (NH4+)-N-15 in an isotopic labeling experiment and in situ infrared spectra confirm the reliable ammonia generation. The experimental analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the strong synergy of boron dopant and oxygen vacancy regulates band structure of niobic acid, facilitates photogenerated charge transfer, reduces free energy barriers, accelerates reaction kinetics, and promotes the high rates of ammonia evolution. This work provides a general strategy to design active photocatalysts toward solar N-2 conversion.									11	1	0	0	0	0	10			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000747115200062	34708651

The resultant NiIr@N-C/NF displays excellent electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 mKOH, with low overpotentials of 32 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for the HER and 329 mV at 50 mA cm(-2)for the OER.

The F- promotes anodic dissolution and inhibits oxygen reduction, resulting in the decrease of cathodic current density. The corrosion process presents a two-step reaction mechanism, and the influence mechanism of fluoride in different acids is different.

In this review, we summarize alternative anodic chemistries being considered as a means of lowering the amount of electricity required to produce hydrogen at the cathode, or simply driving chemistry that forms products more valuable than oxygen at the anode. The potential for an organic oxidation reaction to instead occur at the anode presents a new opportunity for the production of value-added chemical products from cheap, readily available and, in some cases, renewable feedstocks.									40	1	0	0	2	0	40			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700003

However, to substitute fossil fuels, large amounts of pure water are necessary, scarce in many world regions. In this work, we fabricate efficient and earth-abundant electrodes, study the challenges of using real seawater, and propose an electrode regeneration method to face undesired salt deposition. Ni-Mo-Fe trimetallic electrocatalyst is deposited on non-expensive graphitic carbon felts both for hydrogen (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in seawater and alkaline seawater. Cl- pitting and the chlorine oxidation reaction are suppressed on these substrates and alkalinized electrolyte. Precipitations on the electrodes, mainly CaCO3, originating from seawater-dissolved components have been studied, and a simple regeneration technique is proposed to rapidly dissolve undesired deposited CaCO3 in acidified seawater. Under alkaline conditions, Ni-Mo-Fe-based catalyst is found to reconfigure, under cathodic bias, into Ni-Mo-Fe alloy with a cubic crystalline structure and Ni : Fe(OH)(2) redeposits whereas, under anodic bias, it is transformed into a follicular Ni:FeOOH structure. High productivities over 300 mA cm(-2) and voltages down to 1.59 V@10 mA cm(-2) for the overall water splitting reaction have been shown, and electrodes are found stable for over 24 h without decay in alkaline seawater conditions and with energy efficiency higher than 61.5 % which makes seawater splitting promising and economically feasible.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000661958200001	33826792

In the growth process of both microalgae the alkalization of their culture medium was observed. And simultaneously it was shown that at increasing NaCl salting of cultural medium its acidification occurs. At alkalization and acidification of Chlorella medium the increase of heat production and respiration rates were observed. At alkalization and acidification of Dunaliella culture the adverse effect of decreasing heat production rate was observed. Acidification of culture medium of both algae led to short-term and sharp increase of photosynthesis measured by polarography and photomicrocalorimeter.					16th ISBC Conference16th ISBC Conference	MAY 31-JUN 03, 2010MAY 31-JUN 03, 2010		Univ Santiago Compostela, Lugo, SPAINUniv Santiago Compostela, Lugo, SPAIN	7	0	1	0	4	0	9			1388-6150			WOS:000288512500027

The optimal catalyst Co0.8Ru0.2Ox@NC composed of the N-doped carbon (NC) shell and the endohedral hybrid of metal/metal oxide exhibits excellent catalytic activities in alkaline media with a low overpotential of 36 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction, 278 mV for oxygen evolution reaction, and an ultralow potential of -19 mV for hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) at 10 mA cm(-2). When used as both cathode and anode catalysts for overall water splitting, Co0.8Ru0.2Ox@NC drives 10/500 mA cm(-2) with a cell voltage as low as 1.55/1.86 V and maintains long-term stability at 500 mA cm(-2). Moreover, for HzOR-assisted electrochemical water splitting (EWS), the Co0.8Ru0.2Ox@NC-based electrode couple requires ultralow cell voltages of merely 79/674 mV to deliver 10/100 mA cm(-2) with excellent long-term durability at 100 mA cm(-2). The success of the present electrocatalyst shall be attributed to the combined effect of minor RuOx incorporation and carbon encapsulation, which results in not only enhanced catalyst conductivity and charge transfer kinetics but also surface-enriched active sites and improved intrinsic catalytic activity. Thus, our work may pave a new opportunity for rational design and facile synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts for EWS operated with high current density or low power input.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000562983600024

The microstructural properties of the lignite and residues were examined by FT-IR,XRD,XPS and Raman,respectively. The results indicate that aliphatic functional groups were consumed during combustion,while oxygen-containing groups and aromatic structure were consumed and generated alternatively. The proportion of C-C /C-H structure decreased after increasing,while the content of carbon-oxygen structure was increased following decrease. The aromaticity of residues increased and I_D /I_G increased before decrease,while I_S /I_G decreased before increase. This indicated that graphitization transformation degree of lignite obviously increased during combustion,especially in the late stage of reaction.			对胜利脱灰褐煤的燃烧反应性进行了测试,并利用FT-IR、XPS、XRD和Raman等对不同条件下的未反应残留物进行了表征,以分析胜利脱灰褐煤在燃烧过程中微结构演变特性。结果表明,在燃烧反应过程中,煤样的脂肪族官能团不断消耗,碳氧官能团和芳烃骨架的消耗与生成交替进行,褐煤表面C-C /C-H键合结构所占比例先增加后减少,碳-氧键合结构所占比例先减小后增加,未反应残留物的芳香度不断升高,褐煤的石墨缺陷指数先增加后降低,而脂肪族侧链指数则呈现先减少后增加的变化规律,表明随着燃烧反应进行对褐煤未反应残留物的石墨化程度逐渐提高,特别是在燃烧反应后期,石墨化程度显著提高。						1	4	0	0	0	0	4			0253-2409			CSCD:6132625

Herein, an interface metal-to-metal coupling strategy was proposed for constructing electrochemically stable and acid resistant Co-coupled MoO2-based hierarchical nanospheres (HNs-Co), which were synthesizedviaanin situconfinement reaction followed by an interface engineering process. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure composed of carbon-based nanosheets embedded with rich nano/sub-nano MoO(2)and the strong electronic coupling between Co and Mo, the well-constructed HNs-Co manifested outstanding ORR catalytic activities along with robust catalytic stability in both alkaline and acidic media compared to reported precious metal-free Mo-based ORR catalysts. The half-wave potential of HNs-Co evaluated in alkaline medium is comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C catalyst and is the highest in acidic medium among the reported values for precious metal-free Mo-based materials. The strong coupling between Co and Mo not only decreased the oxygen binding energy of MoO2, benefiting ORR catalytic activity, but also enhanced the stability of some Co moieties in acidic medium for maintaining the catalytic capacity of HNs-Co. Moreover, HNs-Co manifested considerable HER catalysis with low overpotential even after 5000 cycle scans. This work highlighted the importance of interface tuning for boosting the ORR and HER catalytic activity of Mo-based materials, which can be extended to the rational design of other precious metal-free materials for efficient energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000575019100024

However, the development of low-cost, highly efficient OER electrocatalysts by a simple method that can be used for industrial application on a large scale is still a huge challenge. Recently, high entropy alloy (HEA) has acquired extensive attention, which may provide answers to the current dilemma. Here, we report bulk Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10, which is prepared by 3D printing on a large scale, as electrocatalyst for OER with high catalytic performance. Especially, an easy approach, corrosion engineering, is adopted for the first time to build an active layer of honeycomb nanostructures on its surface, leading to ultrahigh OER performance with an overpotential of 247 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 63 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability up to 60 h at 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The excellent catalytic activity mainly originates from: (1) the binder-free self-supported honeycomb nanostructures and multi-component hydroxides, which improve intrinsic catalytic activity, provide rich active sites, and reduce interfacial resistance; and (2) the diverse valence states for multiple active sites to enhance the OER kinetics. Our findings show that corrosion engineering is a novel strategy to improve the bulk HEA catalytic performance. We expect that this work would open up a new avenue to fabricate large-scale HEA electrocatalysts by 3D printing and corrosion engineering for industrial applications.

Here, a rational design of a self-supported hierarchical nanocomposite, composed of Ir02@Ni0 nanoparticle-built porous nanoflake arrays vertically growing on nickel foam, is proposed, which is demonstrated as a versatile strategy to achieve improved OER activity, remarkable long-term stability, and significantly reduced loading of Ir02 (0.62 atom %). Impressively, the resultant catalyst drives a steady OER current density of 10 mA cm-2, requiring 278 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte for 25 h and outmaneuvring commercial IrO2pC with much higher mass loading. Further electrochemical investigation and mechanism analysis disclose that the greatly improved electrocatalytic activity stems from the advantageous hierarchical structure and the synergistic effect between Ir02 and underlying potential-induced NiOOH, whereas the outstanding durability is attributed to the unique role of NiO in preventing Ir02 dissolution.									41	0	0	0	3	0	41			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000477787200023	31256582

The periodic potential oscillation under constant-current electrolytic condition was observed for the first time in the process of Mn oxide-catalyzed water electro-oxidation at a large current density. Taking advantage of the oscillation, the energy consumption was reduced by 10.9% as a results of an average potential drop of 0.28 V at a current density of 0.3 A/cm(2). A possible oscillation mechanism was proposed based on the influence of anode material, current density, [Mn2+], and Mn oxide structure. Nonlinear dynamical equations for constant-current condition were analyzed considering the time-varying kinetic parameters that differ from the kinetic constants under constant-voltage condition, in order to provide insights into the catalytic effect of the Mn(III) species and the critical parameters during oscillation. It is possible for the oscillation to be further enhanced by a more suitable external electric field, which suggested a potential strategy toward highly efficient industrial OER technologies with low electrolytic energy consumption at large current.

The solution chemistry and thermal decomposition kinetics of the mixed precursors were investigated by ultra violet/visible (UV/vis) spectroscopy and thermogravimetry (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). respectively The physiochemical characterization of the resulting materials was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemical measurements. It is shown from the UV/vis spectra that the electronic absorption intensity of IrCl62- complexes in the precursors decreases in the presence of TEOS. indicating the interaction between these two components. Thermal analysis shows the decomposition reaction of H2IrCl6 is inhibited by TEOS in the low temperature range, but the further oxidation reaction at high temperatures of formed intermediates is independent of the presence of silane component. Physical measurements show a restriction effect of silica on the ciystallization and crystal growth processes of IrO2, leading to the formation of finer oxide pal tidies and the porous morphology of the binary oxide films. The porous composite films exhibit high apparent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction In addition, the long-term stability of Ti-supported IrO2 electrodes is found to apparently improve with appropriate amount of SiO2 incorporation, as tested under galvanostatic electrolysis.

However, their poor conductivity, ease of agglomeration, and low intrinsic activity limit their practical application. To date, improvement of the intrinsic activity and stability of NiFe-LDHs through the introduction of heteroatoms or its combination with other conductive substrates to enhance their water-splitting performance has drawn increasing attention. In this study, vertically interlaced ternary phosphatised nickel/iron hybrids grown on the surface of titanium carbide flakes (NiFeP/MXene) were successfully synthesised through a hydrothermal reaction and phosphating calcination process. The optimised NiFeP/MXene exhibited a low overpotential of 286 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 35 mV dec-1 for the OER, which exceeded the performance of several existing NiFe-based catalysts. NiFeP/MXene was further used as a water-splitting anode in an alkaline electrolyte, exhibiting a cell voltage of only 1.61 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the combination of MXene acting as a conductive substrate and the phosphating process can effectively tune the electronic structure and density of the electrocatalyst surface to promote the energy level of the d-band centre, resulting in an enhanced OER performance. This study provides a valuable guideline for designing high-performance MXenesupported NiFe-based OER catalysts.(c) 2021 Science China Press. Published by Elsevier B.V. and Science China Press.

The ternary mixed metal spinel oxides FexNi1-xCo2O4 (x= 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9,1) have been synthesized by a facile hydrothermal approach and calcination treatment using nickel foam as substrate. Fe/Ni ratios have been proved to affect the nanostructures of FexNi1-xCo2O which imply different intrinsic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). SEM images show that Fe0.5Ni0.5CO2O4 has the uniform nanowires morphology with about 30 nm of the diameter and 200-300 nm of the length. The OER measurements show that Fe0.5Ni0.5CO2O4 exhibits the better electrocatalytic performances with lower overpotential of 350 mV atJ= 10 mA cm(2). In addition, the smaller Tafel slope of 27 mV dec(-1) than other samples with different Fe/Ni ratios for Fe0.5Ni0.5CO2O4 is obtained. The improved OER activity of Fe0.5Ni0.5CO2O4 may be attributed to the synergistic effects from ternary mixed metals especially Fe-doping and the uniform nanowires supported on NF. Therefore, synthesizing Fe-doped multi-metal oxides with novel nanostructures may be a promising strategy for excellent OER electrocatalysts and it also provides a facile way for the fabrication of high-activity ternary mixed metal oxides electrocatalysts.

Herein, n-type Bi2WO6 with flower-like hierarchical structure and p-type Cu2O quantum dots (QDs) are coupled together to construct an efficient S-scheme heterojunction, which could enhance the migration efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. The electrochemical properties are investigated to explore the transportation features and donor density of charge carriers in the S-scheme heterojunction system. Meanwhile, the as-prepared S-scheme heterojunction presents improved photocatalytic activity towards water oxidation in comparison with the sole Bi2WO6 and Cu2O QDs systems under simulated solar light irradiation. Moreover, the initial O-2 evolution rate of the Cu2O QDs/Bi2WO6 heterojunction system is 2.3 and 9.7 fold that of sole Bi2WO6 and Cu2O QDs systems, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2079-4991		WOS:000832348400001	35889679

Herein, a nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (GO)-carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrid network supported coupled Co/MnO nanoparticles (Co/MnO@N-C) catalyst was prepared with a hydrothermal-pyrolysis method. The unique three-dimensional network structure of substrate allowed for the uniform dispersion of Co-MnO nanoparticles in the carbon skeleton. These characters enable the Co/MnO@N-C to possess the excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts. In alkaline electrolyte, the Co/MnO@N-C presents the outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance comparable to the commercial RuO(2)catalyst and the exceedingly good oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with positive half-wave potential of 0.90 V vs. RHE outperforming commercial Pt/C (0.84 V vs. RHE) and the recently reported analogous electrocatalysts. When it is applied to homemade Zn-air batteries, such a non-noble metal electrocatalyst can deliver a better power density, specific capacity and cycling stability than mixed Pt/C and RuO(2)catalyst, and exhibits a wide application prospect and great practical value.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000575289100001	32929889

Thus, the bifunctional electrocatalysts are required for the practical application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. In terms of the catalytic activity and structural stability, pyrochlore oxides (A(2)[B(2-x)A(x)]O7-y) have emerged as promising candidates. However, a limited use of A-site cations (e.g., lead or bismuth cations) of reported pyrochlore catalysts have hampered broad understanding of their catalytic effect and structure. More seriously, the catalytic origin of the pyrochlore structure was not clearly revealed yet. Here, we report the new nano crystalline yttrium ruthenate (Y-2[Ru2-xYx]O7-y) with pyrochlore structure. The prepared pyrochlore oxide demonstrates comparable catalytic activities in both ORR. and OER, compared to that of previously reported metal oxide-based catalysts such as perovskite oxides. Notably, we first find that the catalytic activity of the Y-2[Ru2-xYx]O7-y is associated with the oxidations and corresponding changes of geometric local structures of yttrium and ruthenium ions during electrocatalysis, which were investigated by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) in real-time. Zn-air batteries using the prepared pyrochlore oxide achieve highly enhanced charge and discharge performance with a stable potential retention for 200 cycles.									60	4	0	0	4	0	62			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000403631600095	28557460

The structural-morphological characteristics and electrochemical behavior of the catalysts were studied. Using current stress testing protocols, their resistance to degradation was assessed in comparison with that of a commercial Pt/C material. A combined approach to catalyst synthesis that consists in alloying platinum with copper and doping the support makes it possible to obtain catalysts with a uniform distribution of bimetallic nanoparticles on the carbon surface. The obtained catalysts exhibit high activity and durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000785500000001

This model predicts changes in particle size distribution due to impact attrition in the jet region as a function of operating parameters - temperature, particle impact velocity and time. The model provides good agreement with experimental results for iron and hematite as oxygen carriers, with limestone and lime as CO2 sorbent at temperatures from 20 to 800 degrees C and jet velocities from 59 to 221 m/s. It is found that fragmentation, abrasion, and material fatigue over the attrition duration must be considered. Two fitting parameters considering fatigue by material properties and repeated collisions are applied in this model, with their values determined based on nonlinear least squares regression following the evolution of the particle size distribution.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000612201400001

In this respect, a unique and facile method has been developed for the synthesis of ultrathin Fe-Co(OH)(2)-Co(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets from self-supported Prussian blue analogues by chronoamperometric method. High electrochemical surface area, improved electronic conductivity, enhanced mechanical stability, and atomic level thickness (similar to 3 nm) of the self-supported ultrathin nanosheets provided the boost for alkaline water oxidation. The ultrathin Fe-Co(OH)(2)-Co(O)(x)(OH)(y) nanosheets demonstrated 10 mA cm(-2) current density at only 250 mV overpotential for alkaline water oxidation. The ultrathin nanosheets also showed 24 h continuous oxygen evolution under chronoamperometric condition without losing the initial activity.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2574-0970			WOS:000555518200053

To test if selected arginine (Arg) residues are involved in the binding of HCO3-, we utilized oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis to construct Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutants carrying mutations in Arg residues in the D2 protein. Measurements of oxygen evolution showed that the D2 mutants R233Q (arginine-233 --> glutamine) and R251S (arginine-251 --> serine) were 10-fold more sensitive to formate than the wild type. The formate concentration giving half-maximal inhibition of the steady-state oxygen evolution rate was 48 mM, 4.5 mM and 4 mM for the wild type, R233Q and R251S, respectively. Measurements of oxygen evolution in single-turnover flashes confirm that the mutants are more sensitive to formate than the wild type. Measurements of chlorophyll alpha-fluorescence decay kinetics after the second saturating actinic flash indicated that, after formate treatment, the halftime of Q(A)- oxidation was decreased by approximately a factor of 2, 4 and 6 in the wild type, R251S and R233Q, respectively. The recombination rate between Q(A)- and S2 was approx. 2-fold slower in R251S and R233Q than in the wild type. In the presence of 100 mM sodium formate, reactivation of the Hill reaction by bicarbonate showed that the wild type had an apparent K(m) for bicarbonate of 0.5 mM, while the K(m) values for R233Q and R251S were 1.4 and 1.5 mM, respectively. We suggest that Arg-233 and Arg-251 in the D2 polypeptide contribute to stabilization of HCO3- binding in Photosystem II.									34	0	0	0	31	0	34			0006-3002			WOS:A1991GE27300006	1909178

The electrocatalytic cobalt materials were produced under different electrodeposition conditions, namely deposition in the absence or presence of bubbling oxygen or nitrogen gas with two gas flow rates (80 and 230 ml min-1) and at different current densities (50-800 A m-2) and deposition in a cobalt powder-containing bath. It has been shown that the electrocatalytic behaviour of the cobalt deposits can be significantly affected by deposition current density via a change of surface area of the cobalt deposits. A considerable HER overpotential decrease (up to 150 mV) has been achieved on the highly porous and active cobalt electrodes deposited in the presence of bubbling oxygen and chloride ions in deposition solution. However, the HER overpotential was increased on the cobalt electrodes deposited with bubbling nitrogen in the bath.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0021-891X			WOS:A1992KD37100004

Since the current electrocatalysts are usually based on high-cost and scarce noble metal elements (Pt, Ru, and Ir), developing low-cost and earth-abundant catalysts is of great practical promise for realizing industry-scale applications. In this regard, electrocatalysts based on 3d transition metal elements (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, etc.) have been proposed as a class of prospective materials due to their abundance and high activity. In this work, recent advances in developing high-performance nanostructured electrocatalysts for sustainable clean energy conversion are briefly reviewed, with a particular focus on morphology design, composition tuning, surface engineering and metal coordination symmetry/geometry control. The latest studies indicate that carefully designed nanostructures based on 3d transition metal elements can attain comparable electrocatalytic performance to the commercial noble metal-based counterparts. This review may offer new insights into the rational design of nanostructures with further improved electrocatalytic activity and pathway selectivity to achieve the ultimate goal of realizing renewable electrochemical energy conversion.									38	4	0	0	3	0	38			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000474586600002

Here, Ru nanoparticles supported on oxygen-deficient TiO2@carbon hybrids (Ru/TiO2-V-O@C) were efficiently fabricated via one-pot carburization of RuCl3, TiO2(B) and melamine. The melamine additive assists the formation of oxygen vacancies (V-O) and Ru-0 and introduces a beneficial carbon dopant. Ru/TiO2-V-O@C features a remarkably enhanced alkaline HER performance with an overpotential of only 64 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This satisfactory catalytic performance originates from the strong electronic interaction between Ru and TiO2-V-O and the synergistic interplay between TiO2-V-O and the carbon dopant. This synergistic cooperation improves the conductivity, promotes the dissociation of H2O and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption free energy. This study opens an avenue for the reasonable design of multi-component nanostructures and gives in-depth insights into the alkaline HER mechanism.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637102900001

This personal account article analyzes potential downstream translation problems and reviews alternative chemistries with a potential higher return. Liberation of oxygen for accepting the holes is a kinetically demanding half reaction afflicted with kinetic hindrances and high overpotentials, while at the same time no marketable value is created (atmospheric oxygen is free to use). In spite of exciting science created, application in real industrial set-ups is currently impossible, and possible funding promises to contribute to a sustainable society become a debt difficult to return. We discuss possible alternative targets of (photo)electrochemistry as entry points where chemical value products and technical oxidants are created, with partially greater ease, lower losses, and higher benefits.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1527-8999	1528-0691		WOS:000438733200026	29320606

Thus, development of sustainable, abundant and economical semiconductor nanomaterials as the catalyst for photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction is very challenging in achieving high efficiency in the overall water splitting reaction. Herein, we report a new porous Ni-W mixed metal phosphonate material NiWPPA-4 with open framework structure through simple hydrothermal route and its crystalline framework has been indexed into a new orthorhombic crystal with unit cell dimensions: a=14.5506 angstrom, b=17.6445 angstrom, c=20.1766 angstrom and alpha=beta=gamma=90 degrees. NiWPPA-4 has been successfully utilized for photoelectrochemical OER from moderately basic medium [1(M) KOH] under constant irradiation of 100 mWcm(-1) light source. Semiconducting property together with nanoscale porosity in the Ni-W mixed metal phosphonate is responsible for photoelectrochemical OER in alkaline pH. To the best of our knowledge it is the first report on a mixed metal phosphonate material, which showed excellent catalytic activity in the photoelectrochemical OER. The onset-potential of NiWPPA-4 prepared over ITO coated glass was only -410 mV vs Ag/AgCl and the oxygen evolution rate is 275 mu mol g(-1). This study thus established efficient photoelectrochemical OER on porous mixed-metal phosphonates and offer opportunities for the utilization of metal phosphonates as potential photocatalyst in the energy conversion processes.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000506220400001

In sulphide free NaOH solution, the galvanostatic anodic polarisation curves are characterised by two well defined steps before tending finally to values characteristic for the oxygen evolution reaction. However, using cyclic voltammetry technique, three anodic peaks are distinct. On the other hand, the cathodic half cycles using both techniques are characterised by two cathodic reduction steps before hydrogen evolution commences. In the presence of increasing sulphide content the polarisation curves are characterised by the presence of several anodic and cathodic regions. The anodic regions correspond to the simultaneous formation and oxidation of different Fe sulphide and oxide species. A mechanism is thus proposed for the formation and reduction of iron sulphide species.									19	2	0	0	0	1	20			1478-422X	1743-2782		WOS:000257881900012

However, most electrocatalysts are powders and require to deposit on conductive substrates with binders, leading to complicated steps and hindering the improvement of long-term stability. This work exhibits a solid-phase hot-pressing method to prepare polyoxometalates based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (POMs-ZIFs) precursor on carbon cloth (CC) rapidly and mildly. After phosphidation treatment, nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon layers coated phosphide on CC (CoP/MoP@NC/CC) is synthesized. CoP/MoP@NC/CC has excellent electrocatalytic performance for water splitting due to the synergistic effect of CoP, MoP and as-formed oxide/hydroxide layers. It shows the low overpotentials of 94 mV for HER and 270 mV for OER at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, which is superior to most of the reported phosphide-based electrocatalysts. Notably, the ultra-high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) can be reached at the overpotentials of only 475 mV for HER and 657 mV for OER. As both cathode and anode for overall water splitting, CoP/MoP@NC can achieve the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at the cell voltage of 1.71 V. The solid-phase hot-pressing method ensures the tight and uniform growth of the fast nucleating and stable materials on substrate and applies for more electrochemical reactions.									86	1	0	0	3	0	86			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700053

XRD patterns confirm the composition of NiSx/NF(Ox): two kinds of crystal phase including beta-NiS and Ni3S2. While using bare NF as support under identical conditions, only Ni3S2 phase can be detected. SEM images reveal two kinds of morphologies of NiSx/NF(Ox) including pyramids structure of beta-NiS and nanorod-like structure of Ni3S2, which implies the tuning effect of electro-pretreatment of NF on the selective preparation of NiSx crystal phase. It can be speculated that Ni(OH)(2) layer derived from electro-oxidized NF is responsible for the growth of beta-NiS while metallic Ni is transformed into Ni2S3 during sulfurization. Electrochemical measurements for OER indicate the enhanced electrocatalytic activity of NiSx/NF(Ox) with a small overpotential of 72 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) compared with Ni3S2/NF, which may be ascribed to the improved electron-transfer kinetics relating to the unique atomic configurations and crystalline structures of beta-NiS. The electro-oxidation pretreatment of nickel foam provides a simple and convenient method by tuning different NiSx crystal phases for preparing excellent OER eletrocatalysts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

A one-step electrodeposition process is performed without any additives to fabricate NiFe and x cobalt-doped nickel/iron (xCoNiFe) layer-double-hydroxide catalysts directly on nickel foam. The addition of cobalt nitrate in the synthesis solution significantly affects the final form of the catalyst: the addition of 2 mm cobalt nitrate into the aqueous solution of 4 mm nickel and iron nitrate stabilizes the electrochemical synthesis of the catalyst, which leads to the formation of a homogenously spread 3D interconnected structure with a high electroactive surface area (0.07 cm(2), 1.1 m(2) cm(-2): including nickel foam substrate); it induces the formation of Ni3+ desirable for the formation of the catalytically active (oxy)hydroxides, which is not observed for the state-of-the-art NiFe. The significant role of the addition of cobalt translates into improved preliminary OER catalytic stability and activity of the catalyst with an onset potential of 1.40 V, overpotential of 224 mV determined at 10 mA cm(-2), and only 0.7% loss in stability after 22 h working in alkaline conditions compared with the initial parameters.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000708574900001

This article intends to design the catalytic of crystalline (amorphous) TiO2/two-dimensional MoS2 sandwich structure supporting single-atoms (SAs), and explore the effect of this particular structure on the photocatalytic reaction. After the effective mass, electrostatic potential, light absorption spectrum and other related properties were calculated. The analysis shows that catalysts with amorphous sandwich structure has excellent and electron-hole separation ability, and precious metal SAs can attach to amorphous sandwich structure more stably. Except for the Pt@Amorphousr-TiO2/MoS2 sandwich structure single-atom catalysts (SACs), which only has an excellent effect on the oxygen evolution of water, all the other interlayer catalysts have the two characteristics of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. The catalyst designed in this paper has innovative design ideas, high-efficiency research and development value, which significantly improves the activity, selectivity and durability of the photocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-7608	1097-461X		WOS:000683797300001

In this research study, we have deposited Co3O4 nanoparticles on polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP) through electro-spun technique followed by carbonization. The structure and composition studies were carried by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction techniques. The Co3O4 nanoparticles are deposited on the nanofibers of PVP with improved surface area and conductivity; therefore, the hybrid material has shown an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. The onset potential for the presented OER catalyst is about 1.46 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and an overpotential of 280 mV is needed to reach a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The Co3O4 nanoparticles are highly durable for 20 hr and very stable. The low charge transfer resistance of 29.23 omega is offered by the Co3O4 hybrid material, which facilitated the OER kinetics in alkaline media. These obtained OER results may be utilized for the overall water splitting and the synthetic strategy is low cost, thus it favors the mass production of functional materials for diverse electrochemical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-4536	2192-6549		WOS:000698173000001

The functionalities of precursor surfactants were isolated and analyzed. A plausible formation mechanism of the spherical urchin-like microclusters has been furnished through time-dependent investigations. Introduction of other transitional metal doping (Cu, Ni) would give rise to a substantial morphological change associated with a surface area drop. The directly grown cobalt-based hydroxide composite electrodes were found to be capable of catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under both neutral pH and alkaline conditions. The favorable 3D dendritic morphology and porous structure provide large surface areas and possible defect sites that are likely responsible for their robust electrochemical activity.									52	0	0	0	3	0	52			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000332604200048	24525520

The synthetic approach for the IrO2-BN-rGO catalyst involves the combination of pyrolysis and hydrothermal methods used for hierarchical nanostructures. BN-rGO possesses B-N, B-C, and N-C functional groups to support and stabilize the IrO2 catalyst nanoparticles. The altered electronic states of IrO2 on the BN-rGO support are compared with those of IrO2 on a non-doped support, rGO (IrO2-rGO), and on commercial BN sheets (IrO2-c-BN). The catalyst shows a low overpotential (300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), high current density (55 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V), and significantly high durability (12 350 cycles; 45 h) in an acidic environment. The high stability of IrO2-BN-rGO may result from the presence of a chemically and electrochemically stable B-N bond. We confirm that other functional groups (B-C and N-C) and the rGO framework are equally crucial for better attachment of IrO2 nanoparticles.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631794800001

Here, the composite of cobalt molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles embedded in crosslinked nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF) has been synthesized via an electrospinning process and pyrolysis treatment. As an effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF only requires the overpotentials of 81 mV and 219 mV at the current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 20 mA cm-2, respectively. Moreover, the water electrolyzer with the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF as the cathode and anode catalysts requires a cell voltage of 1.59 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm-2. The Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF also achieves the excellent stability up to 24 h for HER, OER and overall water spitting in 1.0 M KOH. The excellent catalytic activity of the Co0.4Mo0.6P@CL-NCNF is benefits from the synergistic effect between components and the crosslinked structure of carbon nanofiber.

Herein, 3D NiFe layered double hydroxide-polyoxometalate (LDH-POM; polyoxometalate, i.e., K-8[SiW11O39]center dot 13H(2)O) with micro-flower morphology is in situ grown on Ni foam via a facile one-step hydrothermal method, which can be used as a high-efficient bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting.

Experimental investigation and density functional theory calculation indicate that, compared to pristine NiFe LDH, W6+ in NiFe LDH-POM can effectively minimize the adsorption energy barriers of *OH and therefore improve the kinetics of OER.

A density functional theory (DFT) calculation using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) scheme and supercell model with the inclusion of modified dispersion correction (DFT-D2) has been performed to explore the adsorption trends and evaluate adsorption energies of H, C, N, O, and S (atoms) and H-2, C-2, N-2, O-2, and S-2 (homonuclear diatomic molecules) on Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces for multiple sites, in search of the most active catalytic site. Our chemisorption data revealed that the incorporation of DFT-D2 correction strengthens the adsorption energy by the amount of 0.05 eV to 0.67 eV for atoms and gases. Finally, this study focuses on unveiling catalytic activity of the two seemingly simplest electrochemical reactions; the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on numerous sites of Pt surfaces using the adsorption strength of H and O with the inclusion of DFT-D2 correction, which shows the good consistency with the results of standard DFT calculations. The highest catalytic activity towards HER is shown by Pt(100) in contrast to the best OER catalytic activity by Pt(111) surface with their respective most favorable 4fh and top sites.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000446656900037

For the inert crystal Al2O3, we found that the surface oxygen vacancy amount of Al2O3 can be controlled by pretreatment of CO reduction, and the nearby coordinatively unsaturated Al-O (Al-cu-O) pairs can effectively catalyze propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The C3H6 formation rate of gamma/delta-Al2O3 is in line with the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The experiments and DFT calculations illuminate the importance of oxygen vacancy on the surface of Al2O3 for PDH reaction. The consumption of lattice oxygen reduces the one coordination number of the bonding Al, the formed Al-cu-O as defective acid-base pairs, can be an effective way to tune the adsorption energy of the intermediates and the barriers of key steps (the first C-H activation and H-2 formation) to enhance the performance of PDH through both site-dependent concerted and stepwise mechanisms.

Therefore, emphasis is being put on the development of electrodes capable of the efficient production of hydrogen and oxygen from water. To make the green alternative possible, the solution should be cost-efficient and well processable, generating less waste which is a huge challenge. In this work, the laser-based modification technique of the titania nanotubes containing sputtered transition metal species (Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) was employed. The characteristics of the electrodes are provided both for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, where the influence of the laser treatment has been found to have the opposite effect. The structural and chemical analysis of the substrate material provides insight into pathways towards more efficient, low-temperature water splitting. Laser-assisted integration of transition metal with the tubular nanostructure results in the match-like structure where the metal species are accumulated at the head. The electrochemical data indicates a significant decrease in material resistance that leads to an overpotential of only +0.69 V at 10 mA cm(-2) for nickel-modified material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000758420300001	35108692

In this work, transition metal-doped cobalt-nickel sulfide spinels are directly produced via a continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis (CHFS) approach. The nanosized cobalt-nickel sulfides are doped with Ag, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, and Ti and evaluated as bifunctional OER and ORR catalyst for Zn-air battery application. Among the doped spinel catalysts, Mn-doped cobalt-nickel sulfides (Ni1.29Co1.49Mn0.22S4) exhibit the most promising OER and ORR performance, showing an ORR onset potential of 0.9 V vs. RHE and an OER overpotential of 348 mV measured at 10 mA cm(-2), which is attributed to their high surface area, electronic structure of the dopant species, and the synergistic coupling of the dopant species with the active host cations. The dopant ions primarily alter the host cation composition, with the Mn(iii) cation linked to the introduction of active sites by its favourable electronic structure. A power density of 75 mW cm(-2) is achieved at a current density of 140 mA cm(-2) for the zinc-air battery using the manganese-doped catalyst, a 12% improvement over the undoped cobalt-nickel sulfide and superior to that of the battery with a commercial RuO2 catalyst.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000591071500056	35516532

Hence, it is significant to improve its HER activity to make it a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the decomposition of water. Here, a simple galvanostatic electrodeposition method was designed for the successful construction of the bifunctional FeNi3@FeNi LDH electrocatalyst. The as-prepared catalyst displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity for HER/OER in 1.0 M KOH. To drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER/OER, an overpotential of 106/199 mV was needed, respectively. In a two-electrode system with the FeNi3@FeNi LDH/NF as the anode and the cathode simultaneously, the overpotential hardly changed after continuously working for 168 h at 10 mA cm(-2). Compared with other FeNi-based catalysts, the present catalyst possessed close or better electrocatalytic activity.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000641875000001	33881026

Herein, Co-doped Ni3N nanosheets loaded on nickel foam (Co-Ni3N) were synthesized. The as-prepared Co-Ni3N exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that Co-Ni3N with redistribution of electrons not only can facilitate the HER kinetics but also can regulate intermediates adsorption energies for OER. Specifically, the Co- Ni3N exhibits high efficiency and stable catalytic activity, with an overpotential of only 30 and 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in 1 M KOH, respectively. This work provides strong evidence to the merit of Co doping to improve the innate electrochemical performance in bifunctional catalysts, which might have a common impact in many similar metalmetal nitride electrocatalysts.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			1948-7185			WOS:000621419900001	33539095

Here, via a controllable NH3 treatment, we construct sandwiched p-n homojunctions in three-unit-cells n-type SnS2 (n-SnS2) nanosheet arrays using nitrogen (N) as acceptor dopants. The optimal N-doped n-SnS2 (pnp-SnS2) with such unique structure achieves a record photocurrent density of 3.28 mA cm(-2), which is 21 times as high as that of n-SnS2 and the highest value among all the SnS2 photoanodes reported so far. Moreover, the stoichiometric O-2 and H-2 evolution from water was achieved with Faradaic efficiencies close to 100 %. The superior performance could be attributed to the facilitated electron-hole separation/transfer, accelerated surface OER kinetics, prolonged carrier lifetime, and improved structural stability.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000598642900001	33128336

Herein, single-crystalline SrTaO2N nanoplates and polyhedra are achieved selectively. Central to these synthetic advances is the crystallization pathways used, in which single-crystalline SrTaO2N nanoplates form by topotactic nitridation of aerosol-prepared Sr2Ta2O7 nanoplates and SrTaO2N polyhedra form by flux-assisted nitridation of the nanoplates. Evaluation of these materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) showed improved performance for the SrTaO2N nanoplates, with a record apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 6.1% for OER compared to the polyhedra (AQE: 1.6%) and SrTaO2N polycrystals (AQE:0.6%). The enhanced performance from the nanoplates arises from their morphology and lower defect density. These results highlight the importance of developing new synthetic routes to high quality oxynitrides.									23	2	0	0	2	0	25			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000413896400046	28924995

As a catalyst, the so-constructed CoFe2O4 NCs show significantly higher OER performance than bare CoFe2O4 and CC, leading to an overpotential of 1.59 V for the OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm. Furthermore, CoFe2O4 NCs on CC electrodes also exhibit good ORR performance, which is comparable to Pt/C, significantly higher than that of bare carbon fiber paper, and acts as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. The CoFe2O4 NCs anchored on the CC electrodes exhibit remarkably long-term stability, which is evaluated by continuous cycling (over 5,000 cycles), without any morphological change, but preserving all the materials within the electrode. The results indicate that the CoFe2O4 NCs have a promising potential for efficient, cost-effective, and durable oxygen electrocatalysis at large scales using earth-abundant materials and low-cost fabrication processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000690717900003

The key proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) event in water oxidation mediated by a cobalt-phosphate-based heterogeneous catalyst is the one-electron, one-proton conversion of Co-III-OH to Co-IV-O. We now isolate the kinetics of this PCET step in a molecular Co4O4 cubane model compound. Detailed electrochemical, stopped-flow, and NMR studies of the CoIII-OH to Co-IV-O reaction reveal distinct mechanisms for the unidirectional PCET self-exchange reaction and the corresponding bidirectional PCET. A stepwise mechanism, with rate-limiting electron transfer is observed for the bidirectional PCET at an electrode surface and in solution, whereas a concerted proton electron transfer displaying a moderate KIE (4.3 +/- 0.2), is observed for the unidirectional self-exchange reaction.									112	2	0	0	25	0	112			0002-7863			WOS:000289829100004	21413703

The electrosynthsis yield of 2,5-dichlorophenol reached 57% and the selectivity of 2,5-dichlorophenol was as high as 93% by using the IrSnO_x as an anode, which is obviously better than those obtained by using the commercial chlorine evolution electrode, oxygen evolution electrode and Pt electrode as anodes.

The values and the potential dependences of the measured parameters were found to depend upon the concentration of dissolved oxygen. This is one of the reasons why photoelectrochemical measurements in this system have sometimes given poorly reproducible results. The effects of the presence of dissolved oxygen are discussed by considering the surface states and the relative energy levels of redox potentials in solution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The pristine nanostructures of the Pt-M alloy NPs should determine the ORR activity of the dealloyed NPs. In this study, we investigated the voltammetric dealloying behavior of the Pt-Co and nitrogen-introduced Pt-Co alloy NPs generated by synchronous arc-plasma deposition of Pt and Co. The results showed that the dealloying behavior is sensitive to cobalt nitride in the pristine NPs, leading to the preferential generation of a Pt-rich shell/Pt-Co alloy core architecture having enhanced ORR activity.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2470-1343			WOS:000392721200019	31457193

Herein, we report the synthesis of nanostructured porous hollow nickel telluride nanosheets and their use as bifunctional electrocatalyst towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, anticipating an enhanced performance owing to their 2D sheet like morphology, conductivity, porous nature providing larger catalytic surface for water splitting reaction. In this regard, nickel telluride nanostructures were synthesized via an anion-exchange-reaction between pre-synthesized nickel hydroxide hexagonal nano sheets and tellurium ions under hydrothermal conditions. The as-synthesized nano structures were characterized for structural, morphological and compositional properties using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Nickel telluride modified electrodes were tested as bifunctional electrocatalyst under acidic and alkaline conditions, through linear sweep voltammetry and constant current chronopotentiometry methods. The modified electrodes revealed an onset potential of -422 mV and 87.4 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope towards HER and overpotential of 679 mV and 151 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope towards OER. The lower onset potentials are complimented with excellent electrocatalytic stability. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we explore a facile surfactant-assisted approach for fabricating Ir-Sn (Ir/Sn = 0.6/0.4, by mol.) nano-oxide catalysts with good morphology control. Direct proofs from XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectra indicate hydrophilic triblock polymer (TBP, like Pluronic (R) F108) surfactant can boost the formation of stable solid-solution structure. With the TBP hydrophilic and block-length increase, the fabricated Ir-Sn oxides undergoing the rod-to-sphere transition obtain the relatively lower crystallization, decreased crystallite size, Ir-enriched surface and incremental available active sites, all of which can bolster the OER activity and stability. Meanwhile, it is observed that the coupled Ir oxidative etching takes a crucial role in determining the material structure and performance. Compared with commercial Ir black, half-cell tests confirm F108-assistant catalysts with over 40 wt% Ir loading reduction show 2-fold activity enhancement as well as significant stability improvement. The lowest cell voltage using 0.88 mg cm(-2) Ir loading is only 1.621 V at 1000 mA cm(-2) and 80 degrees C with a concomitant energy efficiency of 75.8% which is beyond the DOE 2017 efficiency target of 74%.

It is shown that for an increased Li+-ion concentration, the potential of LiMn2O4 electrodes is shifted to a positive value, improving the kinetics. Anions in electrolytes exert a strong influence on the electrochemical performance of LiMn2O4 electrodes, which results from Mn dissolution and oxygen evolution. The electrode in a 5 M LiNO3 solution with minimal Mn dissolution and a high oxygen overpotential exhibited good rate capability and cyclability. Conversely, in a LiCl solution, the extent of Mn dissolution is large, and the electrode is affected simultaneously by O-2 and Cl-2 evolution. Although the addition of zinc salts inhibits certain side reactions, a sharp deterioration in the capacity results during charge/discharge cycling. The addition of zinc salts into the Li2SO4 solution also results in an increase in the amount of dissolved Mn. However, the oxygen evolution is markedly attenuated, and the capacity retention rate of the LiMn2O4 electrode in the sulfate solution is significantly improved, increasing from 35 to 58% after 1000 cycles at 2 C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1452-3981			WOS:000366177700042

Among them, the heterostructure with the largest E-BI of 1.57 V attains the smallest overpotential of 97 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 243 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH. The corresponding two-electrode electrolyzer requires a cell voltage of 1.685 Vat 50 mA cm(-2) and shows admirable long-term stability at 100 mA cm(-2) with a Faraday efficiency of around 98%. These promoted electrocatalytic performances originate from the enhanced active site, accelerated charge transfer, enlarged electrochemical active surface area, and synergy between different components at the heterointerface. This work represents a promising avenue to construct cost-efficient semiconductor heterostructures as bifunctional electrocatalysts applied to the sustainable energy industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000797959300052	35394747

The TEM, Raman, XRD and XPS confirm the germination of nitrogen doped graphene and nano-sized cobalt oxides. The optimized Co-N/G catalyst consists of the highest contents of pyridinic nitrogen and CoO, which efficiently catalyze both ORR and OER. The strong coupling between cobalt oxides and N-graphene endows Co-N/G 600 with a low reversible overvoltage of 0.96 V between ORR and OER in alkaline medium, which is superior to novel catalysts such as Pt/C (1.24 V), IrO2 (1.43 V) and RuO2 (1.35 V), rendering it bi-catalyst efficient and economical for reversible oxygen electrode reactions.

The efforts to untie the gordian knot of developing a first-rate bifunctional electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting reaction via electronically modulated bimetallic carbides using a dual transition metal strategy have been reported here. Herein we in-situ fabricated a composite architecture consisting of N-doped CNT/graphene hybrid anchoring Co/MoC, Co/WC and Co/VC Via an integrated pyrolysis technique to have a beneficial synergistic co-operation between each component and dual Mott-Schottky junctions resulting in a bifunctional HER and OER (oxygen evolution reaction) active catalyst exhibiting exemplary activity in both acidic and basic media. Co/MoC@NC exhibits the best activity with a lower overpotential of 279 and 260 mV towards OER and 92 and 143 mV towards HER to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in basic and acidic media, respectively. Along with this, it presents excellent water splitting performance in basic media, showing a relatively low cell voltage of about 1.686 V for driving a current of 10 mA/cm(2) with decent stability. It is anticipated that the tandem electron transfer between the Co, MoC moieties and nitrogen doping-induced defects in graphene/CNT hybrid-based conductive network support might be a reason for the superiority over other recently reported Mo based carbide materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2214-9937			WOS:000861551400003

However, most of them fail to overcome the poor stability of amorphous iridium oxide formed on the surface after leaching of the non-noble metal. Herein, we describe a LiLa2IrO6 electrocatalyst with a thin IrO2 shell (IrO2/LiLa2IrO6) that achieves a win-win situation for both activity and stability under harsh acidic conditions. The synthesized IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 catalyst exhibits outstanding activity for the OER in 0.1 M HClO4 electrolyte, and needs a low overpotential of 278 mV to deliver the benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to commercially available IrO2 and most recently reported catalysts. More significantly, IrO2/LiLa2IrO6 shows enhanced electrochemical stability with only 160 mV increase in potential after testing over 13 h, in contrast to commercial IrO2 that almost lost its activity toward the OER in 7 h. This demonstrates that the high performance for catalyzing the OER is ascribed to the in situ formed IrOx highly active layer by surface reconstruction as well as the strong interaction between IrOx and bulk LiLa2IrO6.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000744899200001

Herein, a cation exchange reaction is employed for the synthesis of NixCo(3-x)O4 nanoparticles (NPs) supported on aminated carbon nanotubes (NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs). The obtained NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs shows an enhanced catalytic bifunctionality for the ORR and OER. Specifically, the NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs can deliver ORR onset (E-onset) and half-wave potentials (E-1/2) of 0.954 and 0.863 V vs. RHE, respectively, and only needs an overpotential of 386 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The ORR catalytic activity of the NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs is comparable to that of the Pt/C (with an E-onset and E-1/2 of 0.964 and 0.858 V vs. RHE, respectively), while its OER activity is higher than that of RuO2/C. Additionally, the NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs exhibits a potential difference of 0.764 V in the OER current density at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR current density at 3 mA cm(-2), which is lower than those of most state-of-the-art catalysts. Most interestingly, the Zn-air battery with the NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs shows higher durability and performance than the batteries with Pt-RuO2/C (an integrated catalyst consisting of Pt/C and RuO2/C). These results clearly demonstrate that the NixCo(3-x)O4/NH2-CNTs is a durable and efficient bifunctional catalyst with great potential for practical applications.									45	2	0	0	0	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000433427300022

The enhanced high performance is primarily attributed to the formation of large amounts of heterogeneous interfaces and sufficient oxygen vacancies, which conduce to provide more active sites and tune the electronic structure, respectively.

Herein, we report a CoIr alloy supported on two dimensional (2D) graphitic-N doped carbon (CoIr@CN) through a one-step annealing process from an Ir-doped 2D Co-MOF, which exhibits a remarkably reduced Ir loading (2.69 wt%) and enhanced electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ir plays an essential role of optimizing the properties of metal nanoparticles and simultaneously effecting the calcining process to adjust the N-doping structure, eventually modulating the synergetic effect between alloy nanoparticles and the N-doped carbon support. Owing to the positive effect of such multiple electronic structure optimization, the electron transfer between alloy nanoparticles and N-doped carbon is promoted to enable more moderate adsorption energies of reaction intermediates in both the OER and HER. Impressively, CoIr@CN exhibits a low OER/HER overpotential of 269 mV/70 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and 25 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 for HER, as well as a negligible decay of catalytic activity after long-term stability measurements for OER/HER. This study offers an effective way for designing strong metal-support interaction through multiple electronic structure modification, which effectively improves the OER/HER performance of supported catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000822033000001

In this work, ALD was used to perform surface-directed modification of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(OOH) electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to elucidate the different roles of iron as a surface dopant and of iron distributed throughout the NiOOH structure. Electrochemical and material characterization of FeOx ALD-modified Ni(OH)(2) indicates that iron is deposited on the surface of Ni(OH)(2) sheets without modifying its bulk properties. Sub-monolayer amounts of iron were deposited on the surface of Ni(OH)(2) using low cycle numbers of ALD. This surface iron results in high OER activity, characteristic of Ni-Fe(OOH) catalysts. Ni(OH)(2)/Ni (OOH) catalysts modified to incorporate iron throughout the structure were prepared by depositing large cycle numbers of FeOx ALD, which results in the deposition of a Fe2O3 overlayer. Corrosion of this Fe2O3 overlayer during electrochemical cycling in alkaline electrolyte leads to the incorporation of iron throughout the structure of Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(OOH) while leaving some iron at the surface. Incorporation of iron throughout the Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(OOH) structure was found to increase OER geometric activity for thick, high surface area Ni(OH)(2)/Ni(OOH) catalysts. Lastly, Ni-FeOx electrocatalysts synthesized fully by ALD were investigated for the OER; these catalysts demonstrated high OER activity and potential for photocatalysis applications.

The electrochemical results are comparable with a full PEM electrolysis cell. The kinetic analysis reveals Tafel slopes of about 50 and 60 mV dec(-1) for all temperatures with the PEM electrolysis hardware and the MRDE, respectively. The activation energy of the OER obtained with the MRDE and the PEM electrolysis cell are 75 and 68 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Detailed cyclic voltammetric measurements of Ir-based CCMs were performed to examine the influence of operating temperature, Ti-based current collectors, the scan rate on the adsorbed charge, and the electro kinetics of the OER. Six different expanded metal Ti current collectors were analyzed in sulfuric acid and their impact on the CCM charging at various temperatures were examined in order to calculate the electrode's inner and outer charge. It was observed that the voltammetric charge is proportional to the coverage of the CCM by the current collector. The MRDE tool presented here is an ideal tool for electrochemical characterization of CCMs and current collectors and allows for an economical and accelerated screening of these important PEM electrolyzer components without the requirement of full cell testing.

Photocatalytic reactions for H-2 and O-2 evolution in the case of sacrificial reagents were performed under ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. The order of the activities of H-2 evolution was CaSnO3 > SrSnO3 > BaSnO3, agreeing not only with that of the conduction-band edges (or band gaps) but also with that of the transferred excitation energy, while that of O-2 evolution was CaSnO3 < SrSnO3 < BaSnO3, consistent with that of the angle of the Sn-O-Sn bonds as well as the delocalization of excited energy. When loaded with RuO2 cocatalyst, both CaSnO3 and SrSnO3 can efficiently split pure water into hydrogen and oxygen in a stoichiometric ratio under UV light irradiation. In addition, RuO2-loaded SrSnO3 showed higher water splitting activity than RuO2-loaded CaSnO3 did. This is attributed to the suitable conduction and valence band edges and to high mobility of the photogenerated charge carriers caused by the proper distortion of SnO6 connection in SrSnO3. The RuO2-loaded BaSnO3 photocatalyst cannot split pure water, which might be because of a high concentration of defect centers such as Sn2+ ions and the probability of radiative recombination in BaSnO3.									158	4	0	0	11	4	162			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000247794300013

Cobalt (oxy-)hydroxides are among the most active electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline electrolytes free from rare-earth metals. However, identifying the active phase of electrocatalysts under operational OER conditions is often difficult, which largely impedes the design of cobalt-based electrocatalysts with improved performance and durability. This lack of understanding is partially contributed by the difficulties in operando characterizations on the details of electrochemically driven phase transitions. In this work, we combine operando Raman spectroscopy and operando optical characterization to investigate the phase equilibrium and kinetics of the phase transition in CoOxHy driven by applied electrochemical driving force. We found an irreversible phase transition during the first electrochemical test, after which phase transition became fully reversible in each following cycle. We further established the relationship between kinetic parameters of the reversible phase transition and applied potential by using the time-resolved operando optical method. Our work provides a precise approach toward a better understanding of the electrochemically driven phase transition in OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000864719900001

Herein, we have reported an effective strategy for designing one-dimensional perovskite oxides with unique hollow nanostructures by combining an electrospinning technology and high temperature carbonization and oxidation. The LaCoO3 (LC) was used as the model catalyst and the La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 (LSCF) hollow nanofibers were synthesized through the A-site and AB-site doping engineering. The building block perovskite oxides nanoparticles connected with each other along one direction and formed a one-dimensional (1D) hollow nanofibers with hierarchical architectures. The one-dimensional perovskite oxide nanofibers can be tailored from porous hollow structures to solid nanofibers by adjusting the temperatures and the A, B site doping. Compared with the LC (444 mV) and the LSC (426 mV), the LSCF demonstrated the superior OER activity with overpotential of 353 mV (10 mA cm(-2)), suggesting the enhanced activity by the AB-site doping engineering. A series of LSCF electrocatalysts were prepared at different carbonization and oxidation conditions and the La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3 prepared at 700 degrees C obtained the best catalytic performance and exceptional durability. This strategy provides an effective approach to design advanced perovskite oxides catalysts with superior activity and stability. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, Fe1Co2 alloy nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in N-doped carbon nanotubes/carbon nanosheets (CNTs/CNSs) (denoted as Fe1Co2-NC) were synthesized in situ by pyrolyzing Fe-chitosan, Co-chitosan chelates and urea. It is demonstrated that the interaction of Fe and Co can effectively modulate electronic structure of Fe and Co, in which ionic state cobalt and iron were partially oxidized, contributing to the enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. Meanwhile, CNTs/CNSs multi-dimensional porous carbon frameworks facilitated adequate exposure of active sites and mass/electron smooth transport. Accordingly, the resulting Fe1Co2-NC catalyst exhibited a high half-wave potential of 0.88 V (vs. RHE) for ORR and a small over potential (0.356 V) for OER, rendering it with an ultralow potential difference (0.706 V) that can rival that of Pt/C thorn RuO2 (0.69 V). Impressively, the assembled ZABs with Fe1Co2-NC as a cathode catalyst achieved a high open circuit voltage (1.501 V), maximum power density (203.4 mW cm(-2)), energy density (820.30 W h kg(-1)) and robust durability with a slightly increased voltage gap (0.058 V) after 209 h charge-discharge test, shedding light on the great application potential.

Herein, we study the highly active SrIr0.8Zn0.2O3 perovskite for the OER in acid by employing electrochemical experiments with in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to understand the dynamic nature of this material at both short and long time scales. We observe initial intrinsic OER activity improvement with electrochemical cycling as well as an initial increase of Ir oxidation state under OER conditions via in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy. We discover that the SrIr0.8Zn0.2O3 perovskite experiences an OER-induced metal to insulator transition (MIT) with extensive electrochemical cycling, caused by surface reorganization and changes to the material crystallinity that occur with exposure to an acidic and oxidizing environment. Our novel identification of an OER-induced MIT for iridate perovskites reveals an additional stability concern for iridate catalysts which are known to experience material dissolution challenges; this work ultimately aims to inform future catalyst material design for PEM water electrolysis applications.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000672592000028	34161089

Herein, the successful synthesis of mesoporous heteroatom-doped carbon-supported NiFe phosphide (FeNi2P@HDC) from Ni-coagulated iron sludge by forming a biogenic precursor via incubation of the sludge with Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, followed by a simple pyrolysis process, is reported. The incubation results in the formation of a solid chemical bonding between bacteria and the surface of the newly formed mineral, which is beneficial for producing a desirable microstructure and chemical composition. The as-synthesized FeNi2P@HDC shows a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, evident from the data, including a low overpotential of 280mV to reach a current density of 10mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 56mVdec(-1) under alkaline conditions, which is comparable with that of the majority of the reported Ni and/or Fe phosphide catalysts in the literature and better than the state-of-the-art RuO2 catalyst. Such a good performance seems to be the result of the synergistic effect of the intrinsic activity of FeNi2P nanoparticles and the strong interaction between FeNi2P and heteroatom-doped graphene-like carbon support.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000494165400001

Although most OER catalysts are based on crystalline mixed-metal oxides, high activities can also be achieved with amorphous phases. Methods for producing amorphous materials, however, are not typically amenable to mixed-metal compositions. We demonstrate that a low-temperature process, photochemical metal-organic deposition, can produce amorphous (mixed) metal oxide films for OER catalysis. The films contain a homogeneous distribution of metals with compositions that can be accurately controlled. The catalytic properties of amorphous iron oxide prepared with this technique are superior to those of hematite, whereas the catalytic properties of a-Fe100-y-zCoyNizOx are comparable to those of noble metal oxide catalysts currently used in commercial electrolyzers.									1129	43	0	0	77	0	1143			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000317061100043	23539180

When directly used as a self-supported working electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), it can afford an impressive electrocatalytic performance with required overpotentials of 227 and 253 mV to achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, much outperforming the benchmark of RuO2 and most state-of-the-art noble-metal-free catalysts. Characterizations demonstrated that the combination of the unique nanostructure of the catalyst and the strong coupling effect between Ni and Fe active sites should be responsible for its excellent OER performance. Remarkably, when coupled with a Pt electrode in an overall water splitting system, they only needed 1.537 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The facile and economical methodology represents a new way to design and prepare high-performance self-supporting MOF electrocatalysts for highly efficient electrochemical processes.									178	8	0	0	8	0	179			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000458339800017

This work introduces a highly active and stable OER catalyst which is based on a core-shell architecture by covering a monodispersed layer of iridium nanoparticles on the core of TiO2 using a one-step polyol reduction method. The monolayer of iridium coating is substantiated by analyzing the accurate loading from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) combined with morphology/size from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and the theoretical model of the most-dense arrangement of iridium nanoparticles on TiO2 surface. The conductive network constructed by interconnected iridium nanoparticles on the surface together with full participation of iridium atoms in the catalytic reaction benefitting from the less than 2 nm size and monolayer adsorption of iridium nanoparticles endow the catalyst with extremely high OER activity (486 A g(Ir)(-1) at 1.5 V vs RHE) and stability (100 h at 10 mA cm(-2)). This work shows a new way to prepare iridium-based electrocatalysts with high mass activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2365-6549			WOS:000696553100023

Here, we report a new and facile strategy for controllable synthesis of high-valence Mo modified FeNiV oxides as efficient OER catalysts. The Mo-dopant displays a significant influence on the valence state of Fe species in the catalysts, which lead to tunable OER performance. When the feed ratio of Mo-dopant is 5%, the Mo-modified FeNiV oxide shows the best OER performance in terms of low overpotential (237 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), Tafel slope (38 mV per decade), and high mass activity, which exceeds its counterparts and most reported OER catalysts. Furthermore, by assembling the catalyst with a carbon fiber cloth, the fabricated water-splitting device exhibits excellent activity and long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte compared with commercial catalysts equipped device. This work not only provides a series of Mo-modified FeNiV-based oxides as high-performance OER catalysts but also offers a new pathway to tune the charge states of OER active centers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2524-7921	2524-793X		WOS:000764598100002

This work demonstrates the in situ conversion of NiCo-LDH (LDH: double-layer hydroxide) into an Fe-doped NiCo-MOF on a conductive substrate (Fe-NiCo-MOF/NF) by a two-step hydrothermal method. The hierarchical book-like structure of the Fe-NiCo-MOF/NF electrode provides a large electro-active surface and improved electron transport capability, leading to enhanced oxygen evolution performance in an alkaline environment. Specifically, Fe-NiCo-MOF/NF needs an overpotential of 290 mV to drive a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), which is 136 mV lower than that of the precursor NiCo-LDH. Additionally, its activity can be maintained for at least 20 h at a high current density of 200 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the real active centers of the catalyst were discovered to be the metal oxides converted during the OER cycles. This work used a simple hydrothermal method to enhance the OER performance, which is convenient for direct application of MOF materials in electrocatalysis fields.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000709008800001

The deterioration of capacity dominated by Mn dissolution makes LiMn2O4 a representative case for studying the evolution of interfaces. Here, we use the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) method to simulate the interface reaction between the ethylene carbonate (EC) molecules and the (110) surface of completely delithiated LiMn2O4 where most severe Mn dissolution is observed in the experiment. It is found that the intrinsic oxygen loss on the surface will drive the initial migration of surface Mn atoms to the electrolyte while reducing them. The EC molecules will decompose after transferring electrons to the surface Mn atoms, and its decomposition products further promote the Mn dissolution. In addition, oxygen loss and EC decomposition are in a competitive relationship when transferring electrons to the surface Mn atoms. This work provides a complete picture of the step-by-step dissolution of Mn atoms along with the interfacial evolution in the spinel LiMn2O4 system and also provides a scope for the study of transition-metal dissolution in other cathode materials and electrolytes.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000648513000016	33874720

Herein, endowing the nickel-iron phosphide (NiFeP) nanoprisms with the tunable electronic structures have been carried out by tailoring the energy level of d-band in our study. The bimetallic synergistic effect efficiently accelerates the formation and cleavage rates of M-O bonding, enabling the greatly improved OER catalytic performance after doping Fe into Ni2P. The large surface area benefiting from the porous architecture also facilitates more contact between electrocatalyst and alkaline electrolytes, resulting in an advanced OER activity. Therefore, NiFeP can drive the OER process with a low potential of 258 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH solution. The present work provides the bimetallic phosphide nanoprism electrocatalyst with the tailored electronic structure for further application relevant to renewable energy exploration.

TPO tests with different sample loads, oxygen fractions and heating rates were carried out to study the influence of the experimental parameters on the sharp peak. The results show that the sharp peak is not caused by heat and mass transfer limitations, but by the intrinsic oxidation kinetics of the carbon black. The evolution of the specific surface area during the intrinsic kinetic controlled oxidation process was then analyzed using isothermal oxidation at low temperatures which showed that the sharp peak is caused by the increase of the specific surface area. The pore structure changes greatly influence the oxidation process when the reaction is controlled by the intrinsic kinetics. When there were no heat and mass transfer limitations, the different oxidation processes result in the same specific surface area evolution.									4	2	0	0	0	0	6			1006-9321			WOS:000266094600009

Contribution of solid electrochemical techniques to high temperature oxidation studies								Materials at High Temperatures								471	81						2000	2000	Solid electrochemical techniques have been applied to high temperature oxidation studies in experiments and concept. The principles of the parabolic oxidation law and solid electrolyte cells have been derived from the same origin developed by Carl Wagner. Oxygen sensors and pumps using solid electrolyte cells are very useful for the study of oxidation kinetics as a function of oxygen partial pressure. A tip-type solid electrolyte CO2 sensor is very sensitive to detect the evolution of CO2 gas, and is useful for the analysis of high temperature oxidation of metal carbides.

It is still unresolved if the layered two-dimensional (2D) structure allows for active catalytic sites to exist below the traditional electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, we utilized the surface interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SI-SECM) to directly measure active site densities in situ. We determined that Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH LDH showed a 10-fold increase in the active site density compared to rock salt Ni-0.8:Fe-0.2 oxide, giving direct evidence that water and hydroxide in the interlayer are able to create stable Ni-IV/Fe-IV active species at layers below the electrode/electrolyte interface. This result suggests that electrolyte permeability of the 2D LDH structure is a major contributor for its increased catalytic activity. Amorphous Ni-0.8:Fe-0.2 oxide also exhibits an anomalously high active site density and higher activity than Ni0.8Fe0.2OOH LDH.									16	3	0	0	1	0	17			2574-0962			WOS:000458705400004

In this research work, we developed nanocarbon protected cobalt sulfide, selenide and telluride (core-shell Co9S8@NC, CoSe@NC and CoTe@NC) using solvent and catalyst free auto-pressurized (Swagelok) solid-state thermolysis method and introduced as active and stable OER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte. In 1 M KOH aqueous solution, the nickel foam supported Co9S8@NC shows the highest OER activity with an over-potential of 288 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is 33 and 68 mV lower than that of CoSe@NC and CoTe@NC electrocatalysts, respectively. In addition, the Co9S8@NC exhibits small Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1) calculated from the low current density region (10 mAcm(-2)) and increases to 120 mV dec(-1) at high current densities region (100 mAcm(-2)). All three electrocatalysts show good stability with negligible potential loss at a static OER current density of 10 mAcm(-2). The obtained results with electrochemical active surface area revealed that the thin carbon layer coating controls nanostructure formation together with liable utilization and strong protection of active sites from the harsh electrolyte conditions, thereby providing constructive activity and stability.

This study presents the synthesis, characterisation, electrochemical testing and performance rationalisation of cobalt phosphide modified with aluminium as an improved catalyst for alkaline oxygen evolution. The electrodes were prepared by gas phase phosphorisation of Al-sputtered Co foam, and characterised by SEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, HAADF-STEM and Raman spectroscopy. Al modification enhances the oxygen evolution performance of the anodes, with a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) reached at an overpotential of 360 mV, representing a 50 mV improvement compared to the Al-free sample. Double layer capacitance measurements indicate that the performance enhancement results from an approximately four-fold increase in relative electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) in the Al-modified sample. In situ Raman spectroscopy rationalises this ECSA increase on the grounds of an Al-induced preference for a spinel phase Co/Al oxide on the catalyst surface upon exposure to electrolyte solution, the compact crystal structure of which causes shrinkage and surface cracking. This contrasts with previous observations on Al-doped nickel phosphides, where an increase in surface area was attributed to Al dissolution. These results present a route for achieving high current density oxygen evolution without the need to alter the catalyst active species, as well as demonstrate the importance of in situ techniques for rationalising performance improvements resulting from subtle differences in surface chemistry.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000530288800006

Here, integration of controllable partial substitution of zinc (Zn) with amine incorporation into CdS-amine inorganic-organic hybrids is used to generate highly efficient electrocatalysts for synthesizing syngas with tunable CO/H-2 ratios (0-19.7), which are important feedstocks for the Fischer-Tropsch process. Diethylenetriamine could enhance the adsorption and accelerate the activation of CO2 to form the key intermediate COOH* for CO formation. Zn substitution promoted the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to tunable CO/H-2 ratios. Importantly, syngas and dihydroisoquinoline can be simultaneously synthesized by pairing with anodic semi-oxidation of tetrahydroisoquinoline in a ZnxCd1-xS-Amine parallel to Ni2P two-electrode electrolyzer.									56	7	0	0	6	0	57			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000497099900001	31664781

This work predicts extremely high catalytic activity of transition metal (Fe, Co, and Ni) promoted two-dimensional MXenes, fully oxidized vanadium carbides (V2CO2), for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The first-principle calculations show that the introduction of transition metal can greatly weaken the strong binding between hydrogen and oxygen and engineer the hydrogen adsorption free energy to the optimal value approximate to 0 eV by choosing the suitable type and coverage of the promoters as well as the active sites. Strain engineering on the performance of transition metal promoted V2CO2 further reveals that the excellent HER activities can maintain well while those poor ones can be modulated to be highly active. This study provides new possibilities for cost-effective alternatives to Pt in HER and for the application of 2D MXenes.									214	16	0	0	11	0	217			2198-3844			WOS:000387649100011	27980992

Herein, metal borides assisted synthesis of graphene-based material (Ni-B/G) has been carried out by facile and fast microwave heating method and applied to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution. The Ni-B combining with 2D graphene give rise to highly efficient HER performance with low overpotential of 187 mV at current density of 10 mA cm-2. In addition, it exhibits good stability and retains 76% of current density after continuous oxygen release. The excellent performance is ascribed to the synergetic effect of Ni-B and graphene. The Ni-B not only acts as initiator to adsorb microwave energy but also works as active centre of catalyst. The high conductivity and large specific area of graphene offer accessible contact between electrolyte and intermediates. Therefore, Ni-B/G indicates a promising candidate for HER in alkaline media.					9th Annual International Conference on Material Science and Environmental Engineering (MSEE 2021)9th Annual International Conference on Material Science and Environmental Engineering (MSEE 2021)	26-28 Nov. 202126-28 Nov. 2021		Nanjing, ChinaNanjing, China	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6596			INSPEC:21994664

Herein, a series of small-sized non-noble metal-based HEO nanoparticles composed of five transition metal elements of Fe, Co, Ni, Cr, and Mn are synthesized via a simple solvothermal strategy followed by different-temperature heat treatment. The HEO treated at 400 degrees C exhibits the best catalytic activity with an overpotential of 288 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and outstanding stability (potential change of only 1.3% after a 95 h OER test at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming the commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts. The excellent catalytic performance, including the low overpotential, fast dynamics, and superb long-term durability, is mainly attributed to the advantages of the large number of active sites provided by ultra-small nanoparticles, the synergistic effect of various catalytically active metal elements, and the entropy stabilization effect. Therefore, this work enriches the selection of high-entropy oxide elements, provides an idea for solving the current problems of traditional methods, and develops a prospective material for OER catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000760410900001

In this study, we present a simple micro-kinetic model of these competing reactions over a platinum catalyst under a strong reducing potential at varying proton concentrations in a non-aqueous solvent. The model provides some insight into the mechanism of reaction and suggests that low proton concentration and a high fraction of stepped sites is likely to improve selectivity to multi-carbon products.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000537175100076	32296799

Here, we discovered a series of TM-IrO2 catalysts have a common activity trend for these oxidation reactions, and their activities are closely related with modified electronic states of IrO2, strongly affected by the types of the transition metal across the periodic table. For all oxidation reactions, Cr- and Mn-IrO2 achieved the highest oxidation catalytic activity, and sequentially decreased activities were obtained with Fe, Co, and Ni doped IrO2. For instance, the highest OER activity was achieved by Cr or Mn doping exhibiting the smallest overpotential eta = 275-230 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), while Ni- IrO2 showed rather larger overpotential (q = 347 mV) even compared with non-doped eta = 314 mV). Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy and high-resolution photoemission spectra of TM- IrO2 indicated dopant metals modified the IrO2 interaction and thus increasing oxygen vacancy defects in IrO2. Strongly positive correlation was observed between the catalytic activities and vacancy states. The amount of defect related signals was observed the most for Cr- or Mn-IrO2, less so for Fe- or Co-IrO2, and unnoted for Ni-IrO2 compared with bare IrO2. Based on these catalytic activities and surface spectroscopic analysis results, vacancy defects induced by doping in TM-IrO2 NPs are proposed to contribute to enhance the oxidation activities.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2045-2322			WOS:000449945000019	30425306

Herein, a high-performing Fe-doped MoNi alloy catalyst (M-H-MoNiFe-50) abundant with flower-like nanorods assemblies has been prepared by high-pressure microwave reaction and hydrogen reduction. Firstly, Fe doped NiMoO4 precursor (M-MoNiFe-50) was synthesized by microwave fast heating, ensuring the robustness of nanorods, which owns larger area and improved catalytic activity than that by conventional hydrothermal method. Secondly, M-MoNiFe-50 was reduced in H-2/Ar to fabricate Fe-incorporated MoNi4 alloys (M-H-MoNiFe-50), greatly enhancing the conductivity and facilitating hydrogen/oxygen spillover. The final M-H-MoNiFe-50 exhibits remarkable activity for alkaline/acidic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotential of 208 (alkaline), 254 (acid) and 347 mV at 1,000 mA.cm(-2). Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer is established using M-H-MoNiFe-50 as anode and cathode, generating a current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) at 1.58 V with encouraging durability of 50 h at 1,000 mA.cm(-2). The extraordinary water splitting performance can be chalked up to the large surface area, favorable charge transfer, modified electron distribution, intrinsic robustness as well as an efficient gas spillover of M-H-MoNiFe-50. The final electrocatalyst has great prospects for practical application and confirms the significance of Fe doping, microwave method and spillover effect for catalytic performance improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000782173200001

In addition, its magnetic properties and electrocatalytic performance for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were fully investigated. X-ray diffraction and Mo spacing diaeresis ssbauer spectroscopy analyses characterized the formation of Fe-Ni alloys in the following coatings: Fe89Ni11, Fe69Ni31, Fe47Ni53, and Fe28Ni72. The magnetic measurements showed that all electrodeposits presented low coercivity, characterizing the coatings as soft magnetic materials. The Fe coating presented the best electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER in 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH and at 298.15 K. However, the Fe coating detached from the substrate when it was submitted to a long-term test. Among the FexNi(1-x) coatings, the Fe89Ni11 coating displayed the best performance for HER since it exhibited the lowest overpotential of 152 mV at an applied current density of 10 mA cm-2. For OER, the Fe69Ni31 and Fe47Ni53 were the best electrocatalysts, which presented the highest exchange current densities about of 7 x 10-4 mA cm-2 and overpotential values around 374 and 377 mV to provide 10 mA cm-2. Furthermore, the Ni and FexNi(1-x) coatings presented good stability in 120 h long term tests at 50 mA cm -2. Finally, the experimental results showed that the manufacture of electrocatalysts based on Fe, Ni and Fe-Ni coatings via electrodeposition conducted in the presence of choline chloride-urea is very promising and environmentally friendly process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000763757600002

Herein, an amorphous and porous 2D NiFeCo hydroxide nanosheets grown on nickel foam (NF) (NiFeCo LDH/NF) by a cost-effective electrodeposition method was explored for efficient electrolytic water splitting and urea electrolysis. Experimental results show that porous confinement in 2D orientation, amorphous nature, and synergistic effect leads to the excellent catalytical performance of the as-prepared 2D NiFeCo LDH/NF electrode for overall water splitting and urea electrolysis. The NiFeCo LDH/NF electrode presents promising behavior for water electrolysis with a small overpotential of 210 mV and 108 mV, respectively, is required for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to gain 10 mA cm(-2). More notably, the bifunctional NiFeCo LDH/NF catalyst, for water electrolysis, needs a lower potential of 1.57 V to gain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 KOH. Furthermore, the electrochemical urea oxidation results show that NiFeCo LDH/NF requires just 0.280 V (vs SCE) to drive 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with a 0.33 M urea, whereas urea-mediated electrolysis cells require a very low potential of 1.49 V at 10 mA cm(-2). The present results provide remarkable and notable insights into the preparation of non-noble and highly efficient 2D transition metal hydroxide electrocatalysts with performances that allow them to compete for widespread use in various applications.									117	4	0	0	2	0	117			2168-0485			WOS:000470331800035

Despite great efforts, exploring cheap and unique design nanostructured materials for efficient electrocatalysis remains a big challenge. Here, we synthesize a porous co-doped carbon decorated with Co3O4 nanoparticles from pyrolysis of a camphor sulfonic acid and metal-organic framework hybrid. The uniformly self-decorated Co3O4 nanoparticles on N, S co-doped carbon layers (denoted as Co3O4/NSC) offer fast ion/electron transport and thus make the material an excellent oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. The resulting Co3O4/NSC shows an onset potential of 1.41 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and delivers an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.49 V vs. RHE, demonstrating fast kinetics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1), making it superior to many state-of-the-art cobalt oxide-based catalysts recently reported in the literature.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000436516700054

Applying a two-step solid state reaction in which SrTiO3 acted as a perovskite-type host produced core/shell structured SrTiO3:La/Rh, the surface of which was enriched with the dopants. La doping suppressed the formation of oxygen vacancies and inactive Rh4+ species. Under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm), SrTiO3:La/Rh exhibited 3.5 and 3.8 times higher rates of H-2 evolution in an aqueous methanol solution and during redox-free Z-scheme overall water splitting in combination with Ir/CoOx/Ta3N5, respectively, compared to SrTiO3:Rh.

Here, we synthesized a genomic DNA-guided porous Cu-2(OH)PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O rolling pin shape composite structure in one pot. The nucleation and development of the porous rolling pin shape Cu-2(OH)PO4/Co-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O composite was controlled and stabilized by the DNA biomolecules. This porous rolling pin shape composite was explored towards electrocatalytic water oxidation for both OER and HER as a bi-functional catalyst. The as-prepared catalyst exhibited a very high OER and HER activity compared to its various counterparts in the absence of an external binder (such as Nafion). The synergistic effects between Cu and Co metals together with the porous structure of the composite greatly helped in enhancing the catalytic activity. These outcomes undoubtedly demonstrated the beneficial utilization of the genomic DNA-stabilised porous electrocatalyst for OER and HER, which has never been observed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000750440800001	35425395

Comprehending catalytic mechanisms in the OER process is of key relevance for the design of efficient catalysts. In this study, two types of Co based MOF with different organic ligands (ZIF-67 and CoBDC; BDC=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) are synthesized as OER electrocatalysts and their electrochemical behavior is studied in alkaline solution. Physical characterization indicates that ZIF-67, with tetrahedral Co sites, transforms into alpha-Co(OH)(2) on electrochemical activation, which provides continuous active sites in the following oxidation, whereas CoBDC, with octahedral sites, evolves into beta-Co(OH)(2) through hydrolysis, which is inert for the OER. Electrochemical characterization reveals that Co sites coordinated by nitrogen from imidazole ligands (Co-N coordination) are more inclined to electrochemical activation than Co-O sites. The successive exposure and accumulation of real active sites is responsible for the gradual increase in activity of ZIF-67 in OER. This work not only indicates that CoMOFs are promising OER electrocatalysts but also provides a reference system to understand how metal coordination in MOFs affects the OER process.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000667320900001	34101996

Herein, we replace the OER with more favorable glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), that is glucose electrolysis in alkaline environment, which requires a much lower cell voltage than that of water electrolysis. The surface of porous Co-Ni alloy on carbon cloth is partial oxidized, serving as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both GOR and HER. The active sites, conductivity, intrinsic activity and stability can be synergistically improved with the engineered porous Co-Ni alloy on carbon cloth. In result, the cell voltage is as low as 1.39 V when the current density reaches to 10 mA cm(-2) in glucose electrolysis. While without the glucose in the electrolyte, the voltage reaches as high as 1.65 V. This work can make a contribution to develop the other highly active and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for glucose or similar organic molecular electrolysis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, its use is limited due to its slower surface reaction kinetics leading to undesired carrier recombination. Herein, we propose the design of highly surface reactive and noble metal free VS2 nanoflowers onto an in situ grown WO3 photoanode as a heterojunction strategy for efficient charge separation. VS2, a promising transition metal-based material with active sites both on the edge and basal planes, reduces the surface charge recombination and enhances the kinetics of the O-2 evolution reaction at the photoanode and electrolyte interface. A significant increment in photocurrent density is observed for the WO3-VS2 composite compared to the bare WO3 with an increase in charge carrier density from 2.5 x 10(21) for WO3 to 1.5 x 10(22) cm(3) for WO3-VS2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicates an effective reduction in charge transfer resistance from 7.71 x 10(5) for WO3 to 2.79 x 10(3) omega for WO3-VS2. A faradaic efficiency of 87% is indicative that the oxygen generated in the reaction is mainly due to the photoelectrochemical water oxidation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000498612600023

We therefore utilize a MoS2 catalyst deposited on porous Ni foam as both the anode and cathode in a two-electrode electrolysis setup. After 12 h of constant galvanostatic electrolysis at 100 mA, the Fe impurities from the KOH electrolyte were successfully removed, as confirmed by means of inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis. In the purified KOH, a Ni-Co3O4 composite oxide catalyst showed no Fe-induced activation. In contrast, we directly observed the uptake of Fe on the Ni-Co3O4 catalyst from the nontreated electrolyte during catalyst operation using a coupled spectroelectrochemical setup. Interestingly, we further identified an influence on the dissolution behavior of Ni and Co in the presence of Fe impurities. Whereas hitherto mainly the activation effect of Fe impurities has been discussed, we hereby show that they additionally suppress corrosion under reaction conditions. Using our fast and low-cost method for the purification of large amounts of electrolyte, catalyst materials can be widely studied without these additional effects induced by Fe impurities in commercial KOH.									31	1	0	0	0	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000485090400051

Specifically, mixed Fe-Ni diphosphide was prepared by sputtering a 200-nm-thick layer of Permalloy onto carbon paper gas diffusion layer followed by gas transport phosphorization reaction. The mass density of the resultant diphosphide phase was established to be approximate to 1.1 mg/cm(2). Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis shows that the actual elemental composition of the resultant ternary electrocatalyst is approximately Fe0.2Ni0.8P2, while the powder X-ray diffraction analysis confirms that the electrocatalyst crystallizes in NiP2 cubic pyrite-like structure. As a cathode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes, this earth-abundant electrode has exchange current densities of 6.84 x 10(-3) and 3.16 x 10(-3) mA/cm(2) and Tafel slopes of 55.3 and 72.2 mV/dec, respectively. As an anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte, the electrode shows an exchange current density of 2.88 x 10(-4) mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 49.3 mV/dec. The observed high activity of the electrode correlates well with its electronic structure, which was assessed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The stability of Fe0.2Ni0.8P2 electrocatalyst in HER and OER was evaluated by means of accelerated degradation test and chronopotentiometry. The results of these experiments elucidate partial dissolution and entire chemical transformation of Fe0.2Ni0.8P2 as the main mechanisms of the electrode degradation during HER and OER, respectively. Overall, our findings could facilitate the composition-based design of active, stable, and durable phosphide electrodes for electrochemical water splitting.									45	2	0	0	1	0	47			1932-7447			WOS:000381236100029

In this study, a CoS2/Cu2S heterostructured composite (CoS2/Cu2S-NF) supported by the porous carbon nanofibers is synthesized as a high-efficiency oxygen reaction electrocatalyst. As indicated from in-situ characterization methods (infrared, Raman and XRD) integrated with the density functional theory results, the heterostructures exhibited by CoS2 and Cu2S could be regulated. The results show that the electron transfer/interaction between CoS2 and Cu2S in the heterojunction were regulated, as well as the electronic structures of Co and Cu sites. As impacted by the structural engineering and the electronic modulation, the activity was enhanced, and the performance of electrocatalytic oxygen reactions was improved, which exhibited the lowest potential difference for (Delta E = 0.73 V) compared with commercial electrocatalysts. The liquid ZAB in accordance with on CoS2/Cu2S-NF exhibited a stable charge and discharge capacity up to 590 h and a great power density reaching 260.60 mW cm(-2). Moreover, the flexible solid-state ZAB based on CoS2/Cu2S-NF exhibited a great competitive power density (92.06 mW cm(-2)), robust flexibility and an obvious integration. As compared with single metal sulfide-NF, the Density functional theory calculations (DFT) highlight the adsorption on CoS2/Cu2S-NF side surface in the heterojunction, which more specifically demonstrates the synergistic effect in the junction. This work presents a direction for designing heterostructured junctions as electrocatalyst and moreover its great application potential in rechargeable metal-solid batteries.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720473800005

Herein, strongly coupled hybrid of watermelon-like RhxSy@C nanospheres has been rationally designed and synthesized via a one-step solvothermal method. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that the rhodium element presents in a mixture phase of metallic Rh and three sulfides, i.e., Rh17Sl5, Rh3S4 and Rh2S3. The ratio of the constituent phases, Rh/Rh17Sl5/Rh3S4/Rh2S3, is closely related to the synthesis parameter, and the average S/Rh molar ratio increases along with the increasing solvothermal temperature and duration. When assessed as electrocatalysts for ORR in hydrochloric acid, the RhxSy/C composite with a constituent of 29.1% Rh17S15, 45.8% Rh3S4 and 25.1% Rh2S3, where the ORR-active Rh17S15 and Rh3S4 phases are up to 75%, exhibits the best catalytic activity and stability, even outperforms Pt/C. In contrast, the metallic Rh-involved counterpart suffers from severe degradation in the highly corrosive environment, and the inactive Rh2S3 phase-dominant composite is less active toward ORR. Our results may give a new impetus to the rational design of rhodium sulfides with improved performance for hydrochloric acid electrolysis.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000405306300022

In this paper, two-dimensional (Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 nanosheet arrays vertically growing on iron foam are simply synthesized via an in situ construction strategy. (Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 features a self-supporting structure with numerous mesopores. As an OER catalyst, (Fe,Ni)(3)S-4 obtained at 110 degrees C ((Fe,Ni)(3)S-4-110) not only exhibits excellent OER activity but also superior reaction stability even at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Besides, the excellent reaction kinetics of the self-supporting electrodes are also demonstrated via Tafel plots and C-dl calculations. The excellent OER performance of the self-supporting Ni-Fe sulfides is mainly ascribed to the excellent mesopore-containing 2D nanosheets assembled in the self-supporting structure and the combined advantages of the binary metal species, which obviously improved the mass transfer and intrinsic properties. This simple synthetic strategy is conducive to establishing self-supporting catalysts, which can be widely applied in the energy conversion field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000782139000001

Galvanostatically charged (fully oxidized, delta approximate to 0) Bi0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta was shown to exhibit record OER specific activity exceeding not only LaxSr1-xCoO3-delta but also oxidized SrCoO3-delta, one of the most active oxide OER catalysts reported so far. The enhanced OER kinetics of the oxidized Bi0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta is attributed to greater hydroxide affinity facilitating the deprotonation of surface bound intermediates due to the presence of strong Lewis acidic A-site Bi3+ ions. In addition, no amorphization or compositional change was observed for the surface of the fully oxidized Bi0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta after OER, where high structural stability is attributed to the higher Fermi level relative to the O 2p band center of Bi0.2Sr0.8CoO3-delta than that of SrCoO3-delta as evidenced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work provides a novel example in the design of highly active oxide catalysts for OER by leveraging the inductive effect.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000526396900011

At present, considerable efforts have been devoted to design and develop robust catalysts for efficient hydrogen generation through water splitting. To further decrease the energy consumption and lower the cost of the catalysts, it demands earth-abundant metal-based catalysts as alternatives to catalyze the water splitting. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) composed of metal nodes and organic linkers have been illustrated to be efficient for water splitting, because of their large specific surface area and tunable composition. Recent progress in the pure MOFs and their composites toward water splitting is summarized and strategies to boost the catalytic performance of MOFs are also introduced. Finally, the current challenges and future aims of pure MOFs-based catalysts toward water splitting are proposed. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Excellent semiconductor/cocatalyst interface matching reduces the recombination ratio of photogenerated carriers. Because of the lower overpotential and faster hole injection rate, BiVO4/CoFe-NiOOH photoanodes exhibit excellent PEC performance: photocurrent of 1.54 mA/cm(2) [at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 41.97% (at 420 nm), bias photon-to-current efficiency of 0.243% (at 0.3 V vs RHE), hole injection efficiency of 35.7% (at 1.23 V vs RHE), hydrogen evolution rate of 0.0157 mu mol.cm(-2).min(-1), and oxygen evolution rate of 0.0089 mu mol.cm(-2).min(-1).

In order to improve the electrocatalytic activity and electron/mass transfer efficiency, it is necessary to develop OER electro-catalyst with optimized electronic structure, porous morphology, and high conductivity. Herein, we present a novel carbon nanotubes (CNT)-interconnected, FeP/Ni2P heterostructure-embedded nanospindles (FeP/Ni2P@CNT) as an advanced OER catalyst. Due to the effective charge transfer via electronic structure modulation in FeP/Ni2P heterostructure, superior electrical conductivity of existing CNTs network, inevitable active catalytic sites exposure by ultrafine FeP/Ni2P heterostructural-nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm), and the porous nanostructure facilitated gas bubbles release, the FeP/Ni2P@CNT catalyst displays exceptional OER activity. In particular, the FeP/Ni2P@CNT hybrid catalyst requires only 240 mV overpotential to reach the benchmark current density of 10 mA/cm(2), which outperforms the activity of commercial RuO2 and most recently reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts.

Lead alloys with cobalt additives								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				146	4			1361	1369		10.1149/1.1391771				APR 1999	1999	Lead alloys, such as lead-calcium-tin and lead-silver, are the primary insoluble anodes used in the electrowinning of metals. While some difficulties are encountered in their use, there is no obvious replacement that is economically and technically competitive. Two of the specific problems with led include decreased cathode purity due to incorporation from corrosion products and the relatively high overpotential which increases cell voltage. To gain an improved understanding of the fundamental behavior of lead anodes, the polarization behavior of six different alloys in sulfuric acid was evaluated. Some tests were also made with Co(II) in the acid sulfate electrolyte. Notable differences were found in the multiple activation-passivation cycles, stability, and relative activity for oxygen evolution for the alloys, and the relative trends in behavior were established. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were also conducted at selected potentials. Overall, the data show that the electrochemical response, particularly the degree of polarization for the oxygen evolution reaction, of the lead alloy anodes are dependent on the surface phases and structures present. The ability to depolarize the anode reaction using Co(II) was particularly sensitive to the lead composition. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(98)08-054-9.

The native sulfur content in the camellia flower facilitates in situ self-doping of sulfur, which highly activates the camellia-driven biochar (SA-Came) as a multifunctional catalyst with the enhanced electron-transfer ability and long-term durability. For water splitting, an SA-Came-based electrode is highly stable and shows reaction activities in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, with overpotentials of 154 and 362 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. For supercapacitors, SA-Came achieves a specific capacitance of 125.42 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and high cyclic stability in a three-electrode system in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. It demonstrated a high energy density of 34.54 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 1600 W kg(-1) as a symmetric hybrid supercapacitor device with a wide working potential range of 0-1.6 V.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2637-9368		WOS:000789518200001

In this study, we employed operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the interfacial dynamics at the alpha-Fe2O3/NiFeOOH interface. We uncovered the spontaneous formation of a FeOOH interfacial layer under (photo)electrochemical conditions. This FeOOH interfacial layer plays a role in the surface passivation of hematite and in accumulating the (photo)generated holes upon external potential application. This hole-accumulation process leads to the extraction of more (photo)generated holes from hematite before releasing them to NiFeOOH to carry out the water-splitting reaction, and it also explains the reason for the delay in the nickel oxidation process. Based on these observations, we propose a model where NiFeOOH acts mainly as an OER catalyst and a facilitator of holes extraction from hematite, while the interfacial FeOOH layer acts as a surface passivation and hole-accumulation overlayer.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000704700800049		
J	Li, Lulu; Chang, Xin; Lin, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Zhi-Jian; Gong, Jinlong								Theoretical insights into single-atom catalysts								CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS				49	22			8156	8178		10.1039/d0cs00795a				NOV 21 2020	2020	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with atomically dispersed metals have emerged as a new class of heterogeneous catalysts and have attracted considerable interest because they offer 100% metal atom utilization and show excellent catalytic behavior compared with traditionally supported nano-particles. However, it is challenging to explore the active sites and catalytic mechanisms of SACs through common characterization methods due to the isolated single atoms. Therefore, employing theoretical calculations to determine the nature of SACs' active sites and the reaction mechanisms is particularly meaningful. This paper describes the nature of SACs by summarizing the diverse applications and properties of SACs, which starts from computational simulation on a couple of important applications of SACs. Then the distinctive and fundamental properties of SACs are discussed. At last, the challenges and future perspectives of computational calculations for SACs are outlined.									102	2	0	0	7	1	102			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000590395000009	32870221

Although tantalum hafnium carbides (Ta-Hf-C) have shown outstanding refractory and structural properties, there is no clear role of their electrochemical efficiency. Here we report on the electrochemical activity of such thin films, (Ta2C(100-x)%center dot(Hf2C)( (x)%), x = 100, 70, 30, and 0, deposited by magnetron sputtering. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction showed no evidence of phase segregation, and XPS confirms the well-controlled stoichiometry of the electrodes. The HER kinetics was studied in strong acidic conditions, and it was found that the (Ta2C)(7)(0%)center dot(Hf2C) (30%) was the most active material toward HER in this acid media and displayed an onset overpotential of -198 mV vs NHE and a Tafel slope of 129 mV center dot dec(-l ). Our results suggest that the strong affinity of Hf-C toward oxygen reduction reaction could be responsible for the high catalytic response and strong oxidation resistance of the ternary carbide alloys. Finally, we show that, in fact, the Ta-Hf-C alloys can be competitive materials toward HER.									12	3	1	0	0	0	12			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000449888600029

In this study, low-cost vanadium oxide (VO2) electrocatalysts with nanoribbon-like structure (NRBs) were grown on Ni foam at 140, 180, and 220 degrees C using a microwave-assisted method. The electrochemical properties of the electrocatalysts fabricated at 140, 180, and 220 degrees C (VO-140, VO-180, and VO-220, respectively) were evaluated for the MeOH oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), multi-step chronoamperometry (M-CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analyses (EIS). The VO-180 electrocatalyst presented a high current density of 224 mA cm-2 for MOR and an overpotential of 150 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for OER. The specific surface area and electron transfer rate of VO-180 were higher than those of VO-140 and VO-220. Moreover, the as-synthesized VO-180 electrocatalyst exhibited excellent MOR and OER activity and stability, suggesting its potential applications in direct MeOH fuel cells.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000711077200006

Density functional theory (DFT) methods are used to predict the adsorption free energy of acetate and phosphate anions as a function of Pt(1 1 1) electrode potential. Four models of the electrode potential are used including a simple vacuum slab model, an applied electric field model with and without the inclusion of a solvating water bi-layer, and the double reference model. The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) due to anion adsorption is simulated using the DFT results. The inclusion of solvation at the electrochemical interface is necessary for accurately predicting the adsorption peak position. The Langmuir model is sufficient for predicting the adsorption peak shape, indicating coverage effects are minor in altering the LSV for acetate and phosphate adsorption. Anion adsorption peak positions are determined for solution phase anion concentrations present in microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells and discussion is provided as to the impact of anion adsorption on oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction rates in these devices.

Redox kinetics of nickel oxide foils: Structural evolution and rate-limiting steps								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				207				71	88		10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.05.012				SEP 2019	2019	We examine the redox activity of nickel/nickel oxide foils. Thin nickel foils (2.5 gm, 10 m, and 100 pm) were subjected to redox conditions in a fixed-bed reactor within 800-1000 degrees C, and samples were examined using SEM at different stages of conversion. We identify some key features or the process that are used to guide model development: (1) Oxidation starts with the nucleation of oxide grains, followed by their rapid growth leading to overlap and the attenuation of fast diffusion pathways. (2) Reduction is impacted by the evolution of macro-pores which facilitate gas-oxide contact, and dense metallic clusters that shield the reactants. (3) The transitions between stages during conversion and the characteristics of grains, pores and clusters depend on the sample thickness. Guided by these observations, analytical models are formulated. Oxidation is modeled as a nucleation nucleation-growth process while reduction is characterized by an adsorption-surface reaction process. We extract the corresponding reaction parameters by training the model using the measurements and show that the model formulation captures the controlling mechanisms of the conversion. The oxidation rate is controlled by the rapid decay of oxygen transport across the products layer, and the dependency of the oxides grain structure on the sample thickness contributes to the rate of decay. The reduction rate is largely controlled by the accessibility of lattice oxygen to surface kinetics, and mostly by slow ionic diffusion. While using different foil thicknesses is useful in extracting the kinetics, if used in rapid redox processes applicable to chemical-looping applications, oxygen carriers (foils or other forms) with characteristic active metal thickness of 1 pm are recommended.

A modulation in the annealing treatment time (t) generated the variation in morphology, at a constant temperature (600 degrees C), and the nanorod-like growth on the surfaces was revealed at t >= 3 h. Especially, the IrO2-ZnO composite nanorod array exhibited superior OER catalytic activities (e.g., a potential of 1.481 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (vs RHE) and a Tafel slope of 42.9 mV dec(-1)). Moreover, there was no apparent potential shift with robust long-term cycling stability under acidic conditions, which were much better than those of IrO2 and commercial iridium (cIr) and comparable with those of the previously reported outstanding Ir-based OER catalysts. Considering that the nanorod array was fabricated with the loading of the Zn metal component, which showed generally low catalytic activity and poor durability, this study suggests a promising strategy with an extended synthetic methodology for preparing Zn-mixed metal oxides as highly efficient electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000812995400001

During the development of iron phosphide phases by varying the synthesis conditions such as reaction temperature and time, the HER activities of the nanoparticle were examined.

In this work, electrospun nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (N-CNFs) were prepared to use as supports to anchor iron phthalocyanine (FePc) bifunctional catalyst for oxygen (O-2) electrode in Li-O-2 batteries. By using FePc and N-CNFs, two different bonding composites were fabricated via diazonium reaction by refluxing and physical mixing methods which were resulting into covalent linkage via pyridine (Py) (denoted as FePc/Py/N-CNFs) and noncovalent interaction via pi-pi stacking (denoted as FePc/N-CNFs). The systematic characterizations confirmed that the spun carbon nanofibers were functionalized by pyridine and the anchored FePc molecule donated the axial ligand for the iron (Fe) center in the FePc/Py/N-CNFs composite. The FePc were embedded in the N-CNFs composites combining the electrocatalytic activity of the FePc with ORR/OER processes and N-CNFs with a three-dimensional (3D) interconnected porous network structure through a connecting link of one-dimensional (1D) porous and N-doping carbon nanofiber which exhibited a high performance when acting as the cathode in Li-O-2 batteries. However, the FePc/Py/N-CNFs composite showed the higher catalytic activity and prominent structural stability due to the FePc being strongly interlinked with the N-CNFs through the Py connection, which could avoid the deformation and agglomeration of FePC molecules during cycling and thus possessed the high electrochemical performance of the composite. This study demonstrated the unique design of FePc/Py/N-CNFs composite structure in this work would be found as a promising O-2 electrode material with enhanced electrochemical performance in rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.

J	Nilsson, E; Berendson, J; Fontes, E								Impact of chlorine and acidification in the electrochemical treatment of tumours								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				30	12			1321	1333		10.1023/A:1026560806158				DEC 2000	2000	Electrochemical treatment (EChT) of tumours offers considerable promise as a safe, simple and relatively noninvasive antitumour therapy. When platinum is used as electrode material, the major electrochemical reactions at the anode are chlorine and oxygen evolution. Conflicting opinions can be found in the literature over the role of chlorine in the underlying destruction mechanism behind EChT. In this present study, the impact of chlorine in EChT treatments is investigated by means of mathematical modelling. The analysis focuses on the tissue surrounding a spherical platinum anode when applying a constant current density. Tissue is modelled as an aqueous solution of sodium chloride containing a bicarbonate buffer system and organic constituents susceptible to reactions with chlorine. Except for the case of very low anode current densities, the simulations clearly show that it is the spreading of hydrogen ions - and not chlorine molecules - that determines the extent of tissue destruction around the anode. Moreover, it is found that the reactions of chlorine with tissue play important roles as generators of hydrogen ions. The contribution of these reactions to the acidification of tissue, surrounding the anode, is strongly dependent on the applied current density and increases with decreasing current density.									11	0	0	0	4	0	11			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000165788500001

Due to low electron conductivity of WO3-x, NF as the substitute is a better choice to improve performances of WO3-x nanosheets electrodes. On the other hand, WO3-x with unsaturated valence annealed at 400 degC in Ar/H2 can increase the defect and improve the performances of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As catalyst for HER, WO3-x/NF exhibits better catalytic activity and stability than WO3/NF with overpotentials of 175 mV and 260 mV at the current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 50 mA cm-2, respectively. In addition, WO3-x/NF has superior durability and stability for 105 h in the long-term electrochemical process.

Consequently, the invention of such catalysts is a significant task while facing difficult challenges. Herein, we synthesized different amounts of Fe-doped Co3V2O8 (Co3(1-x)Fe3xV2O8 (0 <= x <= 0.9)) electrocatalysts, in which the 3d electronic structure of Co could be adjusted by changing the content of Fe, as evidenced by the XPS data. As the x-value increased from 0, 0.25, 0.4, to 0.5, the reactivity of the OER continued to increase, while the further increase of the x-value led to its decrease. Among them, Co1.5Fe1.5V2O8 exhibited the best OER characteristics. At 10 mA cm(-2), its overpotential was 290 mV, and its Tafel slope was 32.8 mV dec(-1). The favorable electronic structure of Co adjusted by Fe-doping and the synergy between Co and Fe could endow it with excellent electrochemical properties. This work demonstrated the potential of Co1.5Fe1.5V2O8 as a noble-metal-free OER electrocatalyst with high activity and stability, providing a possible way to construct efficient OER electrocatalysts using doping strategy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000592961700151

NiCe@NiFe/NF-N attains 100 mA/cm(2) at overpotential of 254 mV with Tafel slope of 59.9 mV/dec, which is much lower than that of NiCe@NiFe/NF-P, NiFe@NF, NiCe@NF and also commercial RuO2 electrocatalysts. Furthermore, the obtained NiCe@NiFe/NF-N electrocatalyst only needs overpotential of 359 mV to deliver high current densities of 1 A/cm(2) and demonstrates excellent stability at such large current densities for 20 h, which is also superior to that of NiCe@NiFe/NF-P electrocatalyst. Further study reveals that the enhanced water oxidation performance of NiCe@NiFe/NF-N electrocatalyst with good stability at high current densities could be attributed to the optimal surface and electronic structures, fast reaction kinetics and high intrinsic catalytic activity. Collectively, such electrocatalyst paves new opportunities for development of low-cost water oxidation electrocatalysts with high current densities for practical water splitting applications.									71	5	0	0	2	0	71			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300045

Yet the intrinsic mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces remains largely unclear for the lack of direct evidence of real active phases. Herein, operando ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Raman spectroscopies were used to probe the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH@NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) hybrid catalysts, which revealed that FeOOH@NiFe LDH was converted into highly active FeOOH@ beta-Ni(Fe)OOH phases during the OER process. The FeOOH NiFe LDH interface can promote interfacial charge transfer, delay the Ni oxidation and induce the NiFe LDH phases to highly reactive beta-Ni(Fe)OOH. The FeOOH@ beta-Ni(Fe)OOH exhibited excellent OER performance (252 mV at 100 mA cm(-2)) and a 1.6 times increase (at overpotential of 300 mV) in turnover frequency (TOF) with respect to the active phase gamma-Ni(Fe)OOH of NiFe LDH. This work clarifies that ration interface engineering can regulate the generation of highly active phases in the OER process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000860664200001

Among them, FexCo2-xP/NF shows excellent bifunctional catalytic activities by demonstrating very low oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 255/114mV at a current density of 20/10mAcm(-2) respectively, whereas FexCo3-xO4/NF and FeCo-PBA/NF demand higher overpotentials. Remarkably, for water electrolysis, FexCo2-xP/NF requires only 1.61V to obtain 10mAcm(-2). In contrast to water electrolysis, urea electrolysis reduces overpotential and simultaneously purifies the urea-rich wastewater. The urea oxidation reaction at the FexCo2-xP/NF anode needs just 1.345V to achieve 20mAcm(-2), which is 140mV less than the 1.48V potential required for OER. Moreover, the generation of H-2 through urea electrolysis needs only 1.42V to drive 10mAcm(-2).									38	2	0	0	3	0	39			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000489971400001	31612631

Due to the limited Ir and Ru worldwide availability, one of the main challenges for the GW-scale PEMWE implementation is the loading reduction of these metals in the anodic catalytic layer. Here, IreRu loading (5 wt%Ir-40 wt%Ru) was deposited through their impregnation over TiO2, followed by a thermal-oxidative treatment, obtaining IrRuOx/TiO2 catalyst. SEMEDS and HR-TEM confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of IrRuOx on TiO2. The supported catalyst showed a 1.4-fold higher mass activity (85 mA/mg IreRu) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than a mechanical mixture of IrO2-RuO2 1:3 (54 mA/mgIrthornRu) in-H2SO4 0.5 M, at 1.52 V/RHE. Furthermore, the supported catalyst retains 90% of its catalytic activity after 100 reaction cycles suggesting the RuO2 intermediate species stabilization by IrOx, which can avoid its irreversibly transform into hydrous RuOx.

The as-synthesized MXenes exhibit a variety of surface terminations involving mixtures of O, OH, H, or F surface groups. These terminations play a crucial role in the electrocatalytic performance of these materials as these may change depending on the reaction conditions. The Pourbaix diagrams have long being used to provide the thermodynamically stable surface under certain conditions of pH and potential, U. However, experimental determination of Pourbaix diagrams may be quite challenging while first-principles studies, considering the most likely terminations, allow deriving reliable insights. Here, Pourbaix diagrams for a series of representative MXenes are provided; the Ti2C, Ti3C2, V2C, and Mo2C MXenes, with the novelty of considering single and several double mixed terminations. The possible implications of the obtained results are discussed, especially for a proper choice of models in theoretical electrocatalysis studies, including the water splitting related hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), or the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but also serving as a guide to any further computational studies and also to electrocatalytic experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2513-0390		WOS:000819661700001

Using urea oxidation reaction (UOR) instead of OER has been an energy-saving method because it has a lower theoretical potential and also can reduce pollution. In this paper, NiCoZn LDH/NF, P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-X (X is the atom ratio of P) = 10%, 15%, 20%) were synthesized through typically hydrothermal and calcination methods. P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% was demonstrated to be abifunctional electrocatalyst towards HER and UOR. When P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% is used as the anode and cathode for urea-water electrolysis,it shows that when the current density is 100 mA cm(-2), the voltage is 1.479 V for urea-water electrolysis, which is much better than that of IrO2/NF parallel to Pt/C/NF (1.698 V). Thus, P-NiCoZn LDH/NF-15% is expected to replace precious metals for practical applications. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, low surface area and nonpores in bulk phase generally limit the mass transport and thereby result in unsatisfactory mass activity. Herein, we propose a "molecular-level strategy" with the simultaneous modulation of the ordered pores on the oxygen-deficient sites along with sulfur (S) substitution on oxygen sites at the molecular level to boost the mass transport behavior of perovskite electrocatalyst for enhanced mass activity. As a proof of concept, the elaborately designed brownmillerite oxide Sr2Co1.6Fe0.4O4.8S0.2 (S-BM-SCF) shows approximately fourfold mass activity enhancement in 1M KOH compared with the pristine SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (SCF) perovskite. Comprehensive experimental results, in combination with theoretical calculations, demonstrate that the intrinsic molecular-level pores in the brownmillerite structure can facilitate reactive hydroxyl ion (OH-) uptake into the oxygen-vacant sites and that S doping further promotes OH- adsorption by electronic structure modulation, thus accelerating mass transport rate. Meanwhile, the S-BM-SCF can significantly weaken the resistance of O-2 desorption on the catalyst surface, facilitating the O-2 evolution. This work deepens the understanding of how mass transport impacts the kinetics of the OER process and opens up a new avenue to design high-performance catalysts on the molecular level.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1931-9401			WOS:000630909300002

The Co@NC delivered excellent oxygen evolution activity with an overpotential of merely 248 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with promising long-term stability. The importance of Co encapsulated in NC has further been demonstrated by synthesizing Co nanoparticles without NC shell. The synergy between the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co plays a major role to improve the OER activity, whereas the NC shell optimizes the electronic structure, improves the electron conductivity, and offers a large number of active sites in Co@NC. The density functional theory calculations have revealed that the hcp Co has a dominant role in the surface reaction of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, whereas the fcc phase induces the built-in electric field at the interfaces with N-doped graphene to accelerate the H+ ion transport.

These advantages include a larger array of electrocatalyst available for oxygen evolution, no electrolyte management, and the ability to apply differential pressure. To date, there have been only a handful of reports on solid-state alkaline water electrolyzers using anion exchange membranes (AEMs), and there have been no reports that investigate loss in system performance over time. In this work, a solid-state alkaline water electrolyzer was successfully demonstrated with several types of polysulfone-based AEMs using a relatively expensive but highly active lead ruthenate pyrochlore electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction. The electrolysis of ultrapure water at 50 degrees C resulted in a current density of 400 mA cm(-2) at 1.80 V. We demonstrated that the short-term degradation of water electrolyzer performance over time was largely a consequence of carbon dioxide intrusion into the system and could be easily remedied, while long-term deterioration was a consequence of irreversible AEM polymer degradation.									95	1	0	0	6	0	107			2046-2069			WOS:000331191200067

At present, a common belief is that the solution processability of MOFs can only be improved by functionalization with foreign stabilizers. In this work, we firstly predicted through density functional theory (DFT) that in case of a slight excess of the oxygen percentage of MOFs (similar to 15%), the ionization of additional hydroxyl groups on the surface of MOFs can greatly enhance the solution dispersibility of MOFs through electrostatic stabilization. We consequently demonstrated a general protocol for manipulating MOFs' solution processability through O-2 plasma treatment (0-40 min), which can continuously adjust their surface charge in aqueous dispersions (zeta potentials: -13.3--29.4 mV). This has resulted in a class of "uncapped" MOF aqueous colloids. Further size fractionation of these MOFs in aqueous colloids has produced small-sized MOFs with superior electrocatalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (overpotential of 258 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 19 mV dec(-1), and strong durability up to 100 h).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000854255100001

Practically applicable stability over 12 h of 10% Zn-doped NiO nanocluster electrocatalyst was proposed for efficient electrochemical water splitting applications.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000458662700015

Herein, we report a new type of N-doped carbon coated CoP particle/carbon nanotube composite (CNT-NC-CoP) has been synthesized by in situ nucleation and growth of ZIF-67 nanoparticles onto carbon nanotubes, which subsequently is treated with carbonization and phosphorization. Unique hierarchical structure endows as-obtained CNT-NC-CoP with high specific surface area, abundant exposed active sites, quick ion diffusion path, and good electrical conductivity, thus exhibiting the highest electrocatalytic capability with the low overpotential of 251 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and remaining long-term durability (overlapping LSV curve after 10 h). Besides, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that CoOOH/graphene charged surfaces are more effective for facilitating intermediates adsorption and improving the corresponding catalytic activity.

Using the Escherichia cell mutator strain XL-I Red, we introduced mutations at 14 sites in the large extrinsic loop E of CP 47 and its adjacent transmembrane cu-helix VI. Four mutant cell lines were recovered in which the histidyl residues H-455, H-466 and H-469 were altered. The cell lines H455T, H455Y, H469Y, and the double mutant F432L,H466R exhibited phenotypes that supported the identification of the histidyl residues H-455, H-466 and H-469 as chlorophyll ligands. Four additional mutant cell lines were recovered which contained mutations at positions R-448 in the large extrinsic loop of CP 47. These mutants, R448K, R338Q, R448S, and R448W, exhibited variable phenotypes ranging from moderate alteration of photoautotrophic growth and oxygen evolution rates to a complete inhibition of these parameters. Those mutants exhibiting photoautotrophic growth and oxygen evolution capability under standard conditions were unable to grow photoautotrophically or evolve oxygen when grown at low chloride concentrations. Finally, a mutant cell line exhibiting a substitution at position (342)G was recovered. The mutant G342D exhibited moderate alterations of photoautotrophic growth and oxygen evolution. In addition to these alterations, mutants were recovered in which deletions and insertions (leading to frame shifts) and stop codons were introduced. These mutants uniformly lacked the ability to either grow photoautotrophically or evolve oxygen.									8	0	0	0	7	0	9			0167-4412	1573-5028		WOS:000078933000016	10080703

However, the function of their counter-cations is overlooked. Here, we show that flexible counter-cations of methyltrioctylammonium can trigger polyoxovanadates to transform from octahedrally coordinated H2V10O284- to tetrahedrally coordinated V10O262-.

Herein, a facile cyclic voltammetry method is reported for the autologous growth of a highly integrated and efficient NiFe-OOH catalyst for the OER by electrochemical roughening of Ni foam substrates in 6 M KOH using an iron rod counter electrode. The electrochemical roughening created a nanostructured Ni surface with low interfacial electrical resistance and 25 times higher surface area, accompanied by in situ doping of Fe. Electrochemical characterization revealed that the formed NiFe-OOH catalysts exhibit an extremely low OER onset overpotential of 190 mV and a Tafel slope merely of 48.1 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Furthermore, a NaBH4 reductive treatment was applied to create more surface defects on NiFe-OOH leading to further enhanced catalyst conductivity and a further decrease of the Tafel slope to 34.7 mV dec(-1). The electrode demonstrated prolonged electrochemical and mechanical stability at high current densities in industrial 30 wt% KOH solutions.									18	2	0	0	1	0	18				2052-1537		WOS:000416055500009

J	Kadam, Nishad; Sarkar, A.								A system for recharging Zn-air battery with high reversibility using a water-in-salt electrolyte								JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE				54						105265	10.1016/j.est.2022.105265				OCT 2022	2022	Despite being a subject of interest for a very long time, rechargeable Zn-air batteries suffer from some funda-mental limitations, one of them being plating of zinc. With the introduction of water-in-salt electrolytes, it has become possible to achieve a fairly reversible zinc anode vis-a-vis plating and stripping. In the present work, we propose a twin chamber rechargeable Zn-air battery which utilizes exclusively a water-in-salt electrolyte for the zinc plating reaction, while the oxygen evolution reaction takes place in traditional dilute electrolyte. A third redox couple in the form of two auxiliary electrodes is used to decouple the zinc plating and oxygen evolution reaction. The auxiliary electrodes change their states after charging of each chamber which enables charging of the other chamber after switching of electrolyte positions. The active material for the auxiliary electrodes is chosen to be Na2V6O16 nanofibers. Meanwhile, the discharging can be performed with a dilute electrolyte, similar to a traditional Zn-air battery. The present work aims to demonstrate the operation of the proposed Zn-air battery system and present some insights on electrochemical behavior of Na2V6O16 in both ZnCl2 water-in-salt electrolyte and a ZnSO4 based dilute electrolyte.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-152X	2352-1538		WOS:000836924800008

Herein, an efficient and cost-effective electrode architecture constructed by vertically aligned carbon nanosheets (VCNs) and iron oxyhydroxide/nitride (VCNs@FeOOH//VCNs@Fe4N) is designed and synthesized for water splitting in alkaline medium. Benefiting from the highly exposed active sites, accelerated mass and electron transport, and synergistic effect of multiple components, the composite electrodes deliver unprecedented catalytic performance with high activity and excellent durability. The VCNs@FeOOH composite electrode exhibits an overpotential of as low as 179 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while VCNs@Fe4N shows a low overpotential of 172 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2). More significantly, a full electrolyzer cell with VCNs@Fe4N as the cathode and VCNsgFeOOH as the anode exhibits an appealing operation voltage of 1.6 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with superior durability. The present results provide new insight into designing robust catalysts toward practical water splitting devices and metal-air batteries.									34	2	0	0	1	0	34			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000440105500034

Core oxygen atoms within complex 1 are transferred upon reaction with an oxygen-atom acceptor (PEt3), to give the butterfly complex [Mn4O2{O2P(OtBu)(2)}(6)(OPEt3)(2)]. The cubane structure is restored by reaction of the latter complex with the O-atom donor PhIO. Complex 1 was investigated as a precursor to inorganic Mn metaphosphate/pyrophosphate materials, which were studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy to determine the fate of the Mn4O4 unit. Under the conditions employed, thermolyses of 1 result in reduction of the manganese to Mn-II species.

The latter can serve as complementary efficient electrocatalysts in the hydrogen (HER) versus oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In the OER Ni12P5 shows enhanced performance over Ni2P due to the higher concentration of nickel in this phase, which enables the formation of an amorphous NiOOH/Ni(OH)(2) shell on a modified multiphase with a disordered phosphide/phosphite core. The situation is completely reversed in the HER, where Ni2P displayed a significant improvement in electrocatalytic activity over Ni12P5 owing to a larger concentration of phosphide/phosphate species in the shell. Moreover, the efficiently combined use of the two nickel phosphide phases deposited on nickel foam in overall electrocatalytic water splitting is demonstrated by a strikingly low cell voltage and high stability with pronounced current density, and these catalysts could be an apt choice for applications in commercial alkaline water electrolysis.									256	7	0	0	8	0	257			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200011

By combining a conductive nanostructured scaffold and highly active outer layers, the as-prepared Ni-Mo/Cu nanowires deliver superior hydrogen and oxygen evolution performance. To achieve a 20 mA cm(-2) catalytic current in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, the NM-CNW requires an overpotential of only 152 mV for hydrogen evolution and 280 mV for oxygen evolution. When assembled into a full electrolyzer, the Ni-Mo/Cu nanowires can drive full water splitting at nearly 100% faradaic efficiency steadily up to 12 h without any significant performance decay, and afford a catalytic current close to that of the state-of-the-art Pt-RuO2 system over long-term operation.									61	3	0	0	3	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395309800050

However, its performance is hampered by electron-hole recombination at surface states. Herein, partially oxidized two-dimensional (2D) bismuthene is developed as an effective, stable, functional interlayer between BiVO4 and the archetypal NiFeOOH co-catalyst. Comprehensive (photo)electrochemical and surface photovoltage characterizations show that NiFeOOH can effectively increase the lifetime of photogenerated holes by passivating hole trap states of BiVO4; however, it is limited in influencing electron trap states related to oxygen vacancies (V-O). Loading bismuthene on BiVO4 photoanodes increases the density of V-O that are beneficial for the oxygen evolution reaction via the formation of oxy/hydroxyl-based water oxidation intermediates at the surface. Moreover, bismuthene increases interfacial band bending and fills the V-O-related electron traps, leading to more efficient charge extraction. With the synergistic interaction of bismuthene and NiFeOOH on BiVO4, this composite photoanode achieves a 5.8-fold increase in photocurrent compared to bare BiVO4 reaching a stable 3.4 (+/- 0.2) mA cm(-2) at a low bias of +0.8 V-RHE or 4.7(+/- 0.2) mA cm(-2) at +1.23 V-RHE. The use of 2D bismuthene as functional interlayer provides a new strategy to enhance the performance of photoanodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000849578600001

Incorporation of Ce into CuOx leads to greatly improved OER activity, which reached an optimal value at a surface concentration of 6.9 at% Ce. Specifically, the OER current density at 400 mV overpotential for the most active Ce-modified CuOx catalyst (6.9 at% Ce) was 3.3 times greater compared to the pure CuOx. Coincident with the improved OER activity, Ce incorporation also leads to significant structural changes that manifested in increasing degrees of disorder. A further increase in the Ce concentration led to a decrease in the OER performance which can be attributed to the formation of a segregated CeO2 phase. A strong correlation was observed between the OER performance and tetravalent Ce (Ce4+) ion concentration, up to a concentration corresponding to CeO2 phase segregation. No particular trend was observed for the OER activity of these Ce-modified CuOx catalysts with respect to the surface concentration of Cu ions, surface oxygen species or catalyst structure. The stability of these CuOx catalysts at 5 mA cm(-2) was also improved with Ce incorporation, and the overpotential required to sustain this current density is much lower than that of pure CuOx. Overall, this study provides new insights regarding the promoting effect of tetravalent Ce ions on the OER activity of CuOx-based OER catalysts in alkaline electrolytes.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000417295800003	29134993

The oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) performance of N-doped HMC was evaluated using rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry in an alkaline electrolyte. N-doped HMC demonstrated a high ORR onset potential of -0.055 V (vs. Hg/HgO) and excellent stability.

Sets of homologous proteins that catalyze different overall reactions but share an aspect of catalysis, such as a common partial reaction, are called mechanistically diverse superfamilies. The common mechanistic steps and structural characteristics of several of these superfamilies, including the enolase, Nudix, amidohydrolase, and haloacid dehalogenase superfamilies have been characterized. In addition, studies of mechanistically diverse superfamilies are helping to elucidate mechanisms of functional diversification, such as catalytic promiscuity. Understanding how enzyme superfamilies evolve is vital for accurate genome annotation, predicting protein functions, and protein engineering.									171	0	0	0	149	1	174			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000241652200017	16935022

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the two processes, related to water splitting, over which metal-air batteries run. Since both processes are sluggish, hence, they require a catalyst and since the existing precious-metal based catalysts are selective and expensive, there is a need to find a suitable bifunctional catalyst for the same. Motivated by enhanced structural stability imparted by the polyanionic groups along with many reports on electrocatalytic activity of Cobalt phosphate based materials, we tried to look into the electrocatalytic behavior of Na2CoPO4F and Na4Co3(PO4)(2)P2O7. Both materials were synthesized via solution combustion route resulting in carbon coated and amorphous particles. The ORR/OER properties of the materials were studied in alkaline solution showing bifunctional behavior. An onset potential of 0.854 V and 0.771 V vs. RHE was observed for Na2CoPO4F and Na4Co3(PO4)(2)P2O7 with a current density of 5.84 mA cm(-2) and 3.4 mA cm(-2) respectively. The onset potential during OER was observed to be 1.591 V and 1.596 V vs. RHE for Na2CoPO4F and Na4Co3(PO4)(2)P2O7 respectively. As an application, aqueous Na-air battery was fabricated using Na2CoPO4F as an air-cathode showing good (dis)charge behavior.					63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)	DEC 18-22, 2018DEC 18-22, 2018	Dept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl SciDept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl Sci	Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIAGuru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1851-6	WOS:000504650100598

The catalysts are of crucial importance for the rate of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), among which Pt-based catalysts for ORR have shortcomings in stability and cost, and the kind of catalysts with adding C and N to transition metals receive more attention. Here we analyze catalytic performance of graphene supported transition metals-N-4(M-N-4@G) for ORR based on density functional theory (DFT), verifying rationality of such catalysts with five different transition metals (Pt, Fe, Co, Pd and Ni) embedded in the graphene, and demonstrating that Fe-N-4@G has better ORR performance than Pt-N-4@G. Moreover, a proposed mechanism of ORR (generating free *O and *OH) is explored to optimize ORR by means of transition-state search in the DFT calculation. Additionally, a novel phenomenon is observed that graphene has a strong attraction to hydrogen atoms, which is facilitated to promote hydrogen evolution reaction of graphene supported catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000783323800001

The development of low-cost, highly efficient and long-term durable electrocatalysts is still challenging for practical large-scale water splitting applications. Herein, a highly crystallized Co-doped FeNi carbonate hydroxide nanosheet array was strongly grown on a conductive nickel foam (Co-FeNi CH/NF) and was used as an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst. The ternary Co-FeNi CH/NF electrode exhibited an improved OER activity and good durability for at least 20 hours. The electrode delivered current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) at extremely low overpotentials of 202 and 254 mV along with a small Tafel slope of 37.5 mV dec(-1) in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. The incorporation of an equivalent amount of cobalt into the trigonal FeNi CH crystal lattice significantly increased the electrochemical active surface area and reduced the electron transport resistance by effectively regulating the electronic structure of the resultant electrocatalyst. These interesting observations highlight the importance of the subtle combinations of the active earth-abundant metals with electronic structure modulations.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000470756000004	31134247

Recently Zn-air batteries have aroused significant research attention, however, because an unresolved impediment due to the notorious instability of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics of the cathode catalyst limit their practical application. Herein, we report the synthesis of non-precious MnCo2O4 nanospheres synergized with a graphene sheet as a bi-functional cathode catalyst for rechargeable Zn-air battery application using a one-pot probe sonochemical method. Structural characterization confirms that the MnCo2O4 nanospheres successfully anchored on graphene sheet. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the Mn and Co in the MnCo2O4 are in mixed valence states on the graphene sheet surface and the MnCo2O4-graphene sheet (MCO-GS) hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent OER and ORR activity compared with their individual counterparts. A rechargeable Zn-air battery using an MCO-GS catalyst reveals unique small charge-discharge overpotential, cycling stability and higher rate capability than a bare MnCo2O4 (MCO) catalyst. This superiority in electrocatalytic activity combined with simplicity of material synthesis, turn the MCO-GS hybrid into a promising catalyst for a rechargeable Zn-air battery.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2516-0230			WOS:000472766100029	36131983

Herein, a fundamental investigation of unfolding intrinsically superior edge-ND trapped atomic Fe motifs (e-ND-Fe) relative to an intact center model (c-ND-Fe) in ORR electrocatalysis is reported. Density functional theory calculations reveal that local electronic redistribution and bandgap shrinkage for e-ND-Fe endow it with a lower free-energy barrier toward direct four-electron ORR. Inspired by this, a series of atomic Fe catalysts with adjustable ND-Fe coordination are synthesized, which verify that ORR performance highly depends on the concentration of e-ND-Fe species. Remarkably, the best e-ND-Fe catalyst delivers a favorable kinetic current density and halfwave potential that can be comparable to benchmark Pt-C under acidic conditions. This work will guide to develop highly active atomic metal catalysts through rational defect engineering.									132	11	0	0	4	0	134			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000529881300037	32134518

Herein, N-doped carbon nanospheres (N-MCN) with plentiful pyridinic and graphitized N-induced active sites were closely bridged with carbon nanotubes to remedy the conductivity loss of N-doping. The as-obtained N-MCN@CNT exhibited hierarchically porous structure with large surfaces area and good conductivity with small charge transfer resistance, which therefore had a superior ORR activity to the other carbon-base catalysts. Importantly, the metal species (M = Fe or Co) can be loaded in this porous N-MCN@CNT via a simple co-pyrolysis, where their numbers and shapes can be easily regulated. It was found the optimal adsorption of metal ions into the precursors produced both single atom and few carbon-coated nanoparticles in M/N-MCN@CNT, which thus synergistically contributed the enhanced ORR performances, including large current density, low onset and half-wave potentials, as well as superior stability and methanol tolerance than those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. Moreover, M/N-MCN@CNT also demonstrated comparable oxygen evolution reaction activity to RuO2 possibly due to the regulated metal species. This work provided a strategy to regulate the nanostructure and intrinsic active sites of carbon-based electmcatalysts.									11	1	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664133400003

Aldehyde reduction, except on Au and Hg, occurs as the heterogeneous catalytic reaction with adsorbed H-adatoms and appears competitive with hydrogen evolution, and while being for about two order of magnitude faster than H-adatom recombination, at lower current densities (about 10 mA cm(-2)) yields rather high current efficiencies (above 90%). Oxygen evolution proceeds along with aldehyde oxidation and only at rather high positive potentials prevails in both surface oxide formation and thereby reduced rate in carboxylic acid production. At extremely positive anodic potentials on Au electrode, there appears a distinct peak of carboxylic group oxidation with release of CO2, preceding oxygen evolution, or occurring along with the latter.

Here we report that at saturating light intensities, carbon dioxide reduction is stable under anaerobiosis but unstable in air. At lower light intensities, carbon dioxide reduction is stable in both atmospheres. The data indicate that OS I is not necessary for autotrophic photosynthesis. One interpretation of these results is that oxygenic photosynthesis developed as a single-light-reaction process, presumably from a bacterium with a phaeophytin-quinone reaction centre, but became unstable as oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere accumulated. PS I was the seconde light reaction, added to confer stability in oxygen-containing atmospheres. Viewed from this perspective, the well-known Z scheme of modern photosynthesis is seen as a specialized adaptation for performing low-potential reductive photochemistry in oxygen-containing atmospheres, but is not an irreducible necessity for satisfying the thermodynamic and mechanistic requirements of carbon dioxide photoreduction using water as the source of reductant.									57	2	0	0	25	0	60			0028-0836			WOS:A1995RM63900056

However, most of the works are focused on oxygen evolution reaction. There are very limited numbers of reports on MOFs for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and generally these reported MOFs suffer from unsatisfactory HER activities. In this contribution, novel 2D Co-BDC/MoS2 (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, C8H4O4) hybrid nanosheets are synthesized via a facile sonication-assisted solution strategy. The introduction of Co-BDC induces a partial phase transfer from semiconducting 2H-MoS2 to metallic 1T-MoS2. Compared with 2H-MoS2, 1T-MoS2 can activate the inert basal plane to provide more catalytic active sites, which contributes significantly to improving HER activity. The well-designed Co-BDC/MoS2 interface is vital for alkaline HER, as Co-BDC makes it possible to speed up the sluggish water dissociation (rate-limiting step for alkaline HER), and modified MoS2 is favorable for the subsequent hydrogen generation step. As expected, the resultant 2D Co-BDC/MoS2 hybrid nanosheets demonstrate remarkable catalytic activity and good stability toward alkaline HER, outperforming those of bare Co-BDC, MoS2, and almost all the previously reported MOF-based electrocatalysts.									125	9	0	0	5	0	126			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000467415700010	30829004

However, the operating voltage of aqueous supercapacitor is usually limited by the electrochemical stability of water, which greatly hinders their application and development. Such a limitation may be surpassed by increasing the over-potential of oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, metal cation inserted MnO2 nanosheets supported on carbon cloth substrate were prepared via electrochemical activation, which can stably work as cathode in an expended positive potential window of 0-1.3 V (vs SCE). To complement this wide potential positive electrode, K+ was adsorbed onto an activated carbon cloth via electrochemical reduction method. As anode, K+ adsorbed activated carbon cloth displayed extended negative potential window of -1.2-0 V (vs SCE) due to the adsorption of K+ effectively prevented the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Photocatalytic activities for the O2 evolution of Cr/Sb and Rh/Sb-codoped TiO2 are strongly dependent on the codoping ratio and the amount of doped chromium and rhodium. The codopant controls the oxidation number of doped chromium and rhodium. Rh-doped SrTiO3 in which the doped Rh species possesses a reversible redox property is active for the H2 evolution reaction under visible light irradiation. Overall water splitting under visible light irradiation proceeds with Z-scheme photocatalyst systems consisting of the Rh-doped SrTiO3 as a H2 evolution photocatalyst combined with BiVO4 as an O2 evolution photocatalyst and an Fe3+/Fe3+ electron mediator.									13	0	0	0	0	0	12			1012-0394			INSPEC:11884138

The results of voltammetries showed that with both anodes, in the potential region before oxygen evolution, the oxidation of NB involves simple electrode transfer, while a very different behavior was observed in the region of water decomposition. At the polarization curves, it was observed that Ti/Pt has lower activity due to lower production of hydroxyl radicals that destroy NB dye in solution, because it has a low overpotential for oxygen evolution and this secondary reaction is favored over mineralization. Conversely, Ti/Pt-SbSn showed significant electrocatalytic activity to oxidize NB. The results of bulk electrolysis showed that the use of SFC or DFC influences the elimination efficiency of color and dissolved organic matter. In the case of DFCTi/Pt+Ti/Pt-SbSn, after 5 h of electrolysis by applying 30 and 60 mA cm(-2) at each one of the electrodes, complete color removal and ae60 % of chemical oxygen demand (COD) elimination were obtained with lower energy consumption requirements when compared with the single electrochemical systems, SFCTi/Pt and SFCTi/Pt-SbSn.					20th Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)20th Brazilian Symposium of Electrochemistry and Electroanalysis (SIBEE)	AUG, 2015AUG, 2015		Uberlandia, BRAZILUberlandia, BRAZIL	9	0	0	0	2	1	9			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000382130000026

It is believed that the outstanding activity of the nanocomposites is due to the synergetic effect between the oxides and carbon. However, the mechanism of this synergetic effect is not clear. In this work, with the help of sophisticated first-principle simulation, it is revealed that Co-O-C bond plays a critical role in improving the OER activity by introducing an extra reaction step in deprotonation of HO*. Furthermore, it is predicted from the simulation that the effective active sites of the nanocomposites are O atoms near the Co-O-C bonds. On the basis of the simulation results, Co3O4/reduced graphene oxide nanocomposites for OER catalysts was designed, with the purpose of optimizing the percentage of Co-O-C bonds and the neighboring active oxygen sites. The formation and the percentage of Co-O-C bonds were characterized using XANES. By changing the precursor amount, the percentage of Co-O-C bonds could be optimized at similar to 43%. The resultant nanocomposites demonstrated outstanding OER activity, which was consistent with the simulation results. Through this work, the mechanism of the synergetic effect between transition metal oxides and carbon for OER activity was proposed.									103	5	0	0	10	0	104			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000397314200049

Herein, a surface phosphorization-monolithic strategy is proposed to embed CoO nanoparticles into paulownia carbon plate (P-CoO@PWC) as monolithic electrodes. Benefiting from the retention of natural transport channels, P-CoO@PWC-2 is conducive to the construction of three-phase interface structure for efficient mass transfer and high electrical conductivity. The electrode exhibits remarkable catalytic activities for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small overpotential gap (E-OER - E-ORR = 0.68 V). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporation of P on P-CoO@PWC-2 surface adjusts the electronic structure to promote the dissociation of water and the activation of oxygen, thus inducing catalytic activity. The monolithic P-CoO@PWC-2 electrode for quasi-solid-state or aqueous ZABs has excellent specific power, low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.83 V), and long-term cycling stability (over 700 cycles). This work serves as a new avenue for transforming abundant biomass into high-value energy-related engineering products.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17				2198-3844		WOS:000682878500001	34369108

To investigate product inhibition at elevated oxygen partial pressure (pO(2) ranging from 0.2 to 16 bar), we monitored specifically the redox reactions of the Mn complex in its catalytic S-state cycle by rapid-scan and time-resolved X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) at the Mn K-edge. By using a pressure cell for X-ray measurements after laser-flash excitation of PSII particles, we found a clear pO(2) influence on the redox reactions of the Mn complex, with a similar half-effect pressure as determined (2-3 bar). However, XANES spectra and the time courses of the X-ray fluorescence collected with microsecond resolution suggested that the O-2 evolution transition itself (S-3 double right arrow S-0+O-2) was not affected. Additional (nonstandard) oxidation of the Mn complex at high pO(2) explains our experimental findings more readily. Our results suggest that photosynthesis at ambient conditions is not limited by product inhibition of the O-2 formation step.									45	0	0	0	26	0	45			0027-8424			WOS:000260981800041	18987324

Herein, we develop a facile strategy to realize in-situ assembly of CoOOH nanosheets into the PANI network, which is denoted as Co/PANI HNSs for OER performance. The nitrogen species derived from PANI building blocks can work as bridging sites to preferentially coordinate with Co metal ions, which impart coupling effects between CoOOH nanosheets and PANI as well as the structure stability. Besides the Co-N coordination, the occurred electron delocalization between Co d-orbitals and PANI pi-conjugated ligands can also modulate the electronic structural states of Co/PANI HNSs, enabling the efficient interfacial electron transfer from CoOOH to PANI. In addition, the Co/PANI HNSs possesses a hierarchical porous with both structure of mesopores and macropores that allows electrolyte to be more efficiently transported to the highly oxidative active sites, resulting in fast reaction kinetics. In recognition of these advanced structural characteristics, the Co/PANI HNSs electrocatalyst can give a low overpotential of 291 mV at an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte as well as a good durability.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000562943800002

Theophylline (THP) can be easily extracted from natural plants, whose nitrogen atoms can chelate with metal ions. With assistance of THP, FeCo alloy was confined in N-doped carbon nanotubes (FeCo/NCNTs-800) by one-step pyrolysis of a mixture of the metal precursors, g-C3N4 and THP. The resulting FeCo/NCNTs-800 showed a better ORR performance (onset potential, E-onset = 1.09 V; half-wave potential, E-1/2 = 0.87 V) than commercial Pt/C (50 wt%) in a 0.1 M KOH solution, with a limiting current density as high as -5.54 mA cm(-2).

One particular drawback of conventional water splitting is that the hydrogen-forming reduction reaction is tightly coupled, both spatially and temporally, to the oxygen-forming oxidation reaction. This coupling poses challenges in both conventional and direct-solar-powered electrolysis systems, including gas crossover and separator degradation, sometimes necessitating the use of precious metal catalysts. In decoupled water splitting, the conventional electrolysis reactions are separated spatially, temporally, or both, via coupling to an intermediate redox mediator. Decoupled water-splitting systems are flexible and modular by nature, with other proposed benefits including facile coupling to renewable power sources, utilization of earth-abundant catalysts, and intrinsically safe operation. Here we review recent advances in decoupled water splitting and related fields, mainly categorizing decoupled systems by mediator phase and standard potential. We offer insight to how decoupling may be advantageous, and which tradeoffs need to be considered for practical implementation. We conclude our review with discussion of known technological hurdles and note opportunities for future discovery.									46	2	0	0	2	0	46			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000680468300001

Part I: Reactions with Gaseous Products								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY				33	6			911	920		10.1002/ceat.200900624				JUN 2010	2010	For heterogeneously catalyzed multiphase reactions the formation of bubbles may have an influence on mass and heat transfer as well as on the effective reaction rate. This first of two contributions deals with the Ni-catalyzed decomposition of H2O2, which was used as a model system for an (almost) isothermal reaction with a gaseous product. (In part lithe strongly exothermic hydrogenation of hexene will be analyzed, where gas/vapor bubbles may be generated by overheating of the catalyst.) The discharge of O-2 bubbles formed by decomposition of H2O2 enhances the external mass and heat transfer up to one order of magnitude. This is in analogy to the well-known phenomena during nucleate boiling. The experiments and theoretical considerations also show that the internal mass transfer depends on the intensity of the reaction and thus on the H2O2 concentration, which is in contradiction to the classical Thiele approach. This discrepancy could be explained by a modified model that takes the formation of bubbles into account.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0930-7516	1521-4125		WOS:000279093600006

Herein, we report a novel bimetallic-ion co-exchange combined pyrolysis strategy using bioMOF-1 as the self-template to synthesize NiCo nanoalloy-Co-N-4 embedded hierarchical porous carbon (CoNiCoN4-HPC-900), which endows good electrical conductivity, large surface area and rich highly-dispersed CoNiCoN4 active sites identified from X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resulting in outstanding electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER in alkaline solution. In situ Raman spectroscopy testifys that the electrocatalytic processes occur via the redox of Co(Ni)(II and III) species. Density functional theory calculations are performed to study the ORR and OER activity on the CoNi-CoN4 and CoN4 active sites. The CoNi-CoN4-HPC-900 endows a flexible rechargeable Zn-air battery with an open circuit voltage of 1.50 V and a peak power density of 116 mW cm(-2), and excellent flexibility and cycling stability as a cathode. This bimetallic-ion-coexchange strategy of MOFs gives an effective methodology involving bimetallic-ion-coexchange strategy to design and prepare bifunctional electroctalysts in metal-air batteries but also brings an intensive insight into ORR and OER fundamentals.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000807347900001

Herein, a feasible strategy is presented to manipulate oxygen vacancies and interfacial boundaries on hierarchical tin oxide aggregates via a thermal reduction process. The optimized Sn/SnO2-2h electrocatalyst exhibited the maximum faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of 92.5 and 96.4% for C1 products (FEC1) in the H-type cell and the flow cell, respectively. Online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry confirmed the lower onset potential for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR) in comparison with the pristine SnO2. With the defect evolution from oxygen vacancies (O-vacs), the formation of Sn/SnO2 with favorable interfacial features is crucial to achieve an enhanced performance. More importantly, the in situ characterization studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the synergistic effect of both residual O-vacs and the interfacial structure is responsible for the energy favorable reduction of carbon dioxide via proton-coupled electron transfer, thus improving the selectivity for formate generation. This facile strategy for modulating surface defects provides an ideal approach to guide the future designs of ECRR catalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000664470800001

Microbial genome evolution is not a treelike process because of lateral gene transfer and the endosymbiotic origins of organelles.

Here we present monolithic hybrid electrodes of chromium-doped NiFe oxyhydroxide nanosheets, which are quasi-vertically oriented along three-dimensional nanoporous gold (NP Au/Cr-NiFe), as high-performance OER electrocatalysts in an alkaline environment. As a result of incorporation of chromium ions that prefer to locate near the electroactive Fe sites in the NiFe oxyhydroxides, the intrinsic activity and turnover frequency value of the constituent Cr-NiFe oxyhydroxide are significantly enhanced relative to those of the NiFe hydroxide by a factor of approximate to 4 at an overpotential of 0.340 V. As a result of the unique nanoarchitecture featuring both the quasi-vertical orientation of highly electroactive Cr-NiFe oxyhydroxide nanosheets, which offer abundant active edge sites, and the bicontinuous nanoporous channels and gold skeleton, which facilitate ion and electron transport, the NP Au/Cr-NiFe electrodes exhibit high and stable OER activity in a 0.1 M KOH solution, with an ultralow Tafel slope of approximate to 33 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 0.323 V at 10 mA cm(geo)(-2).									21	2	0	0	2	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000467249200027

While the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e(-) ORR) toward H2O2 has been covered extensively in the literature, the unorthodox two-electron water oxidation reaction (2e(-) WOR) remains far less popular, due to the thermodynamic unfavorability of the pathway. Nonetheless, the 2e(-) WOR constitutes a coveted procedure as it enables the electro-generation of H2O2 solely from water. A thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism, including all intermediates and competing reaction routes, is essential for the fabrication of electrocatalysts, and assembly of electrochemical reactors, capable of greater H2O2 production rates with an optimal efficiency. This review focuses exclusively on the 2e(-) WOR to electrochemically produce H2O2. A summary of all prevailing water oxidation mechanisms is presented, supported with computational and experimental data, and key challenges and limitations that require attention are addressed.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000610827900004

A promising pathway for dispersing this precious catalyst is on an electric conductive and stable support. However, there is a lack of understanding how the support-catalyst interactions affect the stability/activity of the electrocatalyst under anodic conditions. This work discloses a modified, easy-scalable, polyol synthesis protocol to produce a highly active and stable iridium-based catalyst, supported on metal-doped tin oxides. The loading of Ir was reduced 30 wt.% compared to the reference IrO2, and dispersed on Sb-SnO2 (IrOx/ATO), In-SnO2 (IrOx/ITO) and SnO2 supports. All synthesized electrocatalysts not only surpassed the OER-mass activity of a commercial catalyst (IrO2) - reference - but also reached higher electrochemical active surface areas and enhanced stability under the OER conditions. The highest performance was achieved with Ir NPs supported on ITO (176 A/gIr vs. 15.5 A/gIr for the reference catalyst @ 1.51 V vs. RHE) and both IrOx/ITO and IrOx/SnO2 catalysts demonstrated remarkable stability after cycling the electrode and performing long-term chronopotentiometry. ITO is, therefore, an auspicious support to serve Ir-based catalysts as it favors a good bargain between activity and stability, while drastically reducing the amount of noble metal.

The model deals with the gas and solid phases of the flow. For the coal particles a Lagrangian description is used, taking into account the simultaneous processes of moisture evaporation and devolatilization together with the heterogeneous gasification reactions of the char.An Eulerian description will be used for the distributions of temperature and concentrations in the gas phase, with the effect of the particles represented by volumetric sources of heat, mass and momentum. The gas phase oxidation reactions of the volatiles, H-2 and CO will be modelled using the assumption of infinitely fast rates; the Burke-Schumann analysis will be generalized to account for the competition for oxygen of CO, H-2 and the volatiles. These reactions may occur, in the form of group combustion, in a gaseous thin diffusion flame separating a region without oxygen, where the coal particles generate volatiles, H-2 and CO, from a region with oxygen, where the reactions may occur inside the particles or, outside, in diffusion flames surrounding the individual particles, even though for small particle sizes the gas phase reactions can be considered as frozen near the particles. The analysis will provide relations for the volumetric sources appearing in the gas phase description, and for the rates that determine the evolution of the temperature and mass content of moisture, volatiles and char in the particles.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1364-7830			WOS:000252851300005

Herein, we synthesize a Ni3Fe/FeV2O4 heterojunction catalyst with a carbon-encapsulated mesoporous nanosheet structure self-supported on nickel foam (NF) by hydrothermal and annealing processes. The obtained catalyst inherits the merits of Ni3Fe and FeV2O4, and the heterostructure can efficiently enhance the catalytic activity. Besides, the carbon layer combined with mesoporous nanosheets could provide more active sites to improve the performance. Low overpotentials (220/350 and 44/366 mV at +/- 10/+/- 1500 mA cm(-2)) are required for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For OWS, a potential of 1.51 V is required to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and is maintained at 1500 mA cm(-2) for 100 h in 6.0 M KOH at 60 degrees C. This work thus introduces a valuable and durable catalyst for OWS at large current density.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000664614900025

Herein, we use a plasmonic heterojunction of Au nanoparticle (NP)-decorated C3N4 with nitrogen vacancies (Au/NV-C3N4) as a bifunctional catalyst to promote oxygen cathode reactions of the visible light-responsive Li-O-2 battery. The nitrogen vacancies on NV-C3N4 can adsorb and activate O-2 molecules, which are subsequently converted to Li2O2 as the discharge product by photogenerated hot electrons from plasmonic Au NPs. While charging, the holes on Au NPs drive the reverse decomposition of Li2O2 with a reduced applied voltage. The discharge voltage of the Li-O-2 battery with Au/NV-C3N4 is significantly raised to 3.16 V under illumination, exceeding its equilibrium voltage, and the decreased charge voltage of 3.26 V has good rate capability and cycle stability. This is ascribed to the plasmonic hot electrons on Au NPs pumped from the conduction bands of NV-C3N4 and the prolonged carrier life span of Au/NV-C3N4. This work highlights the vital role of plasmonic enhancement and sheds light on the design of semiconductors for visible light-mediated Li-O-2 batteries and beyond.									27	0	0	0	2	0	27			0027-8424			WOS:000672579000004	33879619

In particular, MOxHy are the fastest known catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. While key descriptors such as overpotentials and activity have been thoroughly characterized, the nanostructure and its dynamics under electrochemical conditions are not yet fully understood. Here, we report on the structural evolution of Ni1-delta Co delta OxHy nanosheets with varying ratios of Ni to Co, in operando using atomic force microscopy during electrochemical cycling. We found that the addition of Co to NiOxHy nanosheets results in a higher porosity of the as synthesized nanosheets, apparently reducing mechanical stress associated with redox cycling and hence enhancing stability under electrochemical conditions. As opposed to nanosheets composed of pure NiOxHy, which dramatically reorganize under electro-chemical conditions to form nanoparticle assemblies, restructuring is not found for Ni1-delta Co delta OxHy with a high Co content. Ni0.8Fe0.2OxHy nanosheets show high roughness as synthesized which increases during electrochemical cycling while the integrity of the nanosheet shape is maintained. These findings enhance the fundamental understanding of MOxHy materials and provide insight into how nanostructure and composition affect structural dynamics at the nanoscale.									38	2	0	0	1	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459221900003	29708339

The cyclic voltammetry showed a pair of redox peaks prior to the onset of oxygen evolution; regardless of the nature of the substitution. The presence of Fe or Ni, in small quantities, enhanced the electrochemically active area. The anodic polarization studies indicated two Tafel slopes: similar to 2.3 RT/F at low and similar to 2(2.3 RT/F) at high overpotentials. The oxygen evolution reaction on each B-site substituted perovskite followed first-order kinetics with respect to OH- ion concentration. The La0.8Sr0.2Co0.9Fe0.1O3 and La0.8Sr0.2Co0.9Ni0.1O3 electrodes showed the highest electrocatalytic activity based on geometrical surface area.

Recently, the application of these thin film materials to catalytic systems has begun to attract much attention, and the capacity to deposit these catalytic films in a highly controlled manner continues to gain importance. In this study, IrO2 and NiO thin films (approximately 25 to 60 nm) were deposited on industrial Ni expanded mesh as an anode for alkaline water electrolysis. Different ALD operating parameters such as the total number of deposition cycles, sublimation and deposition temperatures, and precursors pulse and purge lengths were varied to determine their effects on the structure and the electrochemical performance of the thin film materials. Results from the electrochemical tests (6 M KOH, 80 degrees C, up to 10 kA/m(2)) showed the catalytic activity of the samples. Oxygen overpotential values (eta O-2) were 20 to 60 mV lower than the bare Ni expanded mesh. In summary, the study has demonstrated the feasibility of using the ALD technique to deposit uniformed and electroactive thin films on industrial metallic substrates as anodes for alkaline water electrolysis.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				2073-4344		WOS:000516825000092

Here, an excellent photoanode of black BiVO4@amorphous TiO2-x to tackle both problems is reported. Its applied bias photon-to-current efficiency for solar water splitting is up to 2.5%, which is a new record for a single oxide photon absorber. This unique core-shell structure is fabricated by coating amorphous TiO2 on nanoporous BiVO4 with the aid of atomic layer deposition and further hydrogen plasma treatment at room temperature. The black BiVO4 with moderate oxygen vacancies reveals a bandgap reduction of approximate to 0.3 eV and significantly enhances solar utilization, charge transport and separation simultaneously, compared with conventional BiVO4. The amorphous layer of TiO2-x acts as both oxygen-evolution catalyst and protection layer, which suppresses anodic photocorrosion to stabilize black BiVO4. This configuration of black BiVO4@amorphous TiO2-x may provide an effective strategy to prompt solar water splitting toward practical applications.									96	1	0	0	5	0	96			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477779600011

The morphology and structure of 3D-PbO2 electrodes were investigated by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Compared with the traditional PbO2 electrodes (Flat-PbO2), 3D-PbO2 electrodes possess the three-dimensional porous structure and finer grain size. The electrochemical properties of 3D-PbO2 electrodes were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS). The 3D-PbO2 electrodes show larger electrochemical active surface area, lower charge transfer resistance and higher oxygen evolution overpotential than Flat-PbO2 electrodes. In the electrocatalytic degradation process ofmalachite green, the degradation rate constant of 3D-PbO2 electrodes (0.05189 min(-1)) was 5.8 times than that of Flat-PbO2 electrodes (0.00889 min(-1)).

In standby 'float' operation, there appears be some difficulty in uniformly charging a VRLA battery string. This may be due to oxygen recombination promoting a depolarized negative that continues to self-discharge. While use of catalysts for VRLA cells has been explored for quite some time, realization that there is a lack of stoichiometry in oxygen and hydrogen evolution did not promote focused investigation in this direction. However, recent data shows that inserting a catalyst in the headspace changes the dynamics of the oxygen recombination reaction - recombination is suppressed at the negative plate and diverted to the surface of the catalyst. This changed dynamics overcomes the problem of negative self-discharge and ensures effective recharge of VRLA battery strings on float. This paper reviews the experimental work from C&D, which culminated in the commercialization of catalyst-equipped VRLA cells in long-life products. A laboratory device for investigating the quality of catalysts is also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Herein, recent computational studies by density functional theory (DFT) applied for simulations of MOF structure and complex architecture determination, prediction of properties, and computational characterization, including large-scale screening and geometrical properties of hypothetical MOFs, diffusion and adsorption processes in MOFs, are reviewed. DFT calculations have been applied in the MOF area to study chemical stability; mechanical, photophysical, optical, and magnetic properties; photoluminescence; porosity; and semiconductor or metallic character. The prediction of MOF analogs with open-metal sites, studies of chemical bonding and the prediction of energies by quantum mechanics allows reducing experimental efforts in the creation of MOF/polymer membranes, adsorbents for CO2 uptake, separation of C2H2/CH4, C2H2/CO2, and inert gases, radionuclides sequestration, and water adsorption, as well as other promising advances. For the MOF-derived carbons, a lack of profound DFT investigations is currently observed, being mainly restricted to the electrocatalysis area (nitrogen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction), resulting applications in batteries and other storage devices, CO2 sequestration, and absorbance of organic substances.									13	0	0	0	3	0	13			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000540764300008

The lanthanum inhibited the whole electron chain-transport activity of chloroplast. DCIP photoreduction and oxygen evolution activities of the photosystem I (PSII) also decrease after treatment with La3+. But the diminished activities of PSII and chloroplast caused by La3+ could be reversed by Ca2+ and even became higher than the control level. The concentration analysis of related protein complexes to photoelectron transport in chloroplast included that La3+ induced the concentration of chlorophyll protein complexes increasing but caused some nonchlorophyll protein complexes to decompose partially. This increasing effect of La3+ on chlorophyll protein complexes results in the improvement of chlorophyll content, which will improve the absorption of photoelectron and energy transport in the process of photosynthesis.									17	3	0	0	11	0	20			0163-4984			WOS:000165101700008	11097473

The fabrication of a novel and efficient non-metallic co-catalyst is increasingly essential for the improvement of photocatalytic oxygen production. Herein, a novel ternary composite based photo catalyst with high oxygen evolution activity was synthesized and fully characterized. The composite introduced here consists of CNTs and MoSe2 as a new cocatalyst in order to accelerate the activity of Ag3PO4 photocatalysis. The optimal oxygen generation rate of 102.3 mu mol L-1 g(-1) h(-1) for the ternary Ag3PO4/CNTs@MoSe2 photo catalyst was achieved under the visible-light irradiation, which is higher than pure Ag3PO4 (2.88 times), Ag3PO4/CNTs (1.91 times) and Ag3PO4/MoSe2 (1.31 times) samples. The superior oxygen evolution is mainly attributed to CNTs@MoSe2 as binary co-catalysts which can bing about the effective separation and transportation of the photoexcited charge carriers and good electrical conductivity. The present work will set the foundations of designing high-performance Ag3PO4-based photocatalysts for energy and environmental applications.					3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP)3rd International Workshop on Graphene and C3N4-Based Photocatalysts (IWGCP)	MAR 23-26, 2019MAR 23-26, 2019		Wuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan Univ Technol, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000510846500139

Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are a typical group of catalysts that have been previously applied for hydrogen-evolution and hydrodesulfurization reactions. Using density-functional-theory calculations, we explore the prospect of both traditional and Janus TMDs as electrochemical ORR catalysts by studying their planar surfaces and different kinds of edges. Among the tens of surfaces, armchair edges, and zigzag edges of Mo- and W-based systems screened here, we find that both excellent stability and high catalytic activity can be simultaneously achieved for the zigzag edges of WSe2 and WSSe. The overpotentials of different zigzag edges of WSe2 and WSSe vary between 0.43 and 0.64 V, as low as that of the prototypical Pt electrode (similar to 0.45 V). The comprehensive ORR activities of TMD-based surfaces and edges studied here, as well as the high ORR activity discovered for specific zigzag edges, can not only be readily validated by experiments but also facilitate their future related applications by providing a complete structure-property relationship. Those low overpotentials are benefited from the moderate OH-edge bonding strength, and the revealed microscopic electornic-structure mechanisms here will also be useful for further optimizing the ORR activities of TMD edges through, e.g., chemical, mechanical, and potentiostatic approaches.

Several representative elements, e.g., Co, Fe and P, have been utilized as cation or anion to promote the electrocatalytic activity of NiSe2 by modulating the interaction with Se element, whilst the catalyst stability is less concerned. In this work, the catalytic Ni nanoparticles were in-situ encapsulated in carbon nanotubes grown on three-dimensional conducting carbon framework. Subsequent phosphorization and selenization yield dispersed P-doped NiSe2 nanoparticles protected by carbon shell with highly exposed yet stable active sides, resulting in significantly promoted HER and OER activities as well as accelerated kinetics. In detail, the P-NiSe2@N-CNTs/NC hybrid catalyst deliver low overpotentials of 95 and 306 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively. DFT calculations reveal that P doping reduces the electron density surrounding Ni atoms while accumulates the charges to Se, respectively, which in turn reduces the energy barriers for both water dissociation and intermediates adsorption for both HER and OER. As a concept of proof, a cell assembled by P-NiSe2@N-CNTs/NC hybrid catalyst-based anode and cathode performs a low applied voltage of 1.609 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2), and outstanding long-term stability.

Recalling ideas from nuclear structure on Kaon condensate and a soft equation of state of the dense nuclear matter they concluded that progenitor stars with mass as low as 17-18M(circle dot) (including supernova 1987A) could collapse to a small mass black hole with a mass just beyond 1.5M(circle dot), the upper bound they derive for a neutron star. We discuss another nuclear structure effect that determines the carbon to oxygen ratio (C/O) at the end of helium burning. This ratio also determines the fate of a Type II supernova with a carbon rich progenitor star producing a neutron star and oxygen rich collapsing to a black hole. While the C/O ratio is one of the most important nuclear inputs to stellar evolution it is still not known with sufficient accuracy. We discuss future efforts to measure with gamma-beam and TPC detector of the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction that determines the C/O ratio in stellar helium burning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We report a facile method to synthesize heterostructure carbon consisting of graphitic and amorphous carbon derived from the agricultural waste of red bean pods. The heterostructure carbon possesses a large surface area of 625.5 m(2) g(-1), showing ORR onset potential of 0.89 V vs. RHE and OER overpotential of 470 mV at 5 mA cm(-2). Introducing hollow FeCo nanoparticles and nitrogen dopant improves the bifunctional catalytic activity of the carbon, delivering ORR onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and OER overpotential of 360 mV. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) O K-edge map suggests the presence of localized oxygen on the FeCo nanoparticles, suggesting the oxidation of the nanoparticles.

It is highly challenging but desirable to develop efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A universal and facile method for the development of bifunctional electrocatalysts with outstanding electrocatalytic activity for both the ORR and OER in alkaline medium is reported. A mixture of Pt/C catalyst with superior ORR activity and a perovskite oxide based catalyst with outstanding OER activity was employed in appropriate ratios, and prepared by simple ultrasonic mixing. Nanosized platinum particles with a wide range of platinum to oxide mass ratios was realized easily in this way. The as-formed Pt/C-oxide composites showed better ORR activity than a single Pt/C catalyst and better OER activity than a single oxide to bring about much improved bifunctionality (DE is only approximate to 0.8 V for Pt/C-BSCF; BSCF = Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta), due to the synergistic effect. The electronic transfer mechanism and the rate-determining step and spillover mechanism were two possible origins of such a synergistic effect. Additionally, the phenomenon was found to be universal, although the best performance could be reached at different platinum to oxide mass ratios for different oxide catalysts. This work thus provides an innovative strategy for the development of new bifunctional electrocatalysts with wide application potentials in high-energy and efficient electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									81	3	0	0	6	0	83			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000345234800034	25267542

Here, we report the enhancement of photocatalytic activity by the flow of hot electrons on TiO2 nanotube arrays decorated with 5-30 nm Au nanoparticles as photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. This enhanced photocatalytic activity is correlated to the size of the Au nanoparticles, where higher oxygen evolution was observed on the smaller nanoparticles. Conductive atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the Schottky barrier between Au and TiO2, which reveals a reduction in the Schottky barrier with the smaller Au nanoparticles and produces an enhanced transfer of photoinduced hot carriers. This study confirms that the higher photocatalytic activity was indeed driven by the hot electron flux generated from the decay of localized surface plasmon resonance.									63	1	0	0	1	0	63			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000452490800008	30484456

This study reveals that the mechanism of Ni2+/PbO2 electrodeposition is not in conflict with that of PbO2 formation in the absence of foreign species that we described earlier. Accordingly, electrochemical formation of PbO2 occurs in four stages, two of which are electron transfer steps while the other two are chemical reactions involving formation and decay of soluble intermediates Consisting of 3 and 4-valent lead species. We observed an inhibition of Pb2+ electrooxidation in the presence of Ni2+ that is attributable to partial blocking of the active surface sites by the adsorbed foreign cations. Interestingly though, blocked active sites that inhibit the growth of PbO2 show, at the same time, a high activity for O-2 evolution. Changing of the electrolyte composition and conditions of electrodeposition of PbO2 (deposition potential, temperature and pH) significantly influences the physicochemical properties of the PbO2 deposits. In particular, the phase and chemical composition, the crystallographic orientation, the content of structural water and the nature of adsorbed oxygen-containing,particles on the electrode surface. Concerning the last point, bearing direct relevance to the electrocatalytic properties, we noted that Ni2+/PbO2 electrbdes feature a significant increase in the amount of labile oxygen intermediates on the electrode surface which are responsible of a high electrocatalytic activity in the O-2 evolution reaction.

Oxide complexes, formed in oxygen (2.67 Pa) at 973 or 1073 K,were exposed to 2.67 Pa of the bath gas in the temperature range 923 to 1073 K. Changes in the population of surface complexes were identified through analysis of gas evolution (principally CO) profiles during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of the oxides in an inert atmosphere. Oxides formed in this work display a distribution of activation energies for their decomposition, E-des, from 300 to 420 kJ mol(-1). Soaking of these oxides in Ar showed the frequency factor for their thermal decomposition to be 10(14.3 +/- 0.3) s(-1), independent of E-des. The effect of soaking in CO was essentially the same as that of Ar, and it is concluded that no significant reaction occurs under these conditions between surface oxides and CO. However, on soaking in H-2, H2O was evolved as a result of reaction between hydrogen and the surface oxide complex[GRAPHICS]The kinetics of the reaction between hydrogen and surface complexes are dependent on the reaction temperature and on the thermal stability of the reacting surface oxide. Less stable oxides react more readily than do more stable oxides. If all the reaction rate variation between complexes of differing thermal stability is attributed to changes in the activation energy of the reaction, the activation energy for the reaction of H-2 with complexes may be expressed as E-H = 0.5E(des) - 50 kJ mol(-1), 348 < E-des < 408 kJ mol(-1). Comparison of the apparent preexponential factor for the reaction with the expected frequency factor for gas-surface-complex collision under the experimental conditions suggests that direct reaction of hydrogen with the oxygen complex may be the limiting Step in the overall reaction.

J	Liang, Jianyong; Pochiraju, Kishore V.								Oxidation-induced damage evolution in a unidirectional polymer matrix composite								JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS				49	11			1393	1406		10.1177/0021998314534705				MAY 2015	2015	Long-term degradation and failure in high-temperature polymer matrix composites are driven by chemical changes due to oxidation reactions and damage evolution. In this paper, we present a methodology for simulating oxidation-induced damage in a unidirectional composite. This approach explicitly models the time-dependent growth of oxidation layers and the evolution of discrete cracking in a homogenized representation of the composite. Long-term isothermal aging is simulated with high-resolution tracking of morphological changes and damage evolution. An element-free Galerkin method is used to simulate the oxidation layer growth, and the extended finite element method is used for computing the stress fields and predicting damage. The developed model captures both oxidation and damage growth in the unidirectional lamina through long periods of oxidative aging. The model predictions correlate well with the experimental results for a carbon/polyimide composite system.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-9983	1530-793X		WOS:000353456200010

Through direct surface modification with ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6), phosphorus can be successfully incorporated onto the surface of the carbon felt by forming phosphate functional groups with -OH chemical moieties that exhibit good hydrophilicity. The electrochemical reactivity of the carbon felt toward the redox reactions of VO2+/VO2+ (in the catholyte) and V3+/V2+ (in the anolyte) can be effectively improved owing to the superior catalytic effects of the oxygen-rich phosphate groups. Furthermore, undesirable hydrogen evolution can be suppressed by minimizing the overpotential for the V3+/V2+ redox reaction in the anolyte of the VRFB. Cell-cycling tests with the catalyzed electrodes show improved energy efficiencies of 88.2 and 87.2% in the 1(st) and 20(th)cycles compared with 83.0 and 81.1%, respectively, for the pristine electrodes at a constant current density of 32mAcm(-2). These improvements are mainly attributed to the faster charge transfer allowed by the integration of the oxygen-rich phosphate groups on the carbon-felt electrode.									81	3	0	0	2	0	82			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000378633800014	27106165

The effect of TiO2 substitution by CeO2 on the system surface parameters and oxygen evolution reaction was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and impedance measurements from 1.0 mol dm(-3) KOH. Independent of composition, the solid state redox couple Ir(III)/Ir(IV) dominates the surface properties of the anodes. Increasing the CeO2-content of the materials causes an increase in their active surface area, as supported by the anodic voltammetric charge, q(a), and double layer capacitance, C-dl, values. The small cathodic shift in E-p values observed as a consequence of CeO2 introduction into the material suggests an interaction among the components. R-Omega-values ranging between 1.3 and 2.9 Omega cm(2); independent of composition,are in;excellent agreement with the results of the Tafel investigation (similar to 2.0 Omega cm(2)), The R-ct-values reveal all CeO2-containing compositions have better overall activity than the reference cm composition (Ti/Ir0.3Ti0.7O2) Based on 1/R(ct)q(a) behaviour, however; best site activity was found for electrodes with low CeO2-content (10 and 20 mol%), (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Framelike hollow nanostructures (nanoframes, NFs) provide the open structure with more accessible active sites and sufficient channels into the interior volume. Here, we report the fabrication of bimetallic Co-Fe phosphide NFs (Co-Fe-P NFs) via an intriguing temperature-controlled strategy for the preparation of precursors followed by phosphidation. The precursors, Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues (Co-Fe PBAs) are prepared by a precipitation method with Co2+ and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-), which experience a structural conversion from nanocubes to NFs by increasing the aging temperature from 5 to 35 degrees C. The experimental results indicate that this conversion is attributable to the preferentially epitaxial growth on the edges and corners of nanocubes, triggered by intramolecular electron transfer at an elevated aging temperature. The as-prepared Co-Fe-P NFs catalyst shows remarkable catalytic activity toward OER with a low overpotential of 276 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to the reference samples (Co-Fe-P nanocubes) and most of the recently reported TMPs-based electrocatalysts. The synthetic strategy can be extended to fabricate Co-Fe dichalcogenide NFs, thereby holding a great promise for the broad applications in energy storage and conversion systems.									22	2	0	0	2	0	22			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000686115200001

Meanwhile, V- and Co-based bimetallic oxide materials were rarely reported for overall water splitting in AAEMWE. Herein, we demonstrate that the self-supported oxovanadate-doped cobalt carbonate (VCoCOx@NF) on nickel foam (NF) is a high-performance overall water-splitting catalyst in AAEMWE. The as-prepared VCoCOx@NF catalyst demonstrates high activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in alkaline media, with a current density (j) of 10 mA cm-2 at overpotentials of 63 mV and 240 mV, respectively. Assembled as a conventional electrolyzer for overall water splitting, VCoCOx@NF as both anode and cathode in 1 M KOH operates at low cell voltages of 1.54 and 1.74 V at 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively, superior to the Ir/ C-Pt/C@NF electrolyzer (1.59 and 1.86 V, respectively). First principle calculations show that the remarkable HER and OER at the Co site are due to the doping of V species, which reduces the overpotential by shifting the delectron states of Co towards the Fermi-level. Besides, an AAEMWE cell fabricated with the VCoCOx@NF catalyst delivers j = 200 mA cm-2 at 2.01 V in deionized water, lower than the expensive commercial IrOx-Pt/C@Au/Ti electrolyzer (2.06 V). This finding provides the stage for large-scale hydrogen production by utilizing the V- and Co-based bimetallic oxide materials.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724712700001

In the present study, different morphologies of two rare earth based nanomaterials Gd2O3:GdPO4 and Nd2O3:NdPO4 were successfully made via simple one-step hydrothermal method and used as catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic medium (0.5 M H2SO4). The Nd2O3:NdPO(4 )exhibited comparable catalytic activity with standard Pt/C electrode material in 0.5 M H2SO4. The obtained overpotential to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for Nd2O3:NdPO4 and standard Pt/C was 134 and 123.5 mV vs. RHE, respectively and their corresponding Tafel slopes were 55.6 and 52.5 mV.decade(- 1), respectively.

Meanwhile, the heterostructure can enhance the catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Inspired by the recent preparation of efficient catalysts for HER by using heterogeneous structures of different metal phosphides, we have designed a simple two-step method strategy based on sol-gel/ carbonization to prepare the bimetal phosphide coated by nitrogen and phosphorus codoped ( N,P-codoped) porous carbon. Phytic acid, chitosan and aniline are adopted to form the N,P-codoped porous carbon framework, the ferric chloride (FeCl3) and ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (H8MoN2O4) are used as the metal sources to obtained bimetal phosphides (MoP/FeP). The heterostructural interface between the bimetal phosphides of MoP/FeP enhance the catalytic performance, while the N,P-codoped porous carbon promotes the development of reaction kinetics to accelerate the mass and electron transition. The prepared catalysts display limited overpotentials at high current density and exhibit good stability for long-time test. Density functional theory (DFT) is adopted to investigate the interact between the bimetal phosphides, which proves that the heterostructural interface can reduce the reaction Gibbs free-energy (Delta G(H)*) and benefit the adsorption / desorption of intermediate H*. This work provides a facile route to the design of the metal phosphides for HER.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000742147400006

The formation of pure phase cube-shaped CuWO4 nanoparticles (CWO-NPs) is analyzed by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and field-emission electron microscopy (FE-SEM and FE-TEM). CWO-NPs show remarkable bifunctional electro-catalytic behavior for the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution. Polarization studies of CWO-NPs exhibit low over-potential (similar to 260 mV) at 1 mA/cm(2) and low Tafel slope value (similar to 190 mV/dec) for OER compared to bulk or other oxides. Polarization studies with controlled electrode rotation reveal a four-electron pathway for the water electrolysis reaction for OER/ORR. In addition, CWO-NPs show promising capacitive behavior with specific capacitance values of similar to 230 F/g using 1 M KOH electrolyte. Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) studies of CWO-NPs displays low energy loss during discharge time for 50 segments. To further investigate the potential for industrial applications, the stability of the electrodes is also examined using chrono-amperometry (CA) at fixed potential, chronopotentiometry (CP) at fixed current density, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) with 50 cycles.									38	0	0	0	6	0	38			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300018

However, a single component catalyst usually has only one of the many properties of an ideal electrocatalyst. Herein, for the first time, we synthesize CoxSe/MoSe2 micro-prisms on foam via a hydrothermal and selenization strategy. After selenization, a crystallized CoMoO4 smooth prismatic structure can be converted into a CoxSe/MoSe2 prismatic structure with lamellar morphology. Such synergistic effects lead to CoxSe/MoSe2 superior electrochemical catalytic activity with a 109 mV over-potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and 204 mV over-potential at 100 mA cm(-2), an appropriate Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1), and remarkable long-term stability during 20 h of testing for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an alkaline medium. Density-functional calculations reveal the absorption energy of water and Gibbs free-energy of intermediate adsorb hydrogen of CoxSe/MoSe2 is more favorable for hydrogen evolution reaction than single component catalyst. Both experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that synergistic effect can efficiently reduce energy barrier of both the initial water adsorption step and subsequent H-2 generation on binary catalysts, and improve catalytic activity.

In other hand, the yield of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is dependent on the binding energy of H2O at electrode surface. Therefore, on a specific metal substrate, attenuation of HBs may be a promising route for improving OER. In this study, the computational and experimental evidences indicate that the performance of ultrasonically irradiated deionized water (USI-DW), participated in water oxidation reaction (WOR), is different from its in the intact bulk water. To date, establishing of new electro-catalysts with lower overpotentials (eta) and higher current densities (J) in OER have been mostly considered based on metals and oxide materials. Here, we ultrasonically agitated the water clusters formed by strong HBs, and as a sustainable improvement route explored its particular effects on the efficiency of OER. The molecular modeling (MM) of the (H2O)(n) clusters (n = 1-100 molecules), the corresponding IR spectra, the molecular orbitals energy levels and the adsorption of free and cluster confined H2O molecules on the Pt surface were studied by the appropriate quantum mechanical (QM) methods. The result of deconvolution of FTIR spectra recorded for USI-DW in the-OH stretching region (similar to 2600-3900 cm(-1)) properly confirmed the expected increase of the single water molecules. The reduction in overpotentials was 82 +/- 8 mV and 158 +/- 12 mV, to reach the J of 1 mA cm(-1) at the typical pHs 12.2 and 13.1, respectively.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000426021200042	29429683

To accomplish this, we have synthesized Ag-Pt core-shell nanoparticles, that contain a thin shell of Pt (similar to 1 nm) uniformly deposited on a larger Ag core (similar to 60 nm). We show that these nanostructures are ideal platforms for in-operando Plasmon Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (PERS) of ORR on Pt. We combined these PERS studies with DFT calculations to assign the measured vibrational spectra to relevant surface intermediates as a function of electrocatalyst potential. These vibrational assignments were further verified and validated by performing PERS measurements using de-oxygenated and heavy oxygen (O-2-18) saturated electrolyte. These studies allowed us to identity the presence of critical reaction intermediates (OH, O-2, OOH, and H2O) as the function of operating voltage on the Pt surface and derive voltage-dependent elementary step mechanisms of the reaction.

Herein, we developed a controlled partial pyrolysis strategy to construct robust NiCo/Fe3O4 heteroparticles within MOF-74 for efficient OER using trimetallic NiCoFe-MOF-74 as precursor. The partial pyrolysis method preserves the framework structure of MOF for effective substrates diffusion while producing highly active nanoparticles. The as-prepared NiCo/Fe3O4/MOF-74 delivered remarkably stable OER current with an overpotential as low as 238 mV at 10.0 mA cm(-2) and an Tafel slop of 29 mV/dec, outperforming those of pristine NiCoFe-MOF-74, totally decomposed MOF derivatives, and most reported non-noble metal based electrocatalysts. The key for the formation of NiCo/Fe3O4/MOF-74 nanostructures is that the metals can be decomposed from NiCoFe-MOF-74 in the order of Ni, Co, and Fe under controlled heat treatment. Density functional theory calculations reveals that the underlying NiCo promotes the OER activity of Fe3O4 through exchange stabilization of active oxygen species.									195	19	0	0	11	0	197			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000451100600029	30352508

The electrocatalytic activities of the catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were evaluated using a three-electrode half-cell design and a full rechargeable Zn-air battery with a 6 M KOH electrolyte. Comprehensive study of combustion synthesis and characterization of synthesized products showed that LaFeO3 had been successfully prepared in a single step of combustion synthesis, while the synthesis of LaCoO3 and LaMnO3 required an extra calcination step. The effects of the glycine/nitrate ratio and the calcination temperature and duration on the particle size and crystallinity of the final products were evaluated. Electrochemical characterization showed that LaMnO3 exhibited the best catalytic activity for both ORR and OER during the initial discharge-charge cycles, especially for the ORR corresponding to the discharge of the Zn-air battery. The order of activity is as follows: LaMnO3 > LaCoO3 > LaFeO3 > CB (carbon black). However, cycling performance measurements showed that the LaMnO3 catalyzed air electrode degraded very quickly, whereas the LaCoO3 catalyzed electrode exhibited the best rechargeability and stability.

To achieve a long life Li-O-2 battery with high round-trip efficiency, various catalysts have been extensively investigated for oxygen cathodes, especially for OER processes. Here, we designed an in situ growth of alpha-MnO2/RuO2 composite on a graphene nanosheet with a carbon embedded structure as the cathode electrode for a Li-O-2 battery. The synergistic catalytic effect between the alpha-MnO, and RuO2 has significantly improved the OER kinetics. The fabricated Li-O-2 battery can deliver a high reversible capacity of 2895 mAh/g(composite) with a low charge overpotential of 0.25 V (0.34 V lower than bare RuO2 cathode). The results revealed that more LiO2 intermediates formed when alpha-MnO2 was introduced into the RuO2 electrode during the oxidation of Li2O2. The facilitation of the initial Li extraction was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which shows that the alpha-MnO, and RuO2 interfaces can stabilize the primary Li ions and Li2-xO2 intermediates, respectively. Subsequently, Li2-xO2 would be easily oxidized to O-2 by RuO2 catalyst. With the synergy between alpha-MnO, and RuO2, the initial delithiation process and O-2 evolution are promoted simultaneously. By combining theoretic and experimental results, we proposed a synergistic catalytic mechanism for the OER processes.									40	1	0	0	2	0	41			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800025

In particular, the effects of 10 mol% Sn substitution on phase evolution, thermal expansion behavior and electrochemical performance of Bi0.5Sr0.5Fe0.9Sn0.1O3-delta (BSFSn) material are systematically investigated. BSFSn crystallizes in cubic perovskite structure with space group Pm-3m. Sn doping is found to decrease the average thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) from 14.7 x 10(-6) K-1 (BSF) to 12.9 x 10(-6) K-1 (BSFSn) within a temperature range of 50-800 degrees C, due to the enlarged metal-oxygen (Sn-O) bond energy in BSFSn. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) result proves that Sn doping promotes the oxygen adsorption ability on BSFSn surface. Consequently, the ORR activity of BSFSn is improved as expected. The polarization resistance (R-p) value of BSFSn cathode is 0.09 Omega cm(2) at 700 degrees C in air, which is lower than BSF. The cathode overpotential is 35.6 mV at a current density of 140.8 mA cm(-2) at 700 degrees C in air. The peak power density of the anode-supported cell reaches 960 mW cm(-2) at 700 degrees C. Furthermore, the relationship between oxygen partial pressure and R-p demonstrates that oxygen surface adsorption-desorption is a major rate-limiting step for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process on BSFSn cathode. These attractive electrochemical properties suggest that BSFSn oxide is a promising potential cathode electrocatalyst for SOFCs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, grid-scale freshwater electrolysis would put a heavy strain on vital water resources. Developing cheap electrocatalysts and electrodes that can sustain seawater splitting without chloride corrosion could address the water scarcity issue. Here we present a multilayer anode consisting of a nickel-iron hydroxide (NiFe) electrocatalyst layer uniformly coated on a nickel sulfide (NiSx) layer formed on porous Ni foam (NiFe/NiSx-Ni), affording superior catalytic activity and corrosion resistance in solar-driven alkaline seawater electrolysis operating at industrially required current densities (0.4 to 1 A/cm(2)) over 1,000 h. A continuous, highly oxygen evolution reaction-active NiFe electrocatalyst layer drawing anodic currents toward water oxidation and an in situ-generated polyatomic sulfate and carbonate-rich passivating layers formed in the anode are responsible for chloride repelling and superior corrosion resistance of the salty-water-splitting anode.									245	18	0	0	12	0	252			0027-8424			WOS:000463069900024	30886092

To mitigate the carbon corrosion in the electrode, the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been investigated recently. It evolves oxygen from water, thereby mitigating carbon corrosion at voltages over 1.5 V, which is typically induced during SU/SD cycles. In this study, carbon-supported IrRuOx catalysts towards OER are synthesized using a sub-substrate method, and their electrochemical and physicochemical properties are analyzed using several methods. Ir1Ru1Ox (Ir:Ru = 1:1 at. ratio in the oxide form) is observed to be the best catalyst in terms of activity and durability. The application of a 2.5 wt% OER catalyst to the cathode improves the carbon corrosion durability of the MEA by approximately 88 %. After 4000 SU/SD cycles, the electrochemical surface areas of the Pt in the OER-added MEA and reference MEA are reduced by 15 % and 57 %, respectively. When the OER catalyst is applied to the reference cathode electrode, it enhances the durability of the MEA without compromising the performance significantly.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000615924100005

Several assumptions concerning the mechanism of the formation of composites that taking into account the oxygen-containing species of lead non-fixed on the surface, located in the near-electrode zone have been proposed. The shape and size of the PbO2 crystals is altered by the presence of polyelectrolyte. The surface is more uniform and the crystals are smaller, there is not a pronounced crystallographic orientation, however the phase content remains practically the same as in the undoped sample. When using composite materials based on lead dioxide containing polyelectrolyte, selective changes in the overvoltage of oxygen evolution and electrochemical conversion of organic substances into aliphatic non-toxic compounds are observed. In this case, the electrocatalytic activity of composite materials depends on the nature and content of the polyelectrolyte additive in the oxide. (C) 2020 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

In this study, nanoscaled nickel-cobalt-iron (NiCoFe) alloy was embedded on conductive boron(B), nitrogen (N) co-doped/biomass-derived carbon aerogel as an OER electrocatalyst. The synthesized electrocatalysts were calcined under different temperatures and with variable dopants. The optimal electrocatalyst (BN/ CA-NiCoFe-600) demonstrated a low overpotential of 321 mV (at current density of 10 mA cm-2) and a minute Tafel slope of 42 mV dec-1, which was even smaller than that of IrO2 and RuO2. Its mass activity and specific activity were calculated to be 201.7 A g-1, and 34.1 cm-2 ECSA, respectively. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst showed excellent stability and durability.

In this contribution, the cesium lead bromide perovskite (CsPbBr3) nanocrystals were first employed as a high-performance cathode for Li-O-2 batteries. The battery with a CsPbBr3 cathode can exhibit the lowest charge overpotential of 0.5 V and the best cycling performance of 400 cycles among all the reported perovskite-based Li-O-2 cells, which represents a new benchmark. Most importantly, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations further prove that the rate limitation step during OER processes is the decomposition of LiO2 to form O-2 and Lit, and the weak adsorption strength between CsPbBr3 surfaces and LiO2 results in a low charge overpotential for the CsPbBr3-based Li-O-2 battery.

Herein, by studying a multidimensional and multifunctional Co/N-C catalyst, we have demonstrated that two categories of preferential characteristics, i.e. activity distinctions between different reactions and feature distinctions between component and structure aspects, for electrocatalysts are not mutually exclusive, but can be well-addressed simultaneously. This rationally designed and cost-effective hybrid catalyst synergically integrates the features, including ample active species, prompt mass transport, excellent conductivity, and structural stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, for an efficient and versatile electrocatalyst. The thus-obtained multidimensional catalyst delivers excellent activities in oxygen reduction and overall water-splitting reactions in conjunction with a good durability, which then enables a prominent performance in a rechargeable Zn-air battery and also demonstrates feasibility in a self-powered water-splitting unit. This study opens up new avenues for the rational design and easy fabrication of multidimensional catalysts with desired performances for various renewable energy applications.									92	5	0	0	2	0	92			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000419188300020

The Fe-Mn composite OCs presented the characteristics of oxygen decoupling, and there is a synergistic effect between the active components using various analytical methods. The maximum syngas yield (0.054 mol/g) and the maximum carbon conversion rate (62.9%) were achieved under the following conditions; temperature at 900 degrees C, steam flow rate at 0.045 ml/min and O/C ratio equal to 1. The OC acts as both oxygen source and catalyst in gasification reaction process, after studying the gasification reaction characteristics between the OC and the model compound. The oxygen transport mechanism and phase evolution law of the OC was revealed by conducting XRD and XPS tests. The migration of lattice oxygen of the OC in CLG transferred from bulk phase to surface phase with the migration pathway of oxygen species OI -> OII -> OIII, and the OC phase underwent the reduction process of (Mn, Fe)(2)O-3 -> (FeO)(0.664)(MnO)(0.336) -> Fe/MnO. The reactivity performance of OCs remained stable after 20-cycle redox experiments, indicating that the Fe-Mn OC was a good candidate OC for the CLG process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000703346000008

The catalyst on Ti substrate with a 7/3 molar ratio between Ru and Ir showed the highest electrocatalytic activity for OER among composite samples in different molar ratios. Moreover, the properties of RuO2IrO2 grown on carbon paper were evaluated by proton exchange membrane water electrolysis single cell. Compared with the micron-particle structure of RuO2IrO2 catalyst on the Ti substrate, the catalyst grown on the carbon paper showed a novel nano dendrite shape and can be used directly as the gas diffusion electrode. Owing to the large surface area of the catalyst, the nano dendrite-shaped RuO2IrO2 catalyst exhibits excellent OER performance in the single cell. Furthermore, a cell voltage of 2.50 V is achieved under 200 mA cm(-2) at 30 degrees C by using the optimal composition RuO2IrO2 (Ru: Ir=7/3) and the commercial 20% Pt/C as anode and cathode, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1115	1975-7220		WOS:000740649500012

Although, both these attributes are crucial for renewable energy and environmental remediation, their effective amalgamation over a single platform is hitherto unexplored, yet extremely demanding. The chemically robust, and non-penetrated charged framework CSMCRI-10 (CSMCRI = Central Salt & Marine Chemicals Research Institute) exemplifies activation induced generation of high density Co(II) nodes with diverse open coordination positions along the unidirectional porous channels, and act as unique bi-functional material. Building on the presence of redox-active [Co2(mu 2-OH)(COO)4] secondary building units, the activated framework (10a) demonstrates efficient water oxidation in alkaline medium (1 M KOH). The MOF requires only 396 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA/cm2 anodic current density, and possesses a Tafel slope of 102 mV/decade with admirable 95.1% Faradaic efficiency, signifying high rate of oxygen evolution reaction. The OER turn-over frequency is found to be within the range of best reported values (0.03s- 1), and the framework stability is preserved in both potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions over 500 consecutive cycles. Further, the Lewis acid functionalized 10a benefits solvent-free CO2 conversion to cyclic carbonate in highly synergistic manner with adequate reusability and broad substrate scope. To the best of tandem catalysis, rarest oxidative carboxylation of CO2 and styrene is realized via singlestep styrene carbonate synthesis with exceptional conversion under relatively mild reaction condition.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724863500006

The samples were characterized via XRD, SEM, EDX and XPS. We demonstrate that NiP X amorphous nanolayers are formed on the surface and they include oxygen atoms forming Ni-OH and P-OH groups. Investigation of the electrocatalytic properties showed high activity of oxygen release during the electrolysis of water in the alkaline medium. Moreover, it was shown that the characteristics of such electrocatalysts changed in the series of samples synthesized after different number of SILD cycles. The best electrocatalytic properties belong to the sample which was acquired as a result of 10 cycles. It is characterized by overpotential values of 305, 390 and 418 mV, at currents of 20, 50 and 100 mA, respectively, as well as Tafel slope of 75 mV/dec. On the basis of the experimental results, it is suggested that the SILD method can be used to synthesize a wide range of nanocomposites that have improved electrocatalytic properties.					6th International Conference on State-of-the Art Trends of Scientific Research of Artificial and Natural Nanoobjects (STRANN6th International Conference on State-of-the Art Trends of Scientific Research of Artificial and Natural Nanoobjects (STRANN	OCT 17-19, 2018OCT 17-19, 2018	St Petersburg State Univ; Lomonosov Moscow State Univ; ITMO Univ; Optec LLCSt Petersburg State Univ; Lomonosov Moscow State Univ; ITMO Univ; Optec LLC	Moscow, RUSSIAMoscow, RUSSIA	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1792-2	WOS:000464910000011

Herein, we report the novel light-driven chlorine evolution reaction (CER) in synthetic seawater using bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) photocatalyst, providing an economical and convenient route for Cl-2 production. A superior Cl-2 production rate of 19.6 mu mol h(-1) (about 27.79 mg L-1 h(-1)) is achieved, which is sufficient for methane functionalization and production of chlorine-based disinfectant. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the Cl- extraction from and insertion into the open structure of BiOCl contribute to the excellent performance. The lattice Cl- could be self-oxidized to form Cl-2, while Cl- in solution would fill the lattice Cl- vacancies, making CER continue. This technique is also applicable to Br-2 production. This work opens up prospects for halogen production based on solar energy.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000696992200004

Accordingly, nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) has attracted considerable attention due to its high electrochemical performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. In this study, nano-sized Ni3S2 binder-free electrodes were directly grown on Ni foam using various methods. The obtained results showed that the interconnected sheet-like Ni3S2 with a hydrophilic surface, which was prepared from Na2S via the hydrothermal method, exhibited the best HER and OER electrocatalytic performance. Its thin nanosheet structure could offer more active centers for the HER and OER in the aqueous alkaline electrolyte and its hydrophilic surface could also facilitate the transfer of ions at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte. The best Ni3S2 electrode synthesized using Na2S exhibited an overpotential of 43 mV and 127 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, it also exhibited superior electrochemical activity and durability for the OER.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1466-8033			WOS:000576731400009

Transition metal phosphides are gradually being considered as prospective catalysts to replace noble metal catalysts such as Pt. Herein, we report an easy way to synthesize cobalt phosphide nanorods grown on a nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide layer composite (CoP@NRGO) via hydrothermal growth and a low-temperature phosphorization process.

Self-Supported ferric phosphide spherical clusters on Ti foil (FeP/Ti) were developed via a low-temperature phosphorization of hydrothermal-synthesized FeOOH/Ti precursors. The FeP/Ti had large specific surface area, high porosity and high conductivity which could provide high catalytic activities. The FeP/Ti electrode showed a good electrocatalytic performance for HER in acidic media with a low onset overpotential of 27 mV, only needed overpotentials of 104 and 218 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively, and had a high exchange current density of 0.46 mA cm(-2) as well as good long-term durability, close to the performance of commercial Pt/C catalysts. In addition, the binder-free preparation method for this self-supported HER electrode could be extended to many other fields.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2365-6549			WOS:000413347200037

Ni doped tungsten carbide nanocubes supported on Ni foam (W1-xNixC NCs/NF) synthesized via a hydrothermal-carbonization methods is reported. W1-xNixC NCs/NF electrocatalysts exhibit excellent catalytic performance with overpotentials lower than 50 mV in both acidic, alkaline and neutral medium. Meanwhile, large electrochemical surface area and better conductivities of W1-xNixC NCs/NF electrocatalysts are deemed in favour of its efficient catalytic properties. Moreover, the electrocatalysts show superior stability in wide pH range.

Herein, a multifunction Li-carbon system was designed by using an aqueous-nonaqueous dual electrolyte to combine a nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon cathode with a metallic lithium anode. It is demonstrated that the nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon exhibits high performance in various applications of O-2 reduction reaction, supercapacitors, and H-2 evolution reaction, which makes the Li-carbon system exhibit multifunctionality. When operated in the ambient with O-2, the system can work as a Li-air fuel cell or/and rechargeable battery with high energy density. When operated in an environment without O-2, the battery can be used as a Li-ion supercapacitor which exhibits long-term cycling stability and improved energy performance. Finally, this cell can also be applied as a Li-water fuel cell for H-2 evolution.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2380-8195			WOS:000392260400006

This treatment proved to significantly enhance the catalytic activity of Ni towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (her). After treatment, the current density of her increases almost four times and is accompanied by the onset potential shift to more positive values. From SEM, no visible changes in Ni particle size and shape were observed after treatment. XPS analysis of the surface of as-prepared Ni particles reveals that it contains Ni-0, NiO, NiOOH and Ni(OH)(2), whereas after treatment Ni atoms exist mainly in the metallic form and as NiOOH. The increase in the activity of Ni particles after the treatment might be due to the higher amount of Ni-0 at the surface. (C) 2012 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the nanocomposite, the Fe2O3 NPs are uniformly anchored on the ultrathin graphene-like NiO nanosheets. At the same time, we also studied the influence of the Fe/Ni molar ratio on the morphology and catalytic activity. The Fe2O3 NPs@NiO NSs nanocomposite possessed a high BET surface area (194.1 m(2) g(-1)), which is very conducive to the charge/mass transfer of electrolyte ions and O-2. Owing to the unique two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures and rational Fe content, the as-prepared Fe2O3 NPs@NiO NSs show high catalytic performance, a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (221 mV), a small Tafel slope (53.4 mV dec(-1)), and 2000 cycle and 20 h long-term durability. The introduction of Fe2O3 NPs is beneficial to accelerating charge transport, increasing the electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), and thus improving the release of oxygen bubbles from the electrode surface.									19	2	0	0	2	0	19			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000643574200047	33356196

From the half cell test. the MnO2-NCNT composite illustrated excellent activities towards ORR and OER in alkaline conditions. Based on the battery test, the composite catalyst displayed outstanding discharge and charge performance while maintaining good stability. In both cases, the marked performance improvements from MnO2-NCNT compared favourably to the NCNT and MnO2, which are the constituents of the composite. In particular, MnO2-NCNT exhibited improved half wave potential by 220 mV compared to MnO2 and much superior OER stability compared to NCNT based on the rotating ring disk voltammetry results.

In this study, non-isothermal low temperature pyrolysis of lignite using in-situ Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was carried out to investigate the evolution of six most abundant functional groups in lignite. The evolution of these functional groups was divided into several stages with different mechanisms and kinetic characteristics. The decomposition of C-O associated with hydroxyls by hydrogen bonds (HBs) played an important role in the pyrolysis process below 400 degrees C. The activation energies for the pyrolysis of lignite at various stages were mostly lower than 70 kJ/mol, and demonstrated the important role of HBs in the low temperature pyrolysis. Additionally, the HBs were mainly related to the aromatic phenol, aromatic ether and phenoxy for C-O, and quinone and carboxyl for C=O. At higher temperature stage (above 300 degrees C), the oxygen contained functional groups, including carboxyl, carbonyl and especially ether, began to decompose, resulting in greater loss of coal materials. At the temperature up to 400 degrees C, the C-C bonds began to break apart, which caused the primary decomposition of aliphatic groups and the increasing intensity of aromatic C-H.

The [NiFeSe]-H(2)ases and some of the [NiFeS]-H(2)ases, biocatalysts for reversible H(2)production from protons and electrons, are exemplars of oxygen tolerant HER catalysts in nature. In the hydrogenase active sites oxygen damage may be extensive (irreversible) as it is for the [FeFe]-H(2)ase or moderate (reversible) for the [NiFe]-H(2)ases. The affinity of oxygen for sulfur, in [NiFeS]-H(2)ase, and selenium, in [NiFeSe]-H(2)ase, yielding oxygenated chalcogens results in maintenance of the core NiFe unit, and myriad observable but inactive states, which can be reductively repaired. In contrast, the [FeFe]-H(2)ase active site has less possibilities for chalcogen-oxygen uptake and a greater chance for O-2-attack on iron. Exposure to O(2)typically leads to irreversible damage. Despite the evidence of S/Se-oxygenation in the active sites of hydrogenases, there are limited reported synthetic models. This perspective will give an overview of the studies of O(2)reactions with the hydrogenases and biomimetics with focus on our recent studies that compare sulfur and selenium containing synthetic analogues of the [NiFe]-H(2)ase active sites.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000569982100002	34094202

Transition-metal carbides and nitrides have attracted much attention on account of their specific noble-metal-like d-state density electron structure. Herein, we synthesized WN-W2C nanocomposites uniformly encapsulated in nitrogen-doped (4.21 atom%) carbon shell through in situ carbonized WOX/aniline hybrid nanoparticles. The catalysts displayed remarkable performance with a low overpotential of only 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent long-term durability performance i.e., 5000 cycles owing to the protection of the carbon shell. The enhanced catalytic activities arose from the synergistic effect of tungsten nitride (WN) and tungsten carbide (W2C) nanocrystals and abundant nitrogen content. The current study might inspire the design of advanced and performance-oriented metal carbide and nitride-hybrid based electrocatalysts for wider applications in hydrogen evolution reaction.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000456501100027

Selecting the proper cobalt precursor, the nucleation of CoxOy crystallites at the Mn3O4@a CoMn2O4 surface could be simultaneously promoted to form Mn3O4@CoMn2O4-CoxOy NPs. Such heterostructured NPs were investigated for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR, OER) in alkaline solution. Mn3O4@ CoMn2O4-Cox0y NPs with [Co]/[Mn] = 1 showed low overpotentials of 0.31 Vat(-3) mA.cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV.dec(-1) for ORR, and overpotentials of 0.31 V at 10 mA"cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 81 mV.dec(-1) for OER, thus outperforming commercial Pt-, IrO2-based and previously reported transition metal oxides. This cation-exchange-based synthesis protocol opens up a new approach to design novel heterostructured NPs as efficient nonprecious metal bifunctional oxygen catalysts.									57	4	0	0	3	0	58			1944-8244			WOS:000379794100051	27323284

Here, we report a nickel-stabilized, ruthenium dioxide (Ni-RuO2) catalyst, a promising alternative to iridium, with high activity and durability in acidic OER for PEM water electrolysis. While pristine RuO2 showed poor acidic OER stability and degraded within a short period of continuous operation, the incorporation of Ni greatly stabilized the RuO2 lattice and extended its durability by more than one order of magnitude. When applied to the anode of a PEM water electrolyser, our Ni-RuO2 catalyst demonstrated >1,000 h stability under a water-splitting current of 200 mA cm(-2), suggesting potential for practical applications. Density functional theory studies, coupled with operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, confirmed the adsorbate-evolving mechanism on Ni-RuO2, as well as the critical role of Ni dopants in stabilization of surface Ru and subsurface oxygen for improved OER durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000870615900001	36266572

Many electrochemical reactions proceed through multiple pathways, requiring highly selective catalysts. Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have emerged as a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis. In addition to the widely perceived advantages of maximized active site utilization and substantially reduced metal content, they have shown different catalytic selectivities in some electrocatalytic reactions compared to the traditional nanoparticle (NP)-based catalysts. Although there have been significant advances in their synthesis, the highly energetic nature of a single atomic site has made the preparation of atomically dispersed metal catalysts rely on empiricism rather than rational design. Consequently, the structural comprehension of a single atomic site and the understanding of its unusual electrocatalytic selectivity remain largely elusive. In this Account, we describe our endeavors toward developing general synthetic approaches for atomically dispersed metal catalysts for the discovery of new selective and active electrocatalysts and to understand their catalytic nature. We introduce synthetic approaches to produce a wide range of nonprecious- and precious-metal-based atomically dispersed catalysts and control their coordination environments. Metallomacrocyclic-compound-driven top-down and metal salt/heteroatom layer-based bottom-up strategies, coupled with a SiO2-protective-layer-assisted method, have been developed that can effectively generate single atomic sites while mitigating the formation of metallic NPs. The low-temperature gas-phase ligand exchange method can reversibly tune the coordination structure of the atomically dispersed metal sites. We have used the prepared atomically dispersed metal catalysts as model systems to investigate their electrocatalytic reactivity for renewable energy conversion and commodity chemical production reactions, in which high selectivity is important. The reactions of our interest include the following: (i) the oxygen reduction reaction, where O2 is reduced to either H2O or H2O2 via the four-electron or two electron pathway, respectively; (ii) the CO2 reduction reaction, which should suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction; and (iii) the chlorine evolution reaction, which competes with the oxygen evolution reaction. The type of metal center to which the reactant is directly bound is found to be the most important in determining the selectivity, which originates from the dramatic changes in the binding energy of each metal center with the reactants. The coordination structure surrounding the metal center also has a significant effect on the selectivity; its control can modulate the oxidation state of the metal center, thereby altering the binding strength with the reactants. We envisage that future advances in the synthesis of atomically dispersed metal catalysts, combined with the growing power of computational, spectroscopic, and microscopic methods, will bring their synthesis to the level of rational design. Elaborately designed catalysts can overcome the current limits of catalytic selectivity, which will help establish the field of atomically dispersed metal catalysts as an important branch of catalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000852613100001	36067418

In this study, Al-Bi-Zn composite powders were designed by phase diagram calculation and then prepared via the gas atomization method. The results indicated that the conversion yield of Al-12Bi-7Zn (wt.%) powder reached 98% with stable hydrogen production within 280 min at 50 degrees C. When composite powder reacted with NaCl solution to produce hydrogen, the dormant period of the reaction process was significantly shortened, but the conversion rate was slightly reduced. Additionally, the evolution of powder morphology during the reaction was investigated. The results showed that the continuous cracking of the powder led to the continuous exposure of fresh Al to react. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, an in situ integration engineering strategy of oxygen-vacancy and core-shell heterojunction to fabricate an anemone-like CoP@CoOOH core-shell heterojunction with rich oxygen-vacancies supported on carbon paper (CoP@CoOOH/CP), is described. Benefiting from the synergy of CoP core and oxygen-vacancy-rich CoOOH shell, the as-obtained CoP@CoOOH/CP catalyst displays low overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER (89.6 mV/81.7 mV) and OER (318 mV/200 mV) in neutral and alkaline media, respectively. Notably, a two-electrode electrolyzer, using CoP@CoOOH/CP as bifunctional catalyst to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), only needs low-cell voltages in neutral (1.65 V) and alkaline (1.52 V) electrolyte. Besides, systematically experimental and theoretical results reveal that the core-shell heterojunction efficiently accelerates the catalytic kinetics and strengthens the structural stability, while rich oxygen-vacancies efficiently decrease the kinetic barrier and activation energy, and reduce the energy barrier of the rate-determining-step for OER intermediates, thus intrinsically boosting OER performance. This work clearly demonstrates that oxygen-vacancy and core-shell heterojunction engineering provide an effective strategy to design highly-efficient non-precious, bi-functional electrocatalysts for pH-universal water splitting.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000745529200001	35064631

Artificial photosynthesis consists of light-harvesting and charge-separation processes together with catalytic units of water oxidation and reduction. Nanosized mesoporous silica-alumina was utilized to encapsulate organic charge-separation molecules inside the nanospace to elongate the lifetimes of the charge-separated states, as observed in the photosynthetic reaction centers. Metal nanoparticles with controlled shapes and sizes have also been utilized as efficient catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water with reductants by using electron donor-acceptor organic molecules as photocatalysts. The control of the shape and size of metal nanoparticles plays a very important role in achieving high catalytic performance in catalytic hydrogen evolution in water reduction and also in catalytic oxygen evolution in water oxidation.									45	0	0	0	3	0	45			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000328689000004	23940015

However, the activity for the HOR on platinum falls two orders of magnitude from acidic to alkaline media, which has not been completely understood yet. Here, we provide an explanation for that. Both the HER and the HOR were investigated on the three basal planes of platinum in a pH range near neutral pH conditions in buffered solutions in the absence of anion specific adsorption for guaranteeing the protons availability. Whereas changes in the pH from acid to neutral values produced negligible effects on the HER, the HOR was found to be pH sensitive, even under near neutral pH conditions. From these results, it can be consistently reasoned that the drastic fall in the activity of the HOR on platinum from acidic to alkaline media is an effect of the charge on the electrode, which is more negative as the pH increases. With the aid of density functional theory calculations, kinetic arguments explaining the unfavorable effect that negative charge on the electrode has on the HOR are provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Based upon dealloying foam, Fe-Ni hydroxide nanosheets network structure is designed on the surface of Fe-Ni alloy foam. The ratio of Ni/Fe elements was adjusted to realize the optimal catalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Herein, we developed a new cobalt phosphosulfide nanosheet on carbon fiber paper (CFP) substrate electrocatalyst (Co2-xSP/CFP) following a simple two-step electrodeposition method. The cobalt sulfide nanosheets were first deposited onto CFP by cyclic voltammetry. Then, the surface structure and P/S ratio as well as the Co3+/Co2+ ratio of the phosphosulfide nanosheets were well tuned by regulating the cycling numbers of the phosphorous electrodeposition. Benefiting from the hierarchical structure, distinct phosphosulfide species, as well as a high Co3+ content derived from partial S substitution with P and nonstoichiometric phase, the as-synthesized Co2-xSP/CFP exhibits remarkable activity with an overpotential of 279 mV at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 54 mVdec(-1) and excellent long-term stability towards OER (overpotential increase of only 4.7% within 60 h). Structural analysis after stability test indicates that cobalt oxide/hydroxide species are formed on the surface, which contribute to the high performance and excellent durability for oxygen evolution. This provides a simple and facile approach to rationally design and synthesize transition metal phosphosulfides for advanced electrochemical application.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-0216			WOS:000436934000008

In this study, we focus on increasing oxygen evolution potential of Cr-SnO2/Ti and Cr-Sb-SnO2/Ti electrodes with the pyrolytic method. XRD, SEM and XPS techniques had been applied to characterize the microstructures and chemical compositions of the samples. Electrochemical measurements had been performed to evaluate the oxygen evolution potential as a criterion of the wastewater treatment efficiency. The results show that co-doping of Sb and Cr improved the crystallinity and grain size of SnO2 coating, and Cr existed in the form of Cr(III) valence states. The Cr doping treatment improved the electronic conductivity and the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes. DFT calculation of the band-structure indicates Cr doped SnO2 had a superior electrical conductivity, where Cr atom acts as an acceptor providing vacancies for electron transportation.

In this study, nanostructured Fe-doped CuCo(OH)(2) was discovered to be a precedent electrocatalyst for OER with low overpotential, low Tafel slope, good durability, and high electrochemically active surface sites at reduced mass loadings. Fe-doped CuCo(OH)(2) nanosheets are made using a hydrothermal synthesis process. These nanosheets are clumped together to form a highly open hierarchical structure. When used as an electrocatalyst, the Fe-doped CuCo(OH)(2) nanosheets required an overpotential of 260 mV to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2). Also, it showed a small Tafel slope of 72.9 mV dec(-1), and superior stability while catalyzing the generation of O-2 continuously for 20 hours. The Fe-doped CuCo(OH)(2) was found to have a large number of active sites which provide hierarchical and stable transfer routes for both electrolyte ions and electrons, resulting in exceptional OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1225-0562	2287-7258		WOS:000812910700001

Herein, we propose an effective strategy for nitrogen doping in NiCo2O4 (NCO) nanowire arrays using NH3 plasma treatment. N-doped NCO contains oxygen vacancies with nitrogen atoms, nickel/cobalt nitrides, and high concentrations of Ni2+ and Co2+ within the structure, leading to high electrical conductivity. As expected, N-doped NCO electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for supercapacitors and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysis in KOH electrolyte. This work provides a promising pathway toward developing advanced electrodes.									49	3	0	0	2	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459724300052

Here, MIL-53(Fe) and Ni(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O are incorporated into the electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNFs) to prepare the nickel-iron spinel-based catalysts (Fe2O3/NiFe2O4@CNFs) with 1D and porous structure. The marked Fe2O3/NiFe2O4@CNFs-2 catalyst has a tube diameter of approximately 300 nm, a high surface area of 282.4 m(2) g(-1) and a hydrophilic surface (contact angle of 16.5 degrees), which obtains a promising bifunctional activity with Delta E = 0.74 V (E-1/2 = 0.84 V (ORR) and E-j10 = 1.58 V (OER)) in alkaline media. Fe2O3/NiFe2O4@CNFs-2 has a higher catalytic stability (93.35%) than Pt/C (89.36%) for 30,000 s tests via an efficient 4e(-) ORR pathway. For OER, Fe2O3/NiFe2O4@CNFs-2 obtains a low overpotential of 350 mV and a high Faraday efficiency of 92.7%. NiFe2O4 (Ni2+ in tetrahedral position) relies on its variable valence states (NiOOH and/or FeOOH) to obtain good catalytic activity and stability for OER, while CNFs wrap/protect the active components (FeeN and graphic N) in the carbon skeleton to effectively improve the charge transfer (conductivity), activity and stability for ORR. Porous 1D nanofiber structure provides abundant smooth pathways for mass transfer. It indicates that the bimetallic active substances can promote bifunctional activity by synergistically changing the oxide/spinel interface structure. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The electrical parameters of the electrode solution interface were obtained by fitting the experimental impedance data either to a R(Ohm)(R(f)C(f))(R(ct)C(dl))L (for the Ir0.3Ti0.7O2 electrode) or a R'(Ohm)(QR(ct))L (for PtOx-containing electrodes) equivalent circuit, where Q = constant phase element. The impedance spectrum in the inert region, -0.6 to 0.45 V, is an almost vertical line, indicating that the interfacial impedance is essentially capacitive. The ohmic component obtained from EIS (R(Ohm) = 2.2 Ohm cm(2)) for the Ir0.3Ti0.7O2 electrode is consistent with the value obtained from the Tafel plot (R(Ohm) = 2.4 Ohm cm(2)). The substitution of Pt for Ti in the binary system results in a dramatic increase in the R(ct) value, ie, the reaction becomes more difficult in the presence of this oxide. It was also observed that the introduction of PtOx causes large morphological changes in the binary system. The different behaviour of the IrO2 + TiO2 system from the other oxide compositions is attributed to the instability of the latter oxides in alkaline solution.					3rd International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy3rd International Symposium on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy	MAY 07-12, 1995MAY 07-12, 1995		YSERMONDE, BELGIUMYSERMONDE, BELGIUM	50	3	0	0	1	3	50			0013-4686			WOS:A1996UK66700040

Cu, Ag and Au NDs are directly grown on glassy carbon plate (GCP) from the mixture of their precursor solutions and Zn dust. The formed NDs are uniformly distributed to the substrate and obtained the unique structures with sharp tips and tertiary branches. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized NDs towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is further investigated in 0.5 M H2SO4 using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and the Tafel slope. The results demonstrate that the nanodendrites formed through the GRR process exhibit greater catalytical activity towards HER in comparison to the polycrystalline Cu, Ag and Au. The prepared Au NDs exhibits the highest catalytic performance with a current density of -10.68 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 67 mV and a low Tafel slope of 65 mV dec(-1). The simple and easy synthesis approach, the unique morphology and high electrocatalytic activity and excellent stability make the developed Cu, Ag and Au NDs highly efficient catalysts for green energy and electrochemical applications.

This paper reported a glycerol-assisted solvothermal strategy to synthesize Ru-based electrocatalyst (Ru-G/CC), in-situ growing Ru nanoparticles (NPs) on carbon cloth (CC). The optimal Ru-G/CC exhibits a boosted HER activity (overpotential of 40 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope 76 mV dec(-1)), surpassing benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C; experimental characterization and DFT calculations verified that Ru NPs with a mixed amorphous/ crystalline structure in Ru-G/CC effectively decrease the reaction energy barrier in HER. Also, the hydrothermally derived Ru-H2O/CC-350 exhibited a high electrocatalytic OER activity (overpotential of 270 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope 63 mV dec(-1)), exceeding the commercial RuO2.

Identification of the active structure during the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is critical to industrial water-alkali electrolysers, remains elusive and is a field of intense research. Here, by virtue of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy on a uniform cobalt single-site catalyst, we report the atomic-level identification of the dynamic structure of catalytically active sites under alkaline HER. Our results reveal the formation of a high-valence HO-Co-1-N-2 moiety by the binding between isolated Co-1-N-4 sites with electrolyte hydroxide, and further unravel the preferred water adsorption reaction intermediate H2O-(HO-Co-1-N-2). Theoretical simulations rationalize this structural evolution and demonstrate that the highly oxidized Co sites are responsible for the catalytic performance. These findings suggest the electrochemical susceptibility of active sites, providing a coordination-engineered strategy for the advance of single-site catalysis.									409	24	0	0	49	0	410			2520-1158			WOS:000458554800008

In the semiconductor photocatalytic dispersion, noble metallic Pt is usually used as a co-catalyst to catalyze those reactions. However, Pt can also act as an active center for H-2 and O-2 recombination back reaction, which results in the very low photocatalytic efficiency for H-2 generation. Here we reported that the recombination rate nearly linearly increased with the increase of Pt loading amount in the low Pt loading region, while decreased in high Pt loading region. Very trace amount of fluorine ion can remarkably inhibit hydrogen and oxygen recombination. Detail study indicated that this inhibition was achieved via the occupation of hydrogen and oxygen adsorption and activation sites by fluorine ion over Pt due to the strong tendency of adsorption of fluorine ion on Pt. By taking advantage of this inhibition role of fluorine ions, the Pt/TiO2 activity for water splitting is remarkable enhanced up to 23 times. Isotope experiments with D2O and (H2O)-O-18 confirmed hydrogen and oxygen were both from water. Our results clearly indicated that the excellent photocatalytic performance for water splitting over fluorine doped on TiO2 might be related to the role of fluorine inhibition on H-2 and O-2 recombination back reaction, which would shine light to the new photocatalyst preparation for water splitting.

Herein, an in situ Co and N co-doping method was developed to improve the electrocatalytic performance of Ni3S2 catalysts. The Co-N-Ni3S2/NF is successfully synthesized for the first time by a one-step hydrothermal method, wherein nickel foam, thioacetamide and Co(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O are used as the nickel source, sulfur source, nitrogen source and cobalt source. Co-N-Ni3S2/NF exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity (an overpotential of 285 mV@50 mA cm(-2)) and hydrogen evolution reaction activity (an overpotential of 215 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M KOH solution. The electrolytic cell displayed a low cell voltage of 1.50 V when the Co-N-Ni3S2/NF material was used as the bifunctional water splitting electrocatalyst, which is one of the best catalysts reported so far. Density functional theory calculations show that Co-N-Ni3S2/NF exhibits stronger water adsorption energy than those of N-Ni3S2/NF, Co-Ni3S2/NF and Ni3S2/NF. It is proved that the doping of Co and N can effectively regulate the electron cloud density of Ni, thus enhancing the electrochemical activity of Co-N-Ni3S2/NF.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000659527200001	34109953

Inspired by the high stability of the self-supported catalyst and the synergistic effect of the bimetallic transition metal catalyst, MnCo2S4 microrugby balls were successfully prepared on carbon cloth by a two-step hydrothermal method in this work. The prepared MnCo2S4/CC exhibits remarkable electrochemical performance due to the stable self-supporting design and lavish porous structure, as well as the high inherent electrical conductivity of sulphide. The overpotential of MnCo2S4/CC is only 180 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 161 mV lower than that of MnCo2O4/CC (341 mV). The Tafel slope of MnCo2S4/CC is 145.7 mV dec(-1), which is less than that of MnCo2O4/CC (157.5 mV dec(-1)). The OER performance of MnCo2S4/CC is significantly improved due to its high electrochemically active surface area and conductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that MnCo2S4/CC has a higher electron density than MnCo2O4/CC, which indicates that it has better conductivity. These results indicate that it is a feasible method to optimize the performance of the electrocatalysts by combining the large electrochemical surface area provided by the porous structure of the self-supported catalyst and the large electrical conductivity of the sulphide.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000821521500001

Herein, Pt nanoparticles are loaded on Prussian blue analogues (Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) and Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) nanocubes) to obtain improved catalytic activity. Co-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) and Ni-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2) are rationally selected because of their containing of the fascinating transition metals of Co and Ni species. Using the hybrid catalyst as the modular system, we demonstrate the inspiring effect of Pt on the OER activity of MOFs. Detailed exploration conclusively demonstrates that Pt supplies combined advantages for the enhanced OER activity of MOFs, such as improving the intrinsic catalytic activity by tuning the valence state of transition metals (Co, Ni), increasing active sites, and enhancing charge transfer. Moreover, thorough electrochemical studies are also performed to declare the key role of Pt in the excellent catalytic activity and stability. We believe that introduction of trace amounts of Pt or other noble metals will be an effective solution to achieve a significant improvement in the OER activity of MOFs.									31	1	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000417341900050

Here we report the successful doping of Ni2B with Fe/Co to form highly ordered FeNiB and CoNiB electrocatalysts with a tetragonal Ni2B structure. A highly crystalline FeNiB electrode is found to have a very low polarization overpotential of 257 mV for the OER and a water splitting potential of 1.54 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). XRD refinement, XPS and XAFS characterization found that doping with iron leads to the weakening of the bond strength of TM-B, which facilitates the adsorption of oxygen. During the OER process, the increasing dissolution of boron oxides promotes the effective exposure of metal active centers and boosts the catalytic performance. Theoretical calculations reveal that the substitution of Fe atoms in Ni2B make its DOS near the Fermi level higher by 2.78 times compared to that of the original Ni2B, which helps to increase the electronic conductivity and the catalytic performance.									19	0	0	0	1	0	18			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900048

We demonstrate a powerful and environment friendly two-step electrochemical engineering of the highly ordered two-dimensional NiCo2O4 nanoflakes trapped with NiMoO4 nanoparticles on Ni foam. The vertically self-assembled NiCo2O4 nanoflakes offer easiest paths for the ion and electron transport. Moreover, the synergistic effect between nanoflakes and nanoparticles provide large active surface area for electrochemical energy storage and oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. Compared to NiCo2O4 nanoflakes NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 core-shell electrode exhibited an enhanced electrochemical performance having an excellent specific capacitance (3705 F g(-1) at 1.5 A g(-1)), high rate capability (95.1% for 20-fold increase of the current density), and a stable cycle life (94.6% for 5000 charge-discharge cycles). Moreover, it showed an overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 150 mVdec(-1). and 100% of stability for 5 h of continuous operation in alkaline medium. Moreover, as-fabricated NiCo2O4/NiMoO4//NiCo2O4/NiMoO4 symmetric supercapacitor delivered highest energy density of 76.45 Wh kg(-1) and cycle life of 88% after 5000 cycles. Thus, present study demonstrates sustainable engineering approac.h to fabricate highly ordered two-dimensional heterostructures for various electrochemical applications.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000558707400108

Moderate heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide (<= 700 degrees C) leads to the formation of nickel(II) oxide (nano)particles, which exhibit reduced OER activity the higher the heat treatment temperature was. In this work, we report that heat treatment of nickel(II) hydroxide in air at even higher temperatures (60 min at 900 degrees C) results in an oxide material with high OER activity superior to that of the nickel(II) hydroxide. Similarly, the stability of the nickel(II) oxide under electrochemical conditions is increased compared to nickel(II) hydroxide. Electrochemical in situ Raman measurements show the formation of surface nickel oxy-hydroxides (NiOOH) at positive potentials and are significantly affected by the initial heat treatment. From XPS, Raman, and XRD results, it is concluded that a Ni3+-enriched phase, possibly a higher-valent mixed nickel oxide, is present at the surface of the nickel(II) oxide sample treated at 900 degrees C resulting in an increased OER activity compared to NiOOH. This basic understanding of high-temperature-treated nickel oxide may contribute to resolving the present stability issues of OER electrocatalysts and may help to leverage alkaline electrolysis as important key technology for a renewable energy supply.									25	0	0	0	3	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000526394500010

Relative to the inert microscale MoS2, nanoscale MoS2 showed significantly improved catalytic activity toward the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER). The decrease in particle size was accompanied by an increase in catalytic activity. Particles with a size of around 2nm exhibited the best dual ORR and HER performance with a four-electron ORR process and an HER onset potential of -0.16V versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This is the first investigation on the size-dependent effect of the ORR activity of MoS2, and a four-electron transfer route was found. The exposed abundant Mo edges of the MoS2 nanoparticles were proven to be responsible for the high ORR catalytic activity, whereas the origin of the improved HER activity of the nanoparticles was attributed to the plentiful exposed S edges. This newly discovered process provides a simple protocol to produce inexpensive highly active MoS2 catalysts that could easily be scaled up. Hence, it opens up possibilities for wide applications of MoS2 nanoparticles in the fields of energy conversion and storage.									217	8	0	0	21	0	218			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000323514600023	23873743

Buddie								Effects of Electrochemical Conditioning on Nickel-Based Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts								ACS CATALYSIS				12	6			10384	10399		10.1021/acscatal.2c0100110384				AUG 19 2022	2022	Electrochemical conditioning via chronopotentiom-etry (CP) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) is essential for the activation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. While many reports have activated OER electrocatalysts using either CP or CV, the inherent differences between these two electrochemical conditioning methods for the activation of OER electrocatalytic materials have yet to be explored. Here, we investigate the effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on a Ni-based OER precatalyst and substrate in Fe-purified and Fe-unpurified KOH electrolytes by employing (i) Ni foil, (ii) NiSe precatalyst films with different thicknesses on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate, and (iii) NiSe precatalyst films on Ni foil substrates. It was found that CV electrochemical conditioning can result in a higher degree of in situ oxidation and Fe incorporation for Ni-based precatalysts and substrates compared to CP electrochemical conditioning. In turn, this brought about different material properties (e.g., in situ oxidized layer thickness, composition, crystallinity, and morphology) and electrochemical characteristics (e.g., active surface area, electron transport limitation, and intrinsic activity) of Ni-based electrocatalysts, thereby not only affecting their OER activity but also complicating the interpretation of the origin of OER activity. This study identifies the distinct effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on Ni-based OER electrocatalysts and provides insight into the choice of the electrochemical conditioning method to better investigate OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000843318500001

However, the routes commonly employed in their synthesis present synthetic bottlenecks with reliance on sacrificial materials, the use of high temperatures, long reaction times, and little ability to control morphology, thus compromising their scaleup. Herein, we present the single-pot, electrochemical synthesis of high surface area, doped metal titanate nanostructures, including Na2Ti3O7 (NTO), 25 wt % Sn:NTO, 5 wt % Fe:NTO, and 3 wt % Cu:NTO. The synergistic use of the cathodic corrosion method with suspended droplet alloying (SDA) led to materials with excellent homogeneity, presenting a promising route for the screening, production, and discovery of electroactive materials. As proof of concept of the synthetic control and impact on reactivity, we found that the photoanodic oxygen evolution activity of the nanomaterials was adversely affected by Fe and Sn doping into NTO while Cu doping, at 3 wt %, displayed significant improvement. This work demonstrates the ability of the cathodic corrosion method to obtain compositionally and structurally controlled mixed-metal oxides in a rapid fashion, thus creating new opportunities in the field of materials engineering and the systematic study of compositional gradients on the (photo)electrochemical performance of metal oxide nanoparticles.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600017

Herein, we introduce electron-deficient metal on semiconducting metal oxides-consisting of Ir (Rh, Au, Ru)-MoO3 embedded by graphitic carbon layers (IMO) using an electrospinning method. We systematically investigate IMO's structure, electron transfer behaviors, and OER catalytic performance by combining experimental and theoretical studies. Remarkably, IMO with an electron-deficient metal surface (Irx+; x > 4) exhibit a low overpotential of only similar to 156 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability in acidic media due to the high oxidation state of metal on MoO3. Furthermore, the proton dissociation pathway is suggested via surface oxygen serving as proton acceptors. This study suggests high stability with high catalytic performance in these materials by creating electron-deficient surfaces and provides a general, unique strategy for guiding the design of other metal-semiconductor nanocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19				2041-1723		WOS:000701980200022	34584105

Electrochemical water splitting, as an environmental-friendly way to produce H-2 of high-purity, is drawing more and more attention. Conductive nitrogen-doped carbon frameworks derived from metal-organic frameworks(MOFs) have been applied as promising electrocatalysts thanks to their superior conductivity, numerous active sites and hierarchical porous structures. However, traditional uncontrolled pyrolysis will lead to aggregation or fusion of the metal sites in MOFs or even cause collapse of the three-dimensional structures. Herein, we provide a confinement pyrolysis strategy to fabricate a CoCu bimetallic N-doped carbon framework derived from MOFs, which exhibits satisfactory catalytic performance with overpotentials of 199 mV towards hydrogen evolution reaction and 301 mV towards oxygen evolution reaction to reach 10 mA/cm(2) in an alkaline solution. This work presents further inspirations for preserving the original skeleton of MOFs during high temperature pyrolysis in order to obtain more stable and efficient electrocatalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-9040	2210-3171		WOS:000753818800001

Anodic oxidation of the Ti felts leads to the formation of a TiO2 nanotube layer. The high specific surface area allows for a particularly efficient utilization of the noble metal catalyst. Its loading in the nanoporous system is controlled accurately and minimized systematically by atomic layer deposition. The electrochemical activity towards water splitting of both metals is investigated in acidic media by cyclic voltammetry and steady-state electrolysis for various catalyst loadings. An optimal oxygen evolution reaction is found for a catalyst loading of 76 mu g cm(-2) resulting in a mass activity of 345 Ag-1 at eta-0.47 V, whereas the simultaneous presence of Pt at the surface is demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and by the high activity observed for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2196-0216			WOS:000461673300017	30775220

Herein, we report that oxygen-incorporation in Co2P, a noble metal-free co-catalyst used for forming a hetero-structure photocatalyst CdS/o-Co2P, greatly improves the efficiency and durability for photocatalytic hydrogen production from water. Regulating the kinetics of water reduction by different oxygen incorporation levels (determined by phosphorization time) was investigated to optimize the activity of photocatalytic H-2 evolution. The intimate interaction between the CdS nanorods and cocatalyst o-Co2P enhances the separation of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Consequently, the optimal loading content of o-Co2P is 5 wt% for CdS, phosphorization time is 80 min, giving a photocatalytic H-2 production rate of 184.48 mmol g(-1) h(-1), and the apparent quantum yield at 420 nm over CdS/o-Co2P-5 wt% reaches 22.17%. This study provides a simple method for constructing low cost and high performance photocatalysts, which enhance photocatalytic H-2 evolution.									49	1	0	0	8	0	49			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000432878400029

This study reports a low-cost Mo, Fe codoped NiCoPx electrocatalysts derived from Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue and following phosphorization process. Benefitted from the optimized electronic configuration, hierarchical structure and abundant active sites, the Mo,Fe-NiCoPx/NF electrode has shown competitive oxygen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 197 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction performance (eta(10)& nbsp;= 99 mV) when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the integrated water splitting device assembled by Mo, Fe-NiCoPx/NF as both anode and cathode only needs a voltage of 1.545 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory results further confirm that the Mo, Fe codoped heterostructure can synergistically optimize the d-band center and Gibbs free energy during electrocatalytic processes, thus accelerating the kinetics of electrochemical water splitting. This work demonstrates the importance of rational combination of metal doping and interface engineering for advanced catalytic materials.

Now, a general pi-electron-assisted strategy to anchor single-atom sites (M=Ir, Pt, Ru, Pd, Fe, Ni) on a heterogeneous support is reported. The M atoms can simultaneously anchor on two distinct domains of the hybrid support, four-fold N/C atoms (M@NC), and centers of Co octahedra (M@Co), which are expected to serve as bifunctional electrocatalysts towards the HER and the OER. The Ir catalyst exhibits the best water-splitting performance, showing a low applied potential of 1.603 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH solution with cycling over 5 h. DFT calculations indicate that the Ir@Co (Ir) sites can accelerate the OER, while the Ir@NC3 sites are responsible for the enhanced HER, clarifying the unprecedented performance of this bifunctional catalyst towards full water splitting.									133	10	0	0	4	0	133			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000477387700001	31173428

Herein we apply first-principles calculations to systematically analyze the crystal structures, electronic properties, free energies during the HER and OER processes, surface energies and crystal formation energies of the three types of vanadium carbides, i.e., V4C3, V8C7 and VC. We show that all these vanadium carbides are metallic, which enables efficient electron transport from the bulk to the surface of the catalysts. All these vanadium carbides exhibit excellent HER performance but show poor OER catalytic activity. In particular, the V8C7 (110) surface shows the best catalytic performance for its relatively small |Delta G(H*)| value (-0.114 eV) for HER. Emergence of natural carbon vacancies gives rise to large surface energy, proper hydrogen adsorption energy, low crystal formation energy and weak bond strength in V8V7, which guarantees its leading position among the three vanadium carbides. In addition, a remarkable resemblance between VC/V8C7 and Pt in their electronic structures on (110) and (111) surfaces are found, which indicates a Pt-like HER mechanism in these vanadium carbides. Our results thus bring new insights to the theoretical understanding of the excellent HER performance of vanadium carbides.									11	2	0	0	1	0	11				2046-2069		WOS:000501620400039	35542271

Herein, we propose single atom catalysts (SACs) as promising catalysts for efficient hydrogen isotope separation. Pt SACs and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) have been fabricated on nanoarray-structured nitrogen-doped graphite foil (NGF) substrate by a polyol reduction method. The as prepared Pt-1/NGF electrode exhibits high activity and selectivity toward HER with a low overpotential of 0.022 V at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) and a high separation factor of 6.83 for hydrogen and deuterium separation, much better than Pt NPs counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations ascribe the high activity and selectivity to the constructed Pt-N2C2 structure. This work develops a new opportunity for the design and application of high-efficiency and stable SACs toward hydrogen isotope separation by electrolysis of water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000760740600001

Moreover, it can act as bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, exhibiting a low voltage of 1.60 V and an excellently stability up to 24 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).

Martian conditions that generate reactive oxygen species involve the decomposition of H2O2 at temperatures of around 278 K under relatively high doses of C-band ultraviolet radiation (UVC). This process is further amplified by the presence of iron oxides and perchlorates. Photosynthetic organisms exhibit a number of evolutionary traits that allow them to withstand both oxidative stress and UVC radiation. Here, we examine the effect of free radicals produced by the decomposition of H2O2 under emulated martian conditions on the viability of Scenedesmus dimorphus, a unicellular alga that is resistant to UVC radiation and varying levels of perchlorate and H2O2, both of which are present on Mars. Identification and quantification of free radicals formed under these conditions were performed with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. These results were correlated with the viability of S. dimorphus, and the formation of oxygen-based free radicals and survival of the alga were found to be strongly dependent on the amount of H2O2 available. For H2O2 amounts close to those present in the rarefied martian environment, the products of these catalytic reactions did not have a significant effect on the algal population growth curve.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1531-1074	1557-8070		WOS:000637385800001	33819428

Therefore, in this paper, we report a simple low-temperature method which is template-free and environmentally-friendly to fabricate the Ni nanodendrites (Ni NDs) manifesting the excellent HER catalytic performances. This method is a simple one-step reduction, and at 50 degrees C we obtain the Ni NDs(50) that exhibit a low overpotential of 49 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and a small Tafel slope of 32.70 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Besides, the Ni NDs(50) exhibit the favorable stability for 22 h. The superior HER performance may be attributed to the exposure of more electrochemical surface areas due to the multiple branching dendrite structure. Hence, our research provides a simple method for large-scale preparing nickel-based electmcatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2468-8231			WOS:000722211800004

Such electrodes are typically presumed to operate by the same redox mediation mechanisms as the analogous soluble molecules, with electron transfer and substrate activation in separate elementary steps. Here we uncover solvent-dependent concerted reaction mechanisms for cobalt porphyrins attached to glassy carbon electrodes by flexible aliphatic linkages. In acetonitrile, outer-sphere Co-II/I reduction mediates H-2 evolution in a stepwise sequence. However, in aqueous media, outer-sphere reduction is not observed and H-2 evolution proceeds instead by concerted proton-electron transfer pathways typical of metal surfaces. Consequently, catalysis is not defined by the reduction potential of the parent molecule, but rather by the free energy of hydrogen binding. We attribute these mechanistic changes to electrostatic coupling between the molecule and the surface arising from adsorption.

Herein, a short-brush NiFeOxHy film with an edge-abundant, subcrystalline, and Ni3+-rich structure is designed and prepared on the Ni foam (NiFeOxHy/NF) and a trace amount of Pt is introduced to enhance the performance in water electrolysis. The short-brush NiFeOxHy film undergoes easier surface transformation than nanosheets to form an active NiFe(OOH)(x) phase during OER activation, as manifested by an overpotential of 204 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms conventional NiFeOxHy nanosheets. Additionally, the Pt-modified materials exhibit effective HER catalytical activity as well as high Pt mass-specific activity. The alkaline electrolyzer composed of the two electrodes requires only 1.54 V to obtain a current density 10 mA cm(-2) and the large potential is demonstrated.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000723626800001

Recent activities in the development of transition metal nitride electrocatalysts for this reaction have shown promise, but oxynitrides remain unexplored. We have performed a rigorous computational study of the highly promising vanadium oxynitride (VON) to establish for the first time the nitrogen reduction pathway in oxynitrides and the role of the mixed anions that can lead to improved stability of the active surface-states, activity, and selectivity over hydrogen evolution. The electrocatalytic properties are best enhanced at low oxygen content (12.5%) due to optimal balance between consecutive protonation preference at N-sites over V-sites, low onset potential (0.4 V-RHE), and facile N-2 adsorption at N-vacancy sites, while a higher oxygen containing VON (31.25%) shows the lowest N-2 adsorption/dissociation barrier (similar to 0.3 eV) on the anion vacancy and can also be a potential N2RR catalyst with a higher NH3 turn over frequency, albeit with a lower stability and higher overpotential (0.6 V-RHE) compared to x = 12.5%. The critical N-vacancy active sites are protected from self-annihilation by the mixed-valency anions, large kinetic barriers, and site blocking by O*/OH*/H* due to highly favorable N-2 absorption.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100036		
J	Gao, Rui; Yan, Dongpeng								Fast formation of single-unit-cell-thick and defect-rich layered double hydroxide nanosheets with highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting								NANO RESEARCH				11	4			1883	1894		10.1007/s12274-017-1806-x				APR 2018	2018	The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) plays an important role in the water-splitting process. Herein, we report a facile way to obtain two-dimensional (2D) single-unit-cell-thick layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets (NSs, similar to 1.3 nm) within only 5 min. These nanosheets presented significantly enhanced OER performance compared to bulk LDH systems fabricated using the conventional co-precipitation method. The current strategy further allowed control over the chemical compositions and electrochemical activities of the LDH NSs. For example, CoFe-LDH NSs presented the lowest overpotential of 0.28 V at 10 mA/cm(2), and the NiFe-LDHs NSs showed Tafel slopes of 33.4 mV/decade and nearly 100% faradaic efficiency, thus outperforming state-of-the-art IrO2 water electrolysis catalysts. Moreover, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations confirmed that rich defects and distorted lattices occurred within the 2D LDH NSs, which could supply abundant electrochemically active OER sites. Periodic calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) further showed that the CoFe- and NiFe-LDHs presented very low energy gaps and obvious spin-polarization behavior, which facilitated high electron mobility during the OER process. Therefore, this work presents a combined experimental and theoretical study on 2D single-unit-cell-thick LDH NSs with high OER activities, which have potential application in water splitting for renewable energy.									132	13	0	0	8	0	133			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000427907700012

The model was validated thanks to experiments performed on symmetrical cells using a three-electrode setup. After the model calibration on polarization curves, it has been shown that the model is able to simulate accurately the experimental impedance diagram at OCP and under polarization without additional fitting. Moreover, the evolution of the electrode polarization resistance with the oxygen partial pressure is well reproduced by the model. The electrodes reaction mechanism was thoroughly analyzed and it has been shown that the transition from the bulk path to the surface path depends on the temperature, the polarization and the oxygen partial pressure. The rate-determining steps for the LSCF electrode have been identified at OCP as function of the oxygen partial pressure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis has been performed to study the impact of LSCF demixing on the electrode performances. For a given decomposition, it has been highlighted that the surface passivation would be more impacting than the decrease of the ionic conductivity. Moreover, the impact of the LSCF decomposition would be more detrimental for the electrode performances evaluated in electrolysis mode. (c) 2021 The Electrochemical Society ("ECS").

FeCo alloy as an active-species usually suffers from its poor catalytic stability by easy corrosion. Here, we synthesize a core (FeCo)-shell (carbon) alloy anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon-nanosheets (FeCo/NUCSs) via a self-growth strategy. FeCo/NUCSs (140 m2 g-1) exhibits promising half-wave potential (E1/2 =0.89 V) and methanol tolerance for ORR. Prussian blue analog-derived carbon shell protects binary active-sites (Fe-Nx/Co-Nx) on FeCo core to stabilize ORR activity. FeCo/NUCSs also displays a higher OER activity (overpotential of 300 mV) than RuO2, due to generation of highly-active FeOOH/CoOOH species on FeCo alloys as indicated by in situ X-ray diffraction. Assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibits promising open-circuit voltage of 1.51 V, specific capacity of 791.86 mA h g-1, and durability (102 h). This novel bimetallic alloy-based catalyst provides an interesting option for design of durable oxygen-electrocatalysts for ZAB.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000826505800002

In this work, we successfully developed a facile route to synthesize graphene-like layered carbon (GLC) from a layered silicate template. The obtained GLC has layered structure similar to that of the template and can be used as support to load ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles on it in supercritical water. The specific structure and surface properties of GLC enable Ru nanoparticles to disperse highly uniformly on it even at a large loading amount (62 wt %). When the novel Ru/GLC was used as catalyst on a glass carbon electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, it exhibits an extremely low onset potential of only 3 mV and a small Tafel slope of 46 mV/decade. The outstanding performance proved that Ru/GLC is highly active catalyst for HER, comparable with transition-metal dichalcogenides or selenides. As the price of ruthenium is much lower than platinum, our study shows that Ru/GLC might be a promising candidate as an HER catalyst in future energy applications.									73	2	0	0	3	0	73			1944-8244			WOS:000391081700021	27966849

Based on a fundamental study about the substantial effect of a three-dimensional active site at a step on a highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite basal plane on the electrode reactions, we attempted to extend the idea to a graphitic carbon fiber surface as a more applied form for the air electrode. Coating of a carbonaceous thin film derived from iron phthalocyanine on finely-etched graphitic carbon fibers produced a highly step-enriched surface demonstrated by the field-emission scanning electron microscope image and Raman spectra with a developed defect peak. The iron K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure showed a step-oriented iron atom coordinated by two nitrogen atoms and a basal plane oriented iron atom coordinated by 4 nitrogen atoms. The step-enrichment enhanced the oxygen reduction and evolution; in particular, the low overpotential phenomenon observed for the fundamental graphite system was reproduced in the carbon fiber paper, both in a half cell and a full cell of the zinc-air battery, which also showed a favorable cycling performance.

The structure and morphologies of the oxide films were determined by XRD and SEM, respectively. Linear Sweep Voltammetry, Tafel Plot and Cyclic Voltammetry were used to characterize their electrochemical activities of oxygen evolution. Test results show that the iridium and tantalum could form solid solution structure. The mutual solubility between iridium and tantalum is affected by the ratio of Ir/Ta in coating solution and influences the dimension parameters of IrO2 crystals. The finer IrO2 crystallites increase on the coating surface and the electrocatalytic capability of oxygen evolution is strengthened with the increasing of IrO2 content in the coatings. When the content of IrO2 is too high, the coating adhesion and rigidity would decrease which affect electrochemical activity of the anode. The electrochemically active surface area is determined not only by the content of IrO2, but also the structure and morphology of the anode coatings. It is probably due to the existence of proper quantities of inert Ta2O5, resulting in a typical morphology of cracks and solid solution structure. The solid solution structure is helpful to prolong the anode service life. The morphology of cracks could perhaps improve the anode active surface area and the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution.									4	16	0	0	0	0	18			1002-185X			WOS:000244993600013

While many reports have activated OER electrocatalysts using either CP or CV, the inherent differences between these two electrochemical conditioning methods for the activation of OER electrocatalytic materials have yet to be explored. Here, we investigate the effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on a Ni-based OER precatalyst and substrate in Fe-purified and Fe-unpurified KOH electrolytes by employing (i) Ni foil, (ii) NiSe precatalyst films with different thicknesses on the fluorine-doped tin oxide glass substrate, and (iii) NiSe precatalyst films on Ni foil substrates. It was found that CV electrochemical conditioning can result in a higher degree of in situ oxidation and Fe incorporation for Ni-based precatalysts and substrates compared to CP electrochemical conditioning. In turn, this brought about different material properties (e.g., in situ oxidized layer thickness, composition, crystallinity, and morphology) and electrochemical characteristics (e.g., active surface area, electron transport limitation, and intrinsic activity) of Ni-based electrocatalysts, thereby not only affecting their OER activity but also complicating the interpretation of the origin of OER activity. This study identifies the distinct effects of CP and CV electrochemical conditioning on Ni-based OER electrocatalysts and provides insight into the choice of the electrochemical conditioning method to better investigate OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000843603300001

Herein, we report the use of oxygen vacancy rich TiO2 loaded with Au nanoparticles as NRR catalyst in super concentrated lithium bis(tri-fluoromethane sulfonyl) imide (Li TFSI) "water-in-salt " system (20 M electrolyte) and obtain the Faradaic efficiency of 37.2 % with an NH3 yield rate of 20.3 mu g h(-1) cm(-2) at -0.4 V vs RHE, accompanied by the significant decay of both current density and onset potential of hydrogen evolution reaction. Electrochemical experimental and theoretical calculation results indicate that the HER process can be greatly hindered both kinetically and energetically. The unique effect of this "water-in-salt " electrolyte would offer a new idea to improve the NRR selectivity via HER suppression.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000861041200001

This study emphasizes, the defects creation and structural evolution comprised due to N-F co-doping on graphitic carbon nanofibers (GNFs) of different morphologies, viz. GNF-linearly aligned platelets (L), antlers (A), herringbone (H), and their specific interaction with Pt nanoparticle in enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). GNFs-NF-Pt catalysts exhibit better ORR electrocatalytic activity, superior durability that is solely ascribed to the morphological evolution and the doped N-F heteroatoms, prompting the charge density variations in the resultant carbon fiber matrices. Amongst, H-NF-Pt catalyst performed outstanding ORR activity with exceptional electrochemical stability, which shows only 20 mV loss in the half-wave potential whilst 100 mV loss for Pt/C catalyst on 20,000 potential cycling. The PEMFC comprising H-NF-Pt as cathode catalyst with minimum loading of 0.10 mg cm(-2), delivers power density of 0.942 W cm(-2) at current density of 2.50 A cm(-2) without backpressures in H-2 -O-2 feeds. The H-NF-Pt catalyst owing to its hierarchical architectures, performs well in PEMFC at the minimized catalyst loading with outstanding stability that can significantly decrease total price for the fuel cell.

Journal of colloid and interface science				630	Pt A			257	265		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.09.137				2022-Sep-30	2022	Enriching the active sites and enhancing the intrinsic activity of a single site are two basic strategies for improving the activity toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and designing an advanced microstructure with a boosted pre-oxidation process can further guarantee durability toward long-term catalysis. Herein, we propose a dual oxidation strategy of a Co Prussian blue analog (Co PBA), which simultaneously achieves Co3+ active site enrichment, in situ CeO2 decoration and lattice disordering with abundant undercoordinated sites, realizing highly efficient and ultrastable OER performance. The dual oxidation process can induce the enrichment of high-valence Co ions by combined chemical oxidation and d-f electron coupling compared to the singly oxidized catalysts, thereby providing more active sites with enhanced intrinsic activity for the early triggered OER process. In addition, the disordered lattice can provide abundant reactive Co sites for the pre-oxidation process, thereby leading to obvious activation of the catalysts and remarkable operational stability due to the substantially accumulated Co3+ sites. Benefitting from the structural advantages of lattice-disordered dual-oxidized Co PBA nanocages, a low overpotential of 240mV can be achieved for a 10mAcm-2 current density, and the large catalytic current density and intrinsic activity are among the best compared to those of previously reported PBA-based and PBA-derived catalysts and even RuO2 and IrO2. In addition, ultrastable OER behavior with a 263% activity enhancement in 150h can result, making the dual-oxidized catalyst a promising candidate for water electrolysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:36242885	36242885

The obtained nanoarchitecture delivers an overpotential of 318 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 46.1 mV dec(-1). This activity is superior to most reported oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, and even much better than those of Ir- and Ru-based ones measured under the same conditions (0.1 M KOH). Additionally, this electrode undergoes negligible potential and current change after 19.8 h chronopotentiometric measurement and 300 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The outstanding catalytic performance is mainly attributed to the ultrasmall and high-density CoO NPs embedded in Ndoped carbon uniformly assembled on the 3-D substrate significantly increasing electrochemically accessible active sites and durability and the N-doped carbon greatly promoting intrinsic activity of CoO. This work not only creates 3-D highly tunable networked nanostructured electrodes with excellent durability for high-efficiency electrocatalysis but also develops a facile, economical, and extremely versatile strategy to controllably self-assemble conformal MOC-based multilayers with multifunctionality and superior performance on essentially any substrate at the molecular level for broad applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000595546500091

In this study, we fabricated, evaluated, and presented such a high-performance catalyst which is the Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies that can efficiently catalyze water splitting in neutral and alkaline media. A hierarchical nano assembly of Ni3Se4 was fabricated by functionalizing the surface-cleaned Ni foam using NaHSe solution as the Se source with the assistance of microwave irradiation (300 W) for 3 min followed by 5 h of aging at room temperature (RT). The fabricated Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies were subjected to catalyze water electrolysis in neutral and alkaline media. For a defined current density of SO mA cm(-2), the Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies required very low overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), viz., 232, 244, and 321 mV at pH 14.5, 14.0, and 13.0 respectively. The associated lower Tafel slope values (33, 30, and 40 mV dec(-1)) indicate the faster OER kinetics on Ni3Se4 surfaces in alkaline media. Similarly, in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), for a defined current density of 50 mA cm(-2), the Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies required low overpotentials of 211, 206, and 220 mV at pH 14.5, 14.0, and 13.0 respectively. The Tafel slopes for HER at pH 14.5, 14.0, and 13.0 are 165, 156, and 128 mV dec(-1), respectively. A comparative study on both OER and HER was carried out with the state-ofthe-art RuO2 and Pt under identical experimental conditions, the results of which revealed that our Ni3Se4 is a far better highperformance catalyst for water splitting. Besides, the efficiency of Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies in catalyzing water splitting in neutral solution was carried out, and the results are better than many previous reports. With these amazing advantages in fabrication method and in catalyzing water splitting at various pH, the Ni3Se4 nanoassemblies can be an efficient, cheaper, nonprecious, and high-performance electrode for water electrolysis with low overpotentials.									101	1	0	0	3	0	101			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000396801200031	28215087

During the past few years, the ORR catalytic activity of nitrogen-doped carbons has been significantly increased, making them highly competitive alternatives to conventional precious metals based electrocatalysts for ORR. However, controversies remain in the unambiguous identification of the ORR active sites on nitrogen-doped carbons. This review summarizes the recent progress in probing the potential active sites on metal-free nitrogen-doped carbons for ORR, aiming to gain in-depth understanding of the ORR catalytic mechanism on nitrogen-doped carbons for further enhancing ORR activity.									45	1	0	0	1	0	44				2073-4344		WOS:000451150200025

Kinetic model for parallel reactions of the CaSO4 oxygen carrier with CO in a CLC process is explored in this paper. Tests on an isothermal reaction were carried out in a Thermogravimetric Analyzer coupled with Fourier Transform Infrared spectrum (TGA-FTIR), and the instantaneous evolutions of SO2, and COS were monitored by the FTIR quantitative analysis. The reaction temperature was varied between 850 and 1050 degrees C, while 5-28% CO concentrations were utilized. The experiments showed that the reduction of CaSO4 by CO was a complex process, with the products of either sole CaS or both CaS and CaO depending on the reaction temperature as well as the concentration of CO reactant. The parallel reactions of CaSO4 with CO were investigated in terms of the selectivity based on the nucleation and growth model under isothermal conditions. According to the fitting results, the nucleation and growth model fit well the conversion-time data, and some of the kinetic parameters were obtained.									22	2	0	0	1	1	23			0888-5885			WOS:000289764000050

Whereas AIROF displays the characteristics of a semiconducting electrode in its reduced state, hlrO(2) is similar to a metal electrode. In view of also significant differences between the two oxides' optical and intercalation properties, this strongly indicates that hIrO(2) has a different bulk electronic structure. Yet, the charge-normalised electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen-evolution reaction at AIROF and hIrO(2) is the same. This indicates that the electrocatalytic properties of iridium oxide are a function of the local structure at the oxide surface and not uniquely related to the bulk electronic structure.

Very few studies have been performed to understand oxygen evolution reaction (OER) behavior by optimizing the individual factors that influence performance. This study highlights the effects of catalyst loading, catalyst selection, porous transport layer (PTL) type and conductive additive content. The influence of each factor is elucidated through a design of experiments (DoE) approach with a full statistical analysis. Electrochemical data, alongside Pareto charts, parametric trends and their mutual interactions are discussed. This DoE approach is also helpful in making useful predictions and discovering new combinations to be tested. The end result was a high-performance AEMEL able to operate at a current density of 1.0 A/cm(2) at 1.80 V with IrOx OER and PtNi hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts using 0.3 M KOH fed to the anode. Even lower operating voltage was observed with PbRuOx catalyst at the anode, 1.64 V @ 1.0 A/cm(2), though the cell decay rate was higher. Lastly, a IrOx/PtNi cell was stably operated continuously for 30 days (720 h) at 1.0 A/cm(2). This study can serve as a guide for optimal electrode design with insights into component-performance compromises, which can aid in making design choices and performing techno-economic analyses.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000788161100003

We have tried to highlight this influence by taking the Bi-Fe-O system for the study. Herein, we have synthesized three structures of the Bi-Fe-O system viz. BiFeO3 (perovskite structure), Bi2Fe4O9 (mullite structure), and Bi25FeO40 (sillenite structure) as an example to establish the relation. These oxides were characterized by Rietveld refinement for structure and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology. Their optical and magnetic properties were also investigated. Systematic studies were carried out with both as-synthesized and electrically polarized oxides for their performance towards OER. We observed that the order for OER activity (using non-polarized catalyst) of the three stable structures synthesized was Bi2Fe4O9 > BiFeO3 > Bi25FeO40, which was attributed to the presence of Fe(oct)-O-Fe(td) linkages in Bi2Fe4O9. While the current density of Bi2Fe4O9 and BiFeO3 remained unchanged after poling, that of Bi(25)FeO(4)0 increased by four-fold. From the study, we have demonstrated that proper choice of the crystal structure and utilization of electrical polarization can be effective strategies to manipulate the surfaces of an electrocatalytic material.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process in such conversions, having applications in water splitting and metal-air batteries. Here, we report ultrathin metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline conditions. Our as-prepared ultrathin NiCo bimetal-organic framework nanosheets on glassy-carbon electrodes require an overpotential of 250 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When the MOF nanosheets are loaded on copper foam, this decreases to 189 mV. We propose that the surface atoms in the ultrathin MOF sheets are coordinatively unsaturated-that is, they have open sites for adsorption-as evidenced by a suite of measurements, including X-ray spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations. The findings suggest that the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms are the dominating active centres and the coupling effect between Ni and Co metals is crucial for tuning the electrocatalytic activity.									1349	81	0	0	81	0	1364			2058-7546			WOS:000394793800001

The growth of high-index facets results in a 3-5 fold enhancement of O-2 evolution from photocatalytic water splitting by the BiVO4 polyhedron, relative to its low-index counterparts. Theory calculations reveal that water dissociation is more energetically favorable on the high-index surfaces than on the low-index (010), (110), and (101) surfaces, which is accompanied by a notable reduction in the overpotential (0.77-1.14 V) for the oxygen evolution reaction. The apparent quantum efficiency of O-2 generation without an external electron supply reaches 18.3% under 430 nm light irradiation, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of the catalysts reported hitherto.									132	5	0	0	7	0	132			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000419033700005	29178291

Herein, a facile and scalable strategy, namely, dealloying, is advanced to fabricate mesoporous ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) containing Co, Ni, and Fe for highly efficient oxygen evolution and overall water splitting, based upon elaborate design of precursors and accurate control of the dealloying process. The Co1Ni2Fe1-LDH exhibits remarkable catalytic properties toward oxygen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH, for instance low overpotentials (only requires 240.4 mV on glass carbon electrode, and 228.5 mV on Ni foam to drive 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (38.6 mV dec(-1)), as well as excellent stability (lasts 45 h for 10 mA cm(-2) without deactivation). Surprisingly, a symmetric alkaline electrolyzer constructed with Co1Ni2Fe1-LDH serving as the catalyst for both cathode and anode requires only 1.65 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2). The distinguished features of the catalysts lie in the combined effects of the unique LDH structure with large interlayer spaces, the 3D porous structure, and the synergistic interplay of the metal species, concurrently contributing to the fully exposed active sites, accelerated electrolyte penetration and charge/ion transfer, as well as the well-promoted reaction kinetics. The consolidation of the electrocatalytic merits and the facile, economical fabrication route endows the ternary CoNiFe-LDHs as promising catalysts for the generation of renewable energy resources.									47	1	0	0	3	0	47			2168-0485			WOS:000452344900023

A solid polymer electrolyte cell was fabricated using perforated current collectors, composed of PGEA pressed against the solid polymer electrolyte using a stainless steel fine mesh as the cathode. Ex situ characterization carried out through XRD and SEM techniques provided information about the structural and morphological properties of the MF-PbO2, respectively. An electrochemical characterization study was carried out through analysis of the quasi-stationary polarization curves obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Analysis of SEM images showed that the MF-PbO2 surface is rough and uniformly distributed along fibers of the carbon cloth substrate. The formation of MF-PbO2 occurred preferentially onto carbon fibers located near the surface of the substrate (outer fibers). The XRD study revealed a high degree of crystallinity of the beta phase (beta-PbO2), with crystals characterized by a size of 24 nm. Analysis of the Tafel plot permitted us to propose the primary water discharge as the rate-determining step for the OER. The apparent enthalpy and entropy of activation and the apparent kinetic rate constant were evaluated for the OER on MF-PbO2. The endurance test revealed that MF-PbO2 are resistant to wear during the intense oxygen evolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of nickel hydrides in the potential region of the her was previously analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and the electrode surface was pre-conditioned to minimize the effect of the hydrides in the experimental response of the system. Data from polarization curves was conveniently analyzed by non-linear regression fitting resulting in a Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism in which the second reaction must be the rds to explain the characteristics of the hydride formation. The calculated value of the rate constant for the electrochemical desorption step was 1.65 x 10(-11) mol cm2 s-1 at 25-degrees-C. The apparent energy of activation was 58 kJ mol-1, a value somewhat higher than those in the literature and that was justified in terms of the specific pre-treatment of the surface. A voltammetric method for determining the real electrochemical active area of Ni electrodes is also described.									181	1	0	0	6	0	182			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:A1994NU81000005

However, the existence and instability of these holes challenge the activity and stability of the semiconductor catalysts. In this work, we demonstrate a molten salt homogeneous doping method of non-metallic doping involving double doping, on the surface and bulk phase of the catalyst, thereby NiOx/B-TiO2@CdS core-shell nanowires achieving high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity. The double doping function of the homogeneous method is realized by the fact that B2O3 acts as both molten salt and doping precursor. The dual-doping of B reduced exciton binding energies and improves the stability and density of oxide vacancies resulting in high light utilization rate. The results showed that the oxygen vacancy density of the catalyst remained at 83.3% after 10 h of reaction. In addition, the construction of a heterojunction enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, and the loading of group catalyst reduces the activation energy of reaction, thus improving the catalytic efficiency of the catalyst. As a result, the photocatalytic performance of the B-TiO2@CdS core-shell structure photocatalyst is significantly better than that of bare CdS. The H-2 evolution rate is increased to 8.11 mmol/g with NiOx/B-TiO2@CdS, which is 5.7 times greater than CdS (1.42 mmol/g). The research furnishes a new strategy for the design of stable oxygen vacancies within heterojunction-based photocatalysts to produce H-2 from photocatalytic water splitting.[GRAPHIC]									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000833456400002

The exploration of cost-effective alternative electrocatalysts with the ability to drive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is extremely significant to promote overall water splitting. Herein, ultrathin CoSe2/CNTs nanocomposites have been synthesized by a facile two-step method, where the ultrathin Co-MOF (metal organic-framework) decorated with cable-like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) (Co-MOF/CNTs) was initially fabricated, and followed a low-temperature selenization process. The ultrathin CoSe2 nanosheets as well as the superior conductivity of CNTs synergistically resulted in abundant active sites and enhanced conductivity to boost the electrocatalytic activity. The as-prepared CoSe2/CNTs electrocatalysts exhibited an overpotential of 190 mV and 300 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for the HER and OER in alkaline solution, respectively, and demonstrated superior durability. Furthermore, the as-prepared bifunctional CoSe2/CNTs electrocatalysts can act as cathode and anode in an electrolyzer, showing a cell voltage of 1.75 V at 10 mA/cm(2) for overall water splitting.

The reaction requires free radical chemistry. Three quite different classes of ribonucleotide reductases are known today. All three are proteins containing a stable free radical amino acid, but each uses a different mechanism for its generation. Did they evolve from a common ancestor, with the arrival of atmospheric oxygen providing the driving force for their divergence, or was each a separate evolutionary invention?.									78	1	0	0	70	0	82			0968-0004	1362-4326		WOS:A1997WM12900003	9066257

However, Nb has been used as a support in the form of oxides in all previously reported Pt-Nb electrocatalysts, and no Pt-Nb alloying phase has been demonstrated hitherto. Herein, we report a multifunctional Pt-Nb composite (PtNb/NbOx-C) where Nb exists both as an alloying component with Pt and as an oxide support and is synthesized by means of a simple wet chemical method. In this work, the Pt-Nb alloy phase has been firmly verified with the help of multiple spectroscopic methods. This allows for the experimental evidence of the theoretical prediction that Pt-Nb alloy interactions improve the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt. In addition, such a combination of multiphase Nb brings up myriad features encompassing increased ORR durability, immunity to phosphate anion poisoning, enhanced hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) activity, and oxidative carbon monoxide (CO) stripping, making this electrocatalyst useful in multiple fuel cell systems.									41	1	0	0	0	0	41			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100004

Herein, Cu doped Co3O4 porous nanosheet arrays were synthesized on three-dimensional (3D) nickel foam (Cu-Co3O4 NAs/NF) by a facile pyrolysis process of bimetal-organic frameworks precursors. The systematic experiments evidence that the Cu doping in Co3O4 materials not only results in affluent trivalent cobalt as active sites for OER electrocatalysis, but also modulates the nanosheet morphology to achieve high specific surface area and well-exposed active sites. Moreover, the 3D electrode configuration simultaneously offers open-channels for electron transport and gas products release. Benefitting from the exotic geometric and electronic structure, the engineered Cu-Co3O4 NAs/NF electrode exhibits outstanding activity (an overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term durability toward OER, much better than the benchmark IrO2/NF. Together with its remarkable HER activity, our Cu-Co3O4 NAs/NF electrode enables a low voltage of 1.58 V to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting, which is comparable to those of current Co-based bifunctional electrocatalysts. This work may open up opportunities to explore other advanced electrocatalysts with high valence Co3+ and 3D porous architectures for scale-up water electrolysis.									20	1	0	0	0	0	21			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000481207100001

Although a detailed study of the bulk electronic structure-activity relationship towards oxygen evolution on these oxides has been reported, the influence of carbon on the behavior of these oxides as OER catalysts is not yet clearly understood. In the present work we study the influence of functionalized acetylene black (AB(f)) carbon in the electrode composition on the OER activity for perovskite oxides using the thin-film rotating disk electrode technique. It was found that the addition of AB(f) significantly enhances the OER activity of the single perovskite oxides, namely Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, (BSCF) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF). The activity of the double perovskite oxide, (Pr0.5Ba0.5)CoO3-delta (PBCO), was relatively unaffected by the addition of AB(f) in the electrode. Ex situ impedance spectroscopy measurements at room temperature showed that BSCF powder displayed a lower resistivity compared to PBCO with LSCF displaying the highest resistivity of the three materials. These results therefore suggest that the AB(f) present can more than simply improve the conductive pathway in the perovskite/carbon composite electrodes but can also significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of selected perovskites towards the OER.

The alpha-MnO2 is widely used in rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). However, its performance gradually deteriorates upon charge-discharge cycling. Thus, its deactivation mechanisms must be understood to tackle such an issue. Herein, the deactivation mechanisms of MnO2 are duly investigated via the density functional theory-based analysis, where the MnO2 electrocatalysts are modeled based on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of the fresh MnO2 dominated by the alpha-MnO2 (211) and the spent one dominated by the beta-MnO2 (110). Based on the simulated event of ORR, the *OOH species exhibited the strongest chemisorption to all of the surfaces, followed in order by *O and *OH, respectively. Regarding the surface distortion due to the species presented during ORR, it was investigated by the Bader charge and charge density difference analysis. It was found that all surface experienced some degrees of distortion confirmed by the calculated strain value, where the most distorted surface is the deactivated MnO2, the beta-MnO2 (110). As the MnO2 phase transformation from a to beta during ORR generates a less active surface, the low activity found on beta-MnO2 (110) confirmed by the ORR overpotential (eta) derived from its Gibbs free energy diagram is due to the limiting elementary step converting *OOH to *O, which blocks the propagation towards the final product. While the OER performance for the fresh and spent catalysts are similar. Hence, the deactivation of the MnO2 electrocatalyst occurring during ORR is due to (1) the phase change from alpha-MnO2 to beta-MnO2 and (2) the limiting reaction, which leads to the formation of *OOH species rather than the H2O product. As a design guideline, the prevention of phase transformation is one of the key factors towards highperformance MnO2-based ORR/OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Oxide-based catalysts, especially perovskites (ABO(3)), ruddlesden-popper perovskite (A(2)BO(4)) and pyrochlore-type oxides (A(2)B(2)O(7)), have attracted gotten much interest as electrocatalysts for water splitting because of their distinctive physical, chemical, and electronic properties. In this work, a scientometric analysis is conducted on developing various oxide-based catalysts for water splitting to explore further developments. Up to now, a total of 29,761 publications (between the years 1990-2020) have been obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) website by searching for these written documents on this subject with a variety of linking keywords. The derived documents were subjected to a scientometric study, which included a look at the contributing authors, publications, contributing countries, top citation bursts, and topic categories. Based on the information obtained, in this research area, the publications started to increase dramatically since 2012.

The exfoliated MXenes possess rich defects/vacancies and surface oxygen groups, can be favorably utilized to anchor SAs. Here, we take advantage of the exfoliated Ti3C2Tx to anchor Ru-SAs on Ti3C2Tx through a wet-chemistry impregnation process. The obtained Ru-SA@Ti3C2Tx possesses excellent HER activity, especially under high current densities. Remarkably, Ru-SA@Ti3C2Tx can readily attain high current densities of 1 and 1.5 A cm(-2) at low over potentials of 425.7 and 464.6 mV, respectively, demonstrating its potential for practical applications. The A(1g) vibration frequency shift of the Raman spectrum is innovatively used to probe the surface -OH coverage on Ti3C2Tx, providing critical information for mechanistic studies. The experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the superior HER electrocatalytic activity of Ru-SA@Ti3C2Tx results from the Ru-SAs enhanced H2O adsorption and dissociation, and promoted H-2 formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000847913500001

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				124	43			23690	23698		10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c06750				OCT 29 2020	2020	Metal-supported hexagonal boron nitride monolayers (h-BN/M) are emerging as new potential electrocatalysts for various energy-related oxidation or reduction process. So far, several preparation methods have been developed to introduce, in a controlled way, defects such as vacancies or substitutional heteroatoms. Herein, we investigate by dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, defective and metal-doped h-BN/Cu(111) systems as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By calculating the hydrogen binding energy (Delta G(*H)) at different coverage conditions, we observe how the interaction between the defective/metal-doped h-BN layer and the Cu(111) substrate plays a key role in tuning the reactivity, leading to a thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption step (i.e., Delta G(*H) approximate to 0). These results could be generalized to other h-BN/M interfaces and may help their rational design for an improved H-2-evolving electrocatalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000587720300024

Three-dimensional (3D) multibranched PtIrCo alloyed nanowires (MBNWs) with rough surfaces were prepared by using glucose and oleylamine (OAm) as the co-reducing agents in an oil bath, in which cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) behaved as a structure-directing agent. Benefiting from the unique structures, strong electronic interactions and synergistic impacts of the trimetals, the as-fabricated PtIrCo MBNWs exhibited superior HER performance with an overpotential (eta) of 24.7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 45.67 mV dec(-1), and the exchange current density (j(0)) of 3.20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, surpassing that of commercial Pt/C catalyst.

Due to the synergistic effect between the sandwich-like structures and anion-doping, CoTe2xSe2(1-x) and CoS2ySe2(1-y) demonstrated attractive catalytic performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. After optimizing the composition, we found that sandwich-like Co(Te0.33Se0.67)(2) possesses optimal OER properties, with a low Tafel slope (44 mV dec(-1)), a small (10) (272 mV) and eminent stability for 50 h; meanwhile, the Co(S0.72Se0.28)(2) catalyst presents attractive HER performance, featuring a minimum Tafel slope (80 mV dec(-1)) and a low (10) (106 mV) in alkaline media. Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that G(H*) of the Co(S0.72Se0.28)(2) catalyst (0.182 eV) is closest to zero. Therefore, an alkaline electrolyzer was fabricated using Co(Te0.33Se0.67)(2) as the anode and Co(S0.72Se0.28)(2) as the cathode; it manifested striking catalytic activity and favorable stability for overall water splitting. This is the first time that the effects of different dopants (Te and S atoms) and doping contents on the electrocatalytic performance of CoSe2 were explored towards overall water splitting.

However, a major challenge is to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the anodic half-cell reaction where oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place. Here, a seamlessly conductive 3D architecture is reported with a carbon-shelled Ni-Co nanowire network as a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst. Highly porous and granular Ni-Co nanowires are first grown on a carbon fiber woven fabric utilizing a cost-effective hydrothermal method and then conductive carbon shell is coated on the Ni-Co nanowires via glucose carbonization and annealing processes. The conductive carbon layer surrounding the nanowires is introduced to provide a continuous pathway for facile electron transport throughout the whole of the integrated 3D catalyst. This 3D hierarchical structure provides several synergistic effects and beneficial functions including a large number of active sites, easy accessibility of water, fast electron transport, rapid release of oxygen gas, enhanced electrochemical durability, and stronger structural integrity, resulting in a remarkable OER activity that delivers an overpotential of 302 mV with a Tafel slope of 43.6 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium electrolyte (1 m KOH).									235	4	0	0	9	0	236			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000393583600005

Herein, we reported a superhydrophilic and underwater superaerophobic multistage layered micro-nano structure of Co9S8-Ni3S2-CNTOF on nickel foam (NF) prepared by a simple one-step hydrothermal procedure. Particularly, the multistage layered micro-nano structure makes the electrode superhydrophilic and superaerophobic, which can facilitate the exposure of active sites, accelerate the tansfer of electrolyte and the release of gas bubbles. Consequently, the rough electrode demonstrated excellent catalytic performance in alkaline condition, which only need a low overpotential 127 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 243 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2) and can keep a long durability for 10 hat 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the production of hydrogen in an electrolytic water device with Co9S8-Ni3S2-CNTOF as bifunctional electrode prowered by the electricity derived from solar and wind energy in laboratory condition was artificially simulated. This work represents a perspective in improving the electrocatalytic performance of water splitting by structure and wettability regulation and opens a new avenue for clean energy generation.

Nevertheless, the catalytic efficiency of the reported antimonene catalysts has been limited by their poor conductivity and low-density of exposed active sites. Herein, the active edge sites engineering is adopted to expose abundant catalytically active edge sites by decreasing the size of antimonene nanosheets to ultrasmall-sized antimonene nanodots (AMNDs). Meanwhile, the synergy effect of the surface modulation strategy by decorating the base surface of AMNDs using the ionic liquid benefits the mass transfer during the HER process. Impressively, the ionic liquid modified AMNDs (noted as IL-AMNDs) achieve a low overpotential of 116 mV at the current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and excellent long-term durability, even superior to many other previously reported 2D catalysts. This work spreads the way out for the development of highly active and efficient hydrogen production catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000750175700001

Here, 3d transition metal layered double hydroxides (LDHs) with varied contents of Ni and Fe were successfully synthesized through a homogeneous precipitation. The exfoliated NiFe LDH nanosheets were heteroassembled with graphene oxide (GO) as well as reduced graphene oxide (rGO) into superlattice-like hybrids, in which two kinds of oppositely charged nanosheets are stacked face-to-face in alternating sequence. Heterostructured composites of Ni2/3Fe1/3 LDH nanosheets and GO (Ni2/3Fe1/3-GO) exhibited an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency with a small overpotential of about 0.23 V and Tafel slope of 42 mV/decade. The activity was further improved via the combination of Ni2/3Fe1/3 LDH nanosheets with more conductive rGO (Ni2/3Fe1/3-rGO) to achieve an overpotential as low as 0.21 V and Tafel plot of 40 mV/decade. The catalytic activity was enhanced with an increased Fe content in the bimetallic NiFe system. Moreover, the composite catalysts were found to be effective for hydrogen evolution reaction. An electrolyzer cell powered by a single AA battery of 1.5 V was demonstrated by using the bifunctional catalysts.									538	39	0	0	30	0	546			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000349940500094	25605063

Herein, novel iron tungsten sulfideheterojunction nanosheets (FexSy/WS2Ns) with a petal-like structure wereprepared by a facile hydrothermal method. The prepared petal-like FexSy/WS2Nsowned a large diameter size of similar to 1 mu m and a thickness of 8 nm for eachflake. Thedeveloped FexSy/WS2Ns exhibited excellent HER activity with an overpotential of118 mV at 10 mA cm-2and a low Tafel slope of 87 mV dec-1in 0.5 M H2SO4,which is much better than that of single FexSyand WS2(>420 mV at 10 mAcm-2). This advanced HER activity is owed to the unique thin structure and moreexposed active sites provided by defects between the crystal interface of FexSyandWS2. Furthermore, the FexSy/WS2Ns as a bifunctional electrocatalyst couldachieve energy-saving water-splitting by replacing the oxygen evolution reactionwith the urea oxidation reaction to decrease the applied voltage to 147 mV									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000799358500021

The photocatalytic water splitting reaction which directly converts solar energy into H-2 is an appreciated alternative, among which, the thermodynamic constraint and slow reaction kinetics are critical factors for developing efficient semiconductor-based photocatalysts. Here, we report an amino group (-NH2) functionalized ultrathin two-dimensional (2D) graphitic carbon nitride (2D CN-NH2) with strong redox capability and accelerated photocatalytic reaction kinetics. Specifically, the ultrathin 2D structure improves the transfer and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charge carriers and increases the band gap of 2D CN-NH2. -NH2 functions as a photogenerated hole stabilizer, which can prolong the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers. Additionally, the Lewis basicity supplied by -NH2 can further boost the photocatalytic performance of 2D CN-NH2. The apparent quantum yield of the obtained 2D CN-NH2 reaches similar to 13.4% at 420 nm.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000520021200087
