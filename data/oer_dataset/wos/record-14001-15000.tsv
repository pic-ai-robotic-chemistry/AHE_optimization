Splitting water electrochemically is among the most used techniques, however, it accounts for only 4% of global hydrogen production. One of the reasons is the high cost and low performance of catalysts promoting the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, we report a highly efficient catalyst in acid, that is, solid-solution RuIr nanosized-coral (RuIr-NC) consisting of 3 nm-thick sheets with only 6at.% Ir. Among OER catalysts, RuIr-NC shows the highest intrinsic activity and stability. A home-made overall water splitting cell using RuIr-NC as both electrodes can reach 10mAcm(geo)(-2) at 1.485V for 120h without noticeable degradation, which outperforms known cells. Operando spectroscopy and atomic-resolution electron microscopy indicate that the high-performance results from the ability of the preferentially exposed {0001} facets to resist the formation of dissolvable metal oxides and to transform ephemeral Ru into a long-lived catalyst. Ru is one of the most active metals for oxygen evolution reaction, but it quickly dissolves in acidic electrolyte particularly in nanosized form. Here, the authors show that coral-like solid-solution RuIr consisting of 3 nm-thick sheets with only 6 at% Ir is a long-lived catalyst with high activity.									43	2	0	0	3	0	43				2041-1723		WOS:000626757600001	33594054

In the present study, an engineering process was employed to prepare "Lewis base-hungry" amorphous-crystalline nickel borate-nickel sulfide (Ni-3(BO3)(2)-Ni3S2) heterostructures, which exhibited unprecedentedly high electrocatalytic activity toward both OER and HER in alkaline media. The optimal Ni-3(BO3)(2)-Ni3S2/nickel foam (Ni-3(BO3)(2)-Ni3S2/NF) electrode displayed an ultralow overpotential of only -92 and +217 mV to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. When the Ni-3(BO3)(2)-Ni3S2/NF electrode was used as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.49 V was needed to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was superior to the performance of most noble metal-free electrocatalysts. Results from density functional theory calculations showed that the Lewis base-hungry sites in the heterostructures effectively enhanced the chemisorption of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates, a critical step in HER and OER electrocatalysis. Results from this study highlight the significance of rational design and engineering of heterostructured materials for the development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.									34	0	0	0	3	0	34			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000537731900025	32362112

Herein, a facile template-free co-precipitation route was reported for the design and fabrication of well-ordered NiCo2O4 (NCO) spinel nanowire arrays. The as-prepared NCO spinel nanowire arrays are characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, BET and XPS. BET results show that NCO spinel nanowire arrays have a mesoporous (ca. 8 nm) structure and a high specific surface area of 124 m(2) g(-1). The catalytic activity of NCO spinel nanowire arrays for the ORR and the OER in 0.1 M KOH solution has been studied by using a rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. RRDE results show that the NCO spinel nanowire array catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the ORR. The ORR mainly favors a direct four electron pathway, which is close to the behavior of the Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on carbon) electrocatalyst under the same testing conditions. Anodic linear scanning voltammogram results show that the NCO spinel nanowire array catalyst is more active for the OER. The chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammogram tests show that the NCO spinel nanowire array catalyst exhibits excellent stability and reversibility for the ORR and the OER.									270	16	0	0	7	0	275			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000324553400022

We used ab initio computational methods to show that the biaxial strain on [100]-oriented orthorhombic NaTaO3 thin films grants the modulation of surface states, favoring either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which basically rules the perovskite photocatalytic performance. Under compression, the outermost TaO6 and TaO4 polyhedra become more distorted, and electrostatic repulsion increases the energy of Ta 5d surface states. As they overcome the O-2/H2O potential, they cease to contribute to the OER. At the same time, the H+/H-2 remains below the conduction band, leveraging the HER over the OER. The tensile strain lowers the outermost polyhedra distortions, stabilizing both Ta 5d surface and conduction band states, and increasing the charge centered around surface Ta atoms. Consequently, the bands are better aligned with O-2/H2O and H+/H-2 potentials, which benefits the overall water splitting photocatalysis. Our results evidence that combining facet and strain engineering is an effective way of altering the photocatalytic activity of orthorhombic [100] NaTaO3 thin films.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000582937400032	33064116

Unfortunately, the catalytic activity of Mo2C is lower than that of Pt, and it needs to be substantially improved for practical applications. It is necessary and urgent to consider the effect of synergetic interactions among defects, functions, and strain on the HER activity. In this study, the geometric structures, electronic properties, and the HER activity of the Mo2C monolayer, with vacancy defects (i.e. Mo and C), oxygen functionalization, and strain, are studied by using first-principles calculations. According to our results, the combination of Mo vacancies, which can be obtained under C-rich conditions, and oxygen functionalization is the most effective way to improve the HER activity of 1T- and 2H-Mo2C. Considering the abundant active sites and optimal Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption, the 1T phase we obtained shows excellent HER activity even at high H coverage and improves the utilization of active sites, for which the HER activity is comparable to that of Pt. This can be attributed to the fact that oxygen atoms gain more electrons from Mo2C, which weakens the strength of the O-H bond. Our work provides not only an opportunity to better understand the catalytic mechanism, but also a guide to achieving high HER activity of a Mo2C monolayer.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000592983900010	33196067

The surface Mn3+ formed as an intermediate species during water oxidation showed a d-d transition band with a peak at 510 nm at pH 6, while the peak shifted to 470 nm at pH 13. This shift of the absorption peak is attributed to the deprotonation of hydroxyl ligands of Mn3+ from OH- to O2-. Interrelation between the protonation state of Mn3+ and the O-2 evolution activity of MnO2 electrocatalysts is discussed.

Zn-air battery powered water splitting devices require the development of highly active and durable trifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER/ORR/HER). However, engineering rational nano-scaled designs and achieving the required synergy are major challenges due to the lack/weak control of synthesis processes. Herein, ZIF-67 regular polyhedra were fabricated for the first time to incorporate single ZnO nanorods. Thereafter, pyrolysis sacrificed the nanorods and stimulated intriguing modifications on the ZnONR@ZIF-67-derived CoOx@N, O-doped hierarchical carbon (CoOx@NOC), not only from the outside-in, but also from the inside out. Consequently, an outstanding enhancement in OER/ORR/HER trifunctional activity was achieved. The CoOx@NOC based Zn-air battery showed a small initial charge-discharge voltage gap of 92 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a high specific capacity and maximum power density of 757.39 mA h g(Zn)(-1) and 141.65 mW cm(-2), respectively. A CoOx@NOC-based all-solid-state Zn-air battery (SS ZAB) was fabricated, which showed a high open circuit potential of 1.49 V. Two SS ZABs in series drove an overall water splitting system, which showed an intriguingly low potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2), surpassing most reported electrocatalysts. Thus, the excellent performance of CoOx@NOC implies its great potential to compete with noble metal electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000651425200001

It was shown that by lowering the calcination temperature, the OER activity of the two materials increased significantly, yielding a maximum at 300 degrees C. The increase in electrocatalytic activity of the oxides was related to the change in intrinsic properties of the anodes, predominantly to the modification of the electronic structure and to the increase in hydroxide content. The (Ni0.4Co0.6)(0.90)Ir-0.10-oxide was found to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art OER electrocatalyst, pure Ir-oxide, while the electrocatalytic activity of (Ni0.4Co0.6)(0.90)Ru-0.10-oxide was measured to be much higher than that of the Ni0.4Co0.6-oxide base, thus demonstrating the synergistic action of Ni/Co/Ir and Ni/Co/Ru in their oxides.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000687697400002

Herein, we construct a novel bimetallic phosphide catalyst (Mo-Ni-P) by the means of electronic reconfiguration and morphology engineering technology for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (HER and OER). Benefiting from the attractive nano-architectures of honeycomb spheres and the synergistic effect of Ni and Mo element with exposed abundant active sites, the optimized Mo-Ni-P exhibits satisfactory electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER. Meanwhile, theoretical density functional calculations reveal that the ternary electrocatalyst extremely facilitates the electrical activity and reduces the hydrogen adsorption energy. When explored as both the cathode and anode, the cell voltage was required by a low value of 1.589 V to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in alkaline solution, suggesting the remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting. This work not only provides insights into the structure-property relationships, but also developed an effective approach to design and prepare high-efficiency water-splitting electrocatalysts.

The composite materials demonstrate a sheet-like C3N4 structure, decorated with different Ag3PO4 particles sizes. Detailed analysis of the reactions mechanism by electron-spin resonance and radical-capture agents strongly imply the formation of an insitu Z-scheme by the evolution of small silver nanoparticles in the interface of the materials under illumination. The Ag nanoparticles improve charge separation within the composite material by acting as a storage and recombination center for electrons and holes from Ag3PO4 and C3N4, respectively. In addition, the photostability of Ag3PO4 is enhanced relative to that of the bulk materials, which results in a stabilized heterojunction. We believe that this work provides new insight into the operation mechanism of composite photocatalysts for water splitting and opens the possibility for advanced photocatalysis based on the higher oxidation power of Ag3PO4.									171	8	0	0	10	0	172			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000353511400008	25693743

Herein, we report a systematic study on the tuning of the electronic structure of La2-xSrxNiMnO6 with 0 <= x <= 1.0 to promote the bifunctional OER/ORR activity. The bifunctional index (Delta E) is substantially reduced with increasing of Sr contents and achieves an optimal value of 0.85 V for La1.4Sr0.6NiMnO6, exceeding that of widely studied LaNiO3. Our study on electronic structures reveals that the enhancement of the ORR and OER activities strongly correlates with the appearance of Ni3+ oxidation states and the upshift of the O 2p-band center promoted by Sr doping. Furthermore, an increase of hole states, derived from Ni3+ states, reduces the energy barrier for the electron transfer from 0.44 to 0.12 eV and hence improves the intrinsic OER activities. The tuning of the electronic structure that leads to higher OER and ORR activities in La2-xSrxNiMnO6 can be extended to other materials for the design of active bifunctional electrocatalysts.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000634551000016

In this study, we synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon-decorated CoP@FeCoP yolkshelled micro-polyhedras (denoted as CoP@FeCoP/NC YSMPs) via the phosphorization of ZIF-67@Co-Fe Prussian blue analogues YSMPs. The yolk-shelled construction and nitrogen-doped carbon matrix can effectively reduce the degree of CoP agglomeration, which is beneficial for increasing the specific surface area and active sites of the catalysts. The synergistic effect of yolk-shelled structure and nigtrogen-doped carbon matrix also optimizes the electronic structure and enhances the electrocatalytic activity of CoP@FeCoP/NC YSMPs. In an alkaline electrolyte, the overpotentials of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction only need 141 and 238 mV, respectively, to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). When a two-electrode water splitting device was conducted with the as-prepared catalyst, it required only a low cell voltage of 1.68 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and displayed outstanding stability over 20 h. This work offers insights into the facile, controllable synthesis strategy of various non-precious metal nanomaterials for high-efficiency water splitting electrocatalysis.									143	6	0	0	6	0	144			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000579752500042

Rotating disk electrodes were made from commercial RuO2-catalyzed DSAs and studied in steady-state polarization measurements, mainly IR-corrected polarization curves. Effects of varying pH and electrolyte concentrations of chloride, chlorate, chromium(VI), hypochlorite (ClO- + ClOH) as well as mass transport were studied. The kinetics for the chlorine evolution reaction, with a Tafel slope of 40 mV/decade of current, was not dependent on pH in the region 2-8, at potentials lower than 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The slope of the polarization curves increased at about 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, a pH-dependent bend not due to mass-transport limitations in the electrolyte. At a pH of 6.5, typical for the chlorate process, oxygen evolution is an important side reaction favored by the dichromate buffer and by increased mass transport, both keeping down the pH at the anode. In the chlorine evolution region the potentials increased when adding Cr(VI) to the electrolyte, whereas no major effect was seen from additions of NaClO.

The atomically thin NiPS3 nanosheets are obtained by exfoliation of bulk NiPS3 in the presence of an ionic surfactant. The OER mechanism was studied by a combination of SECM, in situ Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and XPS measurements, which enabled direct observation of the formation of a NiPS3@NiOOH core shell heterostructure at the electrode interface. Hence, the active form of the catalyst is represented as NiPS3@NiOOH core shell structure. Moreover, DFT calculations indicate an intrinsic metallic character of the NiPS3 nanosheets with densities of states (DOS) similar to the bulk material. The high OER activity of the NiPS3 nanosheets is attributed to a high density of accessible active metallic-edge and defect sites due to structural disorder, a unique NiPS3@NiOOH core shell heterostructure, where the presence of P and S modulates the rface electronic structure of Ni in NiPS3, thus providing excellent conductive pathway for efficient electron-transport to the NiOOH shell. These findings suggest that good size control during liquid exfoliation may be advantageously used for the formation of electrically conductive NiPS3@ NiOOH core shell electrode materials for the electrochemical water oxidation.									176	8	0	0	4	0	176			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200027		
J	Guo, Jianing; Xu, Nengneng; Wang, Yongxia; Wang, Xu; Huang, Haitao; Quo, Jinli				Huang, Haitao/F-9697-2010	Huang, Haitao/0000-0002-3861-2702			Bimetallic Sulfide with Controllable Mg Substitution Anchored on CNTs as Hierarchical Bifunctional Catalyst toward Oxygen Catalytic Reactions for Rechargeable Zinc-Air Batteries								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				12	33			37164	37172		10.1021/acsami.0c09385				AUG 19 2020	2020	The exploitation of high-efficiency and cheap bifunctional cathode electrocatalyst is of significant importance to rechargeable zinc-air batteries. In this paper, a bimetallic sulfide coupled with a CNT ((Co, MOS2@CNTs) hybrid catalyst is developed via a proposed vulcanization process. The (Co, Mg)S-2@CNTs) with controllable Mg substitution has a tailored crystal structure (amorphous and crystalline), which catalyzes the oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The active sites of CoS2@CNTs are activated by doping Mg ions, which accelerates the kinetics of the oxygen adsorption for ORR and oxygen desorption for OER. Meanwhile, the hybrid catalyst exhibits a unique hierarchal morphology and a "catalytic buffer", which further accelerate the mass transfer of catalytic processes. In addition, the outer wall of CNTs as substrate effectively avoid the agglomeration of (Co, Mg)S-2 particles by reasonably providing adsorption sites. The inner and outer walls of CNTs form a high-speed conduction pathway, quickly transferring the electrons produced by oxygen catalytic reactions. As a result, the (Co, Mg)S-2@CNTs exhibit an ORR performance comparable with commercial catalyst Pt/C-RuO2 and remarkable OER performance (E-j=10 = 1.59 V). The high power density of 268 mW cm(-2) and long-term charge/discharge stability of the zinc-air battery proves the feasibility of (Co, Mg)S-2@CNTs application in high-power devices.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000563074900034	32667803

J	Amin, Hatem M. A.; Molls, Christoph.; Bawol, Pawel P.; Baltruschat, Helmut								The impact of solvent properties on the performance of oxygen reduction and evolution in mixed tetraglyme-dimethyl sulfoxide electrolytes for Li-O-2 batteries: Mechanism and stability								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				245				967	980		10.1016/j.electacta.2017.06.012				AUG 10 2017	2017	The instability of the electrolyte and the sluggish kinetics of the reactions hinder the application of Li-O-2 batteries. In this study, we aim to better understand the behavior of oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution (OER) reactions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Tetraglyme (G4) and their blend DMSO-G4, with emphasis on the role of solvent nature in the mechanism and reaction route, using rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Interestingly, RRDE results showed that the stability and the ratio of the formed O-2(-.) : Li2O2 increase with addition of DMSO to G4. A proposed mechanism for ORR is discussed. Depending on the solvation ability of the solvent, which primarily determines the lifetime and solubility of the superoxide intermediate in solution, a solution or a surface-based pathway is followed: in highly solvating solvents (e.g. those with high donor or acceptor number) such as DMSO, superoxide is stabilized in solution; while in low solvating solvent, it is further reduced to Li2O2, blocking the surface. The results of the scan rate variation under defined mass transport in DMSO suggest a sequential formation of monolayers of Li2O2 during reduction. In G4-solutions, despite of the reversible formation of Li2O2, deactivation of the electrode takes place, as evidenced by DEMS. This could arise from a reduction products-induced decomposition of the electrolyte, forming a deactivating film on the surface during ORR, which is only partially removed at higher potentials evolving CO2. Also, we found that DMSO is more active towards OER than G4. The electrode material as well influences the kinetics, in particular of OER. These findings could have implications for the development of Li-air battery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									16	0	0	0	3	0	16			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000406762700106

The 3D electrode is comprised of three types of structures including the bottom square Ti mesh structure as the conductive substrate, a vertical and uniform Ni0.85Se nanosheet arrays structure in the intermediate section, and the topmost Ni0.85Se flower structure. This triple hierarchy architecture is binder-free, conductive, and has a particular feature of enlarged surface areas, exposing more active sites, promoting mass- and charge-transfer, and accelerating dissipation of gases generated during water electrolysis. Moreover, DFT calculations confirmed that the Ni0.85Se possesses metallic character, which further promotes the charge transfer of the electrocatalyst. Benefiting from this special structure and metallic character, the electrode displays a superior activity of 10mAcm(-2) at 120mV hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and 30mAcm(-2) at 270mV oxygen evolution reaction overpotential. By using this electrode as a bifunctional electrocatalyst, an alkali electrolyzer affords a water splitting current of 10mAcm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.66V.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000472806800023	30830725

The reaction mechanisms between cathode/anode and electrolyte in the battery at different temperatures were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC), gas chromatography/mass spectrometry(GC/MS)and X-ray diffraction(XRD).The experimental results show that the ISC failure of the battery was mainly due to the reaction between cathode Li0.5 CoO2 and electrolyte. The decomposition and oxygen evolution reactions of cathode occurred when the temperature reached a certain value.At the same time a fierce oxidation reaction occurred between oxygen and electrolyte, giving out a large quantity of CO_2 gas, and breaking aluminum can, thus causing the battery exploded. And the decomposition of SEI film and the initial reaction between anode and electrolyte were mainly to accumulating heat for the reaction between cathode and electrolyte.			应用电池挤压试验机研究了锂离子电池内部短路失效过程, 并由DSC、GC/MS和XRD分析了电池内部的正极、负极和电解液之间在不同温度下的反应机理.实验表明, 正极Li~(0.5)CoO_2与电解液的反应是导致电池内部短路失效的根本原因.电池因内部短路发热, 一旦温度达到正极Li_(0.5)CoO_2的分解温度时, 正极瞬时分解, 并释放出O_2.后者与电解液瞬间发生剧烈反应, 同时放出大量CO_2气体, 冲破电池壳体, 造成电池发生爆炸.其中 SEI膜自身的分解反应以及负极与电解液在初期的反应都为正极与电解液反应起了积累热量的作用.						0	7	0	0	0	0	7			1006-3471			CSCD:3920895

Herein, Fe doped NiS nanosheets directly grown on conductive carbon fiber paper (Fe-NiS@CFP) were fabricated through a two-step hydrothermal process. The microstructure, interface and electronic states of the prepared sample were modulated by Fe doping, exhibiting small internal and interface charge-transfer resistance. Benefiting from these factors, Fe-NiS@CFP shows superior electrocatalytic performance with an overpotential of 275 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) and maintains the activity for at least 50 h as a working electrode for the OER. This work may provide insights into the design and fabrication of non-noble metal sulfide electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2516-0230			WOS:000748367000001	36131760

In this work, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) obtained from natural plant fiber with distinctive three-dimensional networks are used as structural skeletons and conductive substrates for electrocatalytic materials. One-step pyrolysis of aerogel composed of CNF and nickel salt yields Ni@Ni2P nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped interconnected carbonized CNF and carbon nanotubes (denoted as Ni@Ni2P/N-CNF-CN). Benefiting from the desirable characteristics conferred by the carbon substrates, such as large specific surface area, multitudinous mesopores, and favorable conductivity, the hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward OER with a low overpotential of 269 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 65.0 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. Furthermore, the as-prepared catalyst also reveals favorable stability with 1.7% decay after 20 h long-term chronopotentiometry testing. The approach to convert inexpensive and renewable biopolymers into high value-added carbon based electrocatalytic materials described in the present work provides novel, green, and broader opportunities for the utilization of biomass materials.									15	1	0	0	0	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000511244200019

Aiming at enhancement of oxygen electrode kinetics and durability, composite support materials for iridium oxide are synthesized via in situ phosphorization reaction on tin doped indium oxide and possess functionalities of high electronic and intrinsic proton conductivity. At 130 degrees C under a water vapor atmosphere an overall conductivity of 0.72 S cm(-1) is achieved with a contribution of around 10(-2) S cm(-1) proton conductivity. The support structure of three-dimensionally ordered hexagonal arrays displays a high specific surface area of 180 m(2) g(-1). Benefiting from the mixed conductivities and porous structure in the composite support materials, the supported IrO2 catalysts exhibit about five times enhancement of the OER activity in acidic electrolytes. The improved catalytic performance for the OER was further confirmed by PEM electrolyzer tests at 130 degrees C. A test of such a steam electrolyzer cell at 350 mA cm(-2) shows good durability within a period of up to 1150 hours.									62	2	0	0	5	0	63			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000331413700038

The strong synergistic interaction between Fc-Co(x)S(y)nanostructures and electrically conductive CNTs results in the superior electrocatalytic activity with a very small overpotential of approximate to 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and a low Tafel slope of 54.2 mV dec(-1)in 1mKOH electrolyte. Furthermore, the Fc-incorporated CoxSy(FCoS) nanostructures are directly grown on the acid pretreated carbon fiber (ACF), and the resulting fabricated electrode delivers excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of approximate to 315 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Such superior OER catalytic activity can be attributed to 3D Fc-Co(x)S(y)nanoarchitectures that consist of a high concentration of vertical nanosheets with uniform distribution of nanoparticles that afford a large number of active surface areas and edge sites. Besides, the tight contact interface between ACF substrate and Fc-Co(x)S(y)nanostructures could effectively facilitate the electron transfer rate in the OER. This study provides valuable insights for the rational design of energy storage and conversion materials by the incorporation of other transition metal into metal sulfide/oxide nanostructures utilizing metallocene.									35	2	0	0	4	0	35			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000543752400001	32597017

Here we discovered that ultrasound cavitation can break up oxygen-containing groups on the surface of carbon dots (CDs) to generate ROS, giving rise to a novel mechanism different from as-reported those. The bond cleavage of oxygen-containing groups contribute transient oxygen free radicals (center dot O-) that involve in the subsequent formation of ROS by quickly reacting with hydrogen ions and water, thereby leading to a twice higher sonocatalytic activity of CDs than TiO2. Moreover, the sonosensitizer function of CDs can be tuned by pH values of the surrounding environment that determine the generation and evolution reaction of oxygen free radicals under ultrasound irradiation. This finding paves a new way to design multifunctional sonosensitizers and utilize them in various fields. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The method includes mass transfer as a consequence of diffusion, convection and migration, combined with the electroneutrality condition and linearized temperature dependent polarization relations at the electrolyte-electrode interface. Concentration and temperature dependent expressions are used for the diffusion coefficients and electrolyte viscosity. The electrolyte flow field is calculated using the laminar Navier-Stokes equations for viscous incompressible flow. Heat is generated in the bulk solution and in the electrical double layer. The electrodes are cooled by natural convection. The level set method is used for tracking the anode interface. The model is applied to the electrochemical machining of steel in a NaNO3 supporting electrolyte. Hydrogen is formed at the cathode, and metal dissolution and oxygen evolution reactions are considered at the anode. The effect of water depletion at the electrodes is modeled by limiting the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction rates depending on the local surface water concentration. The heat conduction through electrodes and the heat production by the electrode reactions are found to play an important role. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a simple strategy was developed to derive FeNi incorporated N-doped carbon nanotube (denoted as glu-NiFe) from glucosamine. Extensive metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) and FeNi alloys act as electrocatalytic active sites for ORR and OER, respectively, together with highly graphitized carbon nanotubes for facilitating electron transport. And the combinations endow glu-NiFe with an ORR half-wave potential of 0.85 V and an OER potential of 1.67 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which exceed commercial catalysts of Pt/C and RuO2. Furthermore, the rechargeable Zn-air battery based on glu-NiFe delivers a high peak power density of 127 mW cm(-2) and superior cycling stability (over 240 h). Moreover, a favorable performance is exhibited by glu-NiFe based all solid-state Zn-air battery.

Nonthermally oxidized Ir nanoparticles supported on antimony-doped tin oxide (SnO2:Sb, ATO) aerogel allow decreasing the use of the precious metal by more than 70% while enhancing the electrocatalytic activity and stability. To date, the origin of these benefits remains unknown. Here, we present clear evidence of the mechanisms that lead to the enhancement of the electrochemical properties of the catalyst. Operando near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on membrane electrode assemblies reveals a low degree of Ir oxidation, attributed to the oxygen spill-over from Ir to SnO2:Sb. Furthermore, the formation of highly unstable Ir(III) species is mitigated, while the decrease of Ir dissolution in Ir/SnO2:Sb is confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mechanisms that lead to the high activity and stability of Ir catalysts supported on SnO2:Sb aerogel for PEMWE are thus unveiled.									36	1	0	0	1	0	37			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400011

However, it is still at the infant stage as the unsatisfactory of the design strategies for bifunctional catalysts toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution, which leads to high working potential compared to the theoretical value. Here, for the first time, we report a galvanostatic immobilization of ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) into the oxygen vacancy of urchin-like tungsten trioxide (VoWO3) and show low overpotentials of 17, 34, and 64 mV at -10 mA cm-2 under acid, alkaline, and neutral H2 evolution, respectively. As an efficient bifunctional catalyst, the Vo-WO3/Ru SAs is firstly introduced to HzOR and achieves low working potential of -58 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The HzOR-assisted OWS also delivers an ultralow cell voltage of only 25 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline medium, which is far beyond the platinum and most of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Additionally, this coupled system can also be well performed under neutral condition, realizing a cell voltage of only 137 mV at 10 mA cm-2. The excellent pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS activity is attributed to the particular electronic configuration between Ru SAs and WO3, the immobilization of Ru SAs in WO3 could induce electron redistribution and optimize free energy of hydrogen adsorption in hydrogen evolution, while the isolation of Ru SAs also leads to the electropositivity of W sites and tends to accelerate the oxidation of hydrazine.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000727765400003

Herein, two-dimensional (2D) NiMn-LDHs on the surface of 2D Ti3C2 MXene are synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. It is found that a thin layer of NiMn-LDHs is firstly deposited on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene, and gradually it extends out of the surface for continuous growth, and finally the 2D/2D hybrid structure is constructed. Owing to this unique feature of such a kind of 2D/2D hybrid, the NiMn-LDHs/Ti3C2-MXene hybrids (NT-10) show an overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 83.7 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The results demonstrate the outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance which surpasses those of pristine NiMn-LDHs and commercial IrO2 catalysts. Theoretical studies reveal that the coupling effect between Ti3C2 MXene and NiMn-LDHs could effectively narrow the bandgap of NiMn-LDHs and modulate their electronic structures, which could greatly boost the oxygen-evolving performances and reaction kinetics. In principle, this work provides a facile and effective strategy to boost the electrocatalytic OER performance of NiMn-LDHs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000788170100001

A series of multinary metal-organic gels (MOGs) with various and alterable metal element compositions are prepared by straightforward mixing of metal ions with ligand 4,4 ',4 ''-[(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(azanediyl)]tribenzoic acid (H(3)TATAB) in solution at room temperature. Spinel-type metal oxides with excellent electrocatalytic OER performance were then obtained through calcination of the as-synthesized MOGs. In electrochemical testing, the trimetallic oxide CoFeNi-O-1 (derived from the MOG with a Co/Fe/Ni molar ratio of 5:1:4) exhibits remarkable catalytic activity with a low overpotential of 244 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 55.4 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte, outperforming most recently reported electrocatalysts. This work not only provides a promising OER catalyst and enriches the application of MOGs in the catalytic field, but also offers a facile new route to acquiring multicomponent metal oxides with high electrocatalytic activity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000473878300020	30866174

Co-phosphate-based bifunctional materials can be a plausible option owing to the enhanced stability imparted by the phosphate group. Inspired by the possibility, we report solution combustion synthesized porous Na2CoPO4F as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Comparable to the existing conventional electrocatalysts, porous Na2CoPO4F exhibits robust bifunctional (ORR/OER) properties. Having F-based chemistry, the dissolution is minimal in an aqueous medium, paving a way for its use as a cathode for the aqueous rechargeable hybrid Na-air battery. Thus, based on the bifunctional catalytic performances and stability in an aqueous medium, this material can be envisaged as a cheap and an efficient catalyst for fuel cell as well as a cathode for metal-air batteries.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			2155-5435			WOS:000506725100006

We compared the OER activities by the free-energy changes on three different covered surfaces including (i) clean, (ii) 0.5 monolayer O covered, and (iii) 0.5 monolayer OH covered surfaces, and the computed overpotential (eta) for the three surfaces followed the order: O covered (eta = 0.45 V) < OH covered (0.93 V) < clean (1.82 V). Furthermore, the influence of activities was analyzed by Bader charge, which showed that the Co Bader charge on the O/OH covered (100) surface was more than that on the clean surface. Based the above analysis, the O-containing species covered Co3O4 (100) surface exhibited better OER catalytic performance than that of the clean surface in the OER cycle.[GRAPHICS].									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000354205800008

This loop-sheet feature with lifted-edges prevents the stacking of nanosheets and induces accessible open channels for catalytic site exposure and gas bubble release. Importantly, these NiFeP@NC/Ni2P hybrids exhibit a remarkable oxygen evolution activity with an overpotential of 223 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 46.1 mV dec(-1), constituting the record-high performance among reported metal phosphide electrocatalysts. The NiFeP@NC/Ni2P hybrids are also employed as both anode and cathode to achieve an alkaline electrolyzer for overall water splitting, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a voltage of 1.57 V, comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C||RuO2 couple (1.56 V). Moreover, a photovoltaic-electrolysis coupling system can as well be effectively established for robust overall water splitting. Evidently, this ingenious protocol would expand the toolbox for designing efficient 2D nanomaterials for practical applications.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000609916600001	33480477

Various hydrogen coverage on these surfaces is considered, the free energy diagram and overpotentials are predicted as well as the kinetics of hydrogen recombination and hydrogen evolution reaction. The outcome of this comprehensive investigation and comparison of activity between the (100) and (111) facets reveal that TaN is the most active surface in both facets with the (100) being more promising with regards to both thermodynamics and kinetics. This study suggests that for optimizing the efficiency in the experiments, surface engineering needs to be considered towards the synthesis of single-crystal structured catalysts rather than utilizing polycrystallines. All the results are also compared with the Pt (111) which is the most active hydrogen evolution catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000673177000001

Low-energy mechanism for laser ablation of high-temperature superconductors								Soviet Technical Physics Letters				15	4			321	3						April 1989	1989	A mechanism for laser damage to high-temperature superconductors is examined, which involves the evolution of oxygen during the thermal decomposition of the ceramic. It is shown that when the radiant energy density reaches a certain threshold an oscillatory regime sets in, in which the temperature and the oxygen pressure at the temperature and the oxygen pressure at the chemical-reaction front vary nonmonotonically with time. Under certain conditions, the process is unstable, with the result that the surface is heated to a substantial degree, and P increases sharply. It is shown that the kinetics of the laser damage, the mechanism for the ablation, and the ablation threshold depend on the porosity of the ceramic, and typical pore dimension, and laser pulse length.									1	0	0		0	0	1			0360-120X			INSPEC:3576528

In this work, hollow N-doped carbon networks (N-CNs) were fabricated via interfacial dehalogenation of polyvinyl dichloride (PVDC) on 2D CoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH) with the presence of N source and used as efficient bifunctional catalysts. BET results revealed that as-made N-CNs had very large specific surface area (SSA, 550.4 m(2) g (1) for 900 degrees C-annealed N-CN (N-CN9)) and abundant pore hierarchy. Additionally, interconnected graphitic carbon walls, forming separated cells, can ensure high electrical conductivity, which were formed after acid-leaching of metallic components. Remarkably, N-CN9 showed excellent bifunctional activities towards oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Moreover, N-CN9 assembled Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibited an operating voltage of 1.35 V under applied current density of 1.0 mA cm (2), which is highly comparable to that of PtRu/C catalyst. Moreover, due to the pore hierarchy and large SSA, N-CN9-ZAB possessed much better rate capability and cycling stability than that of PtRu/C-ZAB.

Herein, the OER processes for different SACs based on various mono-layer materials, such as transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) and group-III monochalcogenide mono-layers, have been systematically investigated, based on which we demonstrate that the adsorption energy (E-ad) of transition-metal (TM) atoms can serve as a promising single-parameter descriptor in conveniently and efficiently predicting the catalytic performance of SACs for the OER. A favorable linear relationship between E-ad and adsorption free energy of reaction intermediates as well as the overpotential of the OER was evidenced. The reliability of the proposed descriptor was verified using nearly 100 samples together with the consistent results compared with the available experimental data. More importantly, such a single-parameter descriptor, E-ad, can be obtained directly from the initial optimized structures, offering a simple and efficient strategy for evaluating the performance of SACs. Thus, this highlighted descriptor without the need for considering the complicated reaction process can not only reduce the computational cost but also assist in designing non-noble SACs to substitute experimentally identified Ru/Ir-based catalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000631985900045

CQDs can be prepared simply and inexpensively by multiple techniques, such as the arc-discharge method, microwave pyrolysis, hydrothermal method, and electrochemical synthesis. CQDs show excellent physical and chemical properties like high crystallization, good dispersibility, photoluminescence properties. In particular, the small size, superconductivity, and rapid electron transfer of CQDs endow the CQDs-based composite with improved electric conductivity and catalytic activity. Besides, CQDs have abundant functional groups on the surface which could facilitate the preparation of multi-component electrical active catalysts. The interactions inside these multi-component catalysts may further enhance the catalytic performance by promoting charge transfer which plays an important role in electrochemistry. Most recent researches on CQDs have focused on their fluorescence characteristics and photocatalytic properties. This review will summarize the primary advances of CQDs in the synthetic methods, excellent physical and electronic properties, and application in electrocatalysis, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reduction (HER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).									149	3	0	0	26	0	149			2296-2646			WOS:000497413700001	31637234

In this study, we revisit the OER activities of the two most abundant crystallographic facets of pristine beta-NiOOH, the (0001) and (10 (1) over bar0) facets, which expose 6-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated and 5-foldlattice-oxygen-coordinated Ni sites, respectively. To this end, we model various active sites on these two facets using hybrid density functional theory, which includes a fraction of the exact nonlocal Fock exchange in the electronic description of the system. By evaluating thermodynamic OER overpotentials, we show that the two active sites considered on each crystallographic facet demonstrate OER activities remarkably different from However, the lowest OER overpotentials calculated for the two facets were found to be similar to each other and comparable to the overpotential for the 4-fold-lattice-oxygen-coordinated Ni site on the ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1) facet of beta-NiOOH previously examined in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2019, 141, 1, 693-705. This finding shows that all of the low-index facets investigated so far could be responsible for the experimentally observed OER activity of pristine beta-NiOOH. However, the lowest overpotential active sites on these three crystallographic facets operate via different mechanisms, underscoring the importance of considering multiple OER pathways and intermediates on each crystallographic facet of a potential electrocatalyst. Specifically, our work demonstrates that consideration of previously overlooked active sites, transition-metal-ion oxidation states, reaction intermediates, and lattice-oxygen-stabilization are critical to reveal the lowest overpotential OER pathways on pristine beta-NiOOH.									60	4	0	0	3	0	60			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000515214000043	31961150

However, the cell voltage of an electrolyzer is still too high for practical application, which is mainly limited by the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction process. To this end, hybrid water electrolyzers have drawn tremendous attention. Herein, coaxial Ni/Ni3S2@N-doped nanofibers are directly grown on nickel foam (NF), which is highly active for hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the Ni3S2@N-doped nanofibers on NF prepared in an Ar atmosphere display superior urea oxidation reaction performance to previously reported catalysts. The cell voltage is about 1.50 V in urea electrolysis to deliver a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), lower than that of a traditional water electrolyzer (1.82 V). The current density is around 77% relative to its initial value of 20 mA cm(-2) after 20 h, superior to Pt/ClIr/C-based urea electrolysis (14%). It is found that the synergistic effect between metallic Ni and Ni3S2, as well as the interfacial effect between metal centers and N-doped carbon, favors the initial dissociation of H2O and the adsorption/desorption of H* with thermal neutral Gibbs free energy. Meanwhile, the in-situ generated NiOOH on the outer surface of Ni3S2 possessed lower electrochemical activation energy for urea decomposition. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen vacancies in electrodes could expose more active sites for the adsorption of intermediates, including H* and OOH*. It is also found that the hierarchical nanostructure of densely packed nanowires provides ideal electronic and ionic transport paths for fast electrocatalytic kinetics. The present work indicated that the modulation of compositions and hierarchical nanostructure is effective to prepare efficient catalysts for H-2 production via urea electrolysis.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000614062400040	33439615

These measurements demonstrated that the cyclic carbonate solvents are unstable during the ORR Neither O-2(-) nor lithium peroxide (Li2O2) was found in these carbonate solutions during the ORR. Several ORR products of peroxodicarbonate (C2O62-) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) were observed on the electrode surface in the PC-based electrolyte solution, depending on whether or not the Li ion is included in the solution.

One major challenge for OER is to develop durable and cost-effective electrocatalysts with high catalytic performance. Herein, a controllable ion-exchange method to synthesize amorphous zinc/cobalt-iron hydroxide-based hollow nanowall arrays (A-Zn/Co-Fe HNAs) derived from bimetallic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on carbon cloth is reported. The amorphous characteristic enables the presented materials with more electrocatalytic sites and short diffusion paths for rapid access to the electrolyte, achieving efficient charge transfer for OER. The optimized nanostructure of A-Zn/Co-Fe HNAs via tuning the amount of iron sulfate in the reaction solution delivers a low overpotential of 226 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 37.81 mV dec(-1) while exhibiting high durability at varied current densities over 80 h. The remarkable electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect from chemical elements of Zn, Co-Fe, and a robust hollow structure. This simple method of fabricating bimetallic-MOF-derived amorphous Zn/Co-Fe HNAs on carbon cloth can be applied as a practical platform for other OER electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000707487200001	34655163

CO2 is a minor component, accounting for a maximum of 10% of the carbon species at 650 K and dropping to 2% when the temperature is raised to 1000 K. The relative yields of CO and CO2, as well as the reaction rate for CO production, are strongly influenced by surface oxygen concentration, controlled through the relative ratio of oxygen and benzene flu:res, with the fastest rate of CO production and the greatest proportion of CO2 occurring under the most oxidizing conditions. Because the catalytic decomposition of benzene is rapid on the rhodium surface, the kinetics of CO and CO2 evolution are dominated by the reaction of atomic carbon and oxygen species on the surface. We calculate an activation energy for the reaction C(a) + O(a) --> CO(a) of 130 kJ/mol. CO2 is produced by the further reaction of CO with adsorbed O, with the extent of reaction being substantially influenced by reaction at defect sites. CO is evolved with a thermal kinetic energy distribution, while CO2 desorbs hyperthermally. (C) 2000 Academic Press.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0021-9517			WOS:000086348200021		
J	Liu, Taifeng; Liu, Ruyue; Li, Quye; Yang, Jianjun								Theoretical Insight into the Role of Defects and Facets in the Selectivity of Products in Water Oxidation over Bismuth Vanadate (BiVO4)								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				8	4			1980	1988		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b06404				FEB 3 2020	2020	Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is an efficient photocatalyst or photo anode in water oxidation. However, the product selectivity in water oxidation over the most exposed clean and defective (001) and (101) facets is not clear. In this work, we investigated the water oxidation reaction on clean and oxygen deficient (001) and (101) facets and on Mo/W-doped facets using density functional theory. The pure (001) facet, we found, promotes OH radical formation. In the presence of oxygen vacancies, the O-2 evolution is preferred on the (101) facet with an overpotential of 0.52 V. On doping with Mo/W, the H2O2 evolution is preferred on the (101) facet with the overpotential of about 0.40 V; while on the (001) facet, the O-2 evolution is preferred with the overpotential of about 0.5 V. We also found that, on the (101) facet, there is a strong charge transfer from Bi atoms to the intermediates of water oxidation; but on the (001) facet, there is not. Our calculations could guide the design of the photocatalyst toward specific products of the water oxidation reaction, such as an OH radical, H2O2, or O-2. Moreover, the results show that the preferred sorption on the (101) facet may be a reason for the photoinduced charge separation between (101) and (001) facets of BiVO4.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000511244200032		
J	Bricker, TM; Lowrance, J; Sutton, H; Frankel, LK								Alterations of the oxygen-evolving apparatus in a (448)Arg -> S-448 mutant in the CP47 protein of photosystem II under normal and low chloride conditions								BIOCHEMISTRY				40	38			11483	11489		10.1021/bi010906x				SEP 25 2001	2001	We have shown previously that a mutant which contained the alteration R-448 --> S-448 (R448S) in the CP47 protein of photosystem II exhibited a defect in its ability to grow and assemble functional photosystem. II reaction centers under chloride-limiting conditions [Wu, J., Masri, N., Lee, W., Frankel, L. K., and Bricker, T. M. (1999) Plant Mol. Biol. 39, 381-386]. In this paper we have examined the function of the oxygen-evolving complex under chloride-sufficient (480 muM) and chloride-limiting (< 20 IM) conditions. When placed under chloride-limiting conditions, both the control strain K3 and R448S cells exhibit a loss of steady-state oxygen evolution, with t(1/2) of 16 and 17 min, respectively. Upon the addition of chloride, both recover their oxygen-evolving capacity relatively rapidly. However, R448S exhibits a much slower reactivation of oxygen evolution than does K3 (t(1/2) of 308 and 50 s, respectively). This may indicate a defect at the low-affinity, rapidly exchanging chloride-binding site [Lindberg, K., and Andreasson, L.-E. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 14259-14267]. Additionally, alterations in the distribution of S states and S-state lifetimes were observed. Under chloride-sufficient conditions, the R448S mutant exhibits a significant increase in the proportion of reaction centers in the S-3 state and a greatly increased lifetime of the S-3 state. Under chloride-limiting conditions, the proportion of reaction centers in both the S-2 and S-3 states increases significantly, and there is a marked increase in the lifetime of the S-2 state. These alterations are not observed in the control strain K3. Our observations support the hypothesis that R-448 of CP47 may participate in the formation of the binding domain for chloride in photosystem II and/or in the functional interaction with the 33 kDa protein with the photosystem.									11	0	0	0	11	0	12			0006-2960			WOS:000171205300021	11560496

The investigated Pt-Fe/Ebonex exhibits enhanced efficiency compared to pure Pt with the same catalytic loading due to formation of surface oxides and electronic hypo hyper-d-electron interactions between the hypo-d metallic components (Fe and Ti), on one hand and the hyper-d Pt, on the other hand. The utilization of the catalysts is assessed applying a repetitive potential cycling at varying scan rate to determine the morphology factor f, serving as a measure for the unusable part of the catalyst. The results obtained show that the part of the Pt-Fe/Ebonex not accessible for the electrochemical reaction, is less than that for the pure platinum catalyst. The Ebonex-based GDL has a good electrical conductivity and is more resistant to oxidation than a commercial carbon black GDL which has a positive impact on the stability of the catalyst, the oxygen electrode, and the MEA.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0324-1130			WOS:000342409900033

On the basis of first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the 2D Janus group-III chalcogenide multilayers: InGaXY, M2XY and InGaX2 (M = In/Ga; X, Y = S/Se/Te), are promising photocatalysts for highly-efficient overall water splitting. The intrinsic electric field enhances the spatial separations of photogenerated carriers and alters the band alignment, which is more pronounced compared with the Janus monolayers. High solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency with the upper limit of 38.5% was predicted in the Janus multilayers. More excitingly, the Ga vacancy of InGaSSe bilayer effectively lowers the overpotentials of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to the levels provided solely by the photogenerated carriers. Our theoretical results suggest that the 2D Janus group-III chalcogenide multilayers could be utilized as highly efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting without the needs of sacrificial reagents.

However, it still remains challenges due to their uncontrollable factor at atomic level during the catalysts preparation, which requires the precise regulation of active sites and structure engineering to accelerate the reaction kinetics for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a novel Co-doped mixed lanthanum oxide and hydroxide heterostructure (termed as Co-LaMOH|OV@NC) was synthesized by pyrolysis of La-MOF-NH2 with spontaneous cobalt doping. Synergistic coupling of its hollow structure, doping effect and abundant oxygen vacancies creates more active sites and leads to higher electroconductivity, which contribute to the better performance. As employed as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, the resulting 3Co-LaMOH| OV@NC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for both ORR and OER. In assembled ZAB, it also demonstrates an excellent power density of 110.5 mW cm(-2), high specific capacity of 810 mAh gZn(-1), and good stability over 100 h than those of Pt/C + RuO2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the heterointerfaces coupled with oxygen vacancies lead to an enhanced charge state and electronic structure, which may optimize the conductivity, charge transfer, and the reaction process of catalysts. This study provides a new strategy for designing highly efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts based on rare earth oxide and hydroxides heterointerface.

In this study, a Fe-enriched FeNi3 inter-metallic nanoparticle/nitrogen-doped carbon (Fe-enriched-FeNi3/NC) electrocatalyst was designed and prepared using a facile method based on plasma engineering. The excess Fe-ions in the Fe-enriched FeNi3 nanoparticles led to a high degree of lattice distortion that produced abundant oxygen-active sites. The electrocatalyst exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as well as favorable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in an alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the electrocatalyst revealed a lower potential difference (DE = 0.80 V vs. RHE) in a bifunctional oxygen reaction compared to that of the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C + Ir/C (DE = 0.84 V vs. RHE), and most of the reported FeNi3 alloy-doped carbon catalysts. Based on DFT calculations, the lattice distortion in Fe-enriched-FeNi3/NC promoted a higher density of active electrons around the Fermi level. Owing to its great bifunctional oxygen activities, Fe-enriched FeNi3/NC was applied as an ORR/OER catalyst in the air cathode in a homemade zinc-air battery and exhibited an excellent discharge-charge voltage gap (0.89 V), peak power density (89 mW/cm(2)), and high specific capacity of 734 mAh/g at 20 mA/cm(2), which outperformed the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C + Ir/C electrocatalyst. In summary, this research provides a novel strategy to enhance the OER/ORR activities of transition metal-based alloys through lattice distortion defects. In addition, it provides a new pathway for achieving noble metal-free air cathode materials for the next generation Zn-air battery. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A general colloidal chemistry method is demonstrated for making a series of ultrathin PtPdM (M = Co, Ni, Fe) nanorings (NRs) for greatly boosting ORR catalysis. Different from the traditional ultrathin nanosheets, the ultrathin PtPdM NRs herein have a high portion of step atoms on the edge, high Pt utilization efficiency, and strong ligand effect from M to Pt and fast mass transport of reactants to the NRs. These key features make them exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic activity for the ORR and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among all the PtPdM NRs, the PtPdCo shows the highest ORR mass and specific activities of 3.58 A mg(-1) and 4.90 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 23.9 and 24.5-fold larger than those of commercial Pt/C in alkaline electrolyte, respectively. The theoretical calculations reveal that the oxygen adsorption energy (E-O) can be optimized under the presence of step atoms exposed on the edge and ligand effect induced by Co. They are stable under ORR conditions with negligible changes after 30 000 cycles.									71	3	0	0	5	0	70			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000444671900009	30080292

Co loadings were prepared in the range from 4 to 40 wt%, and hydrogen and ammonia were applied in the thermal post-treatment of the CoOx/NCNT samples. The Co3O4 spinel structure was detected in all samples, while the thermal treatment in ammonia and hydrogen led to the formation of CoO and metallic Co in addition. Treatment in ammonia resulted in the partial reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and nitrogen doping of the oxides, leading to excellent electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and stability despite of the lower Co oxidation states compared with the sample calcined in air. In contrast, the sample reduced in hydrogen showed a lower activity and stability in the OER. The high activity of the ammonia-treated sample can be assigned to improved conductivity, favorable surface properties with surface nitrogen improving the hydrophilicity of the catalysts, and the more facile transformation to the OER-active layered cobalt oxyhydroxide phase under anodic conditions.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2196-0216			WOS:000410498700041

The development of an inexpensive catalyst with improved performance is key to produce hydrogen by the electrolytic water splitting reaction. The user friendly chemical solution deposition method was applied to prepare films with predecided mole concentrations of copper and nickel. The mixed metal oxide with equal mole ratio of Cu:Ni (1:1) achieved the maximum activity with the onset of water oxidation at overpotential of 0.40 V (1.63 V vs RHE) and achieved the current density of 1 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 0.420 V at pH 13. The activity of this combination is attributed to the copper facilitated in-situ formation of a layered nickel oxy-hydroxide structure. The presence of both metal ions was found to be necessary indicating a synergy between Cu and Ni for the oxygen evolution reaction. The present work representing the simple synthesis process of the catalyst with the improved water oxidation activity is a promising step to develop electrodes for water electrolysis.

Here, we demonstrate the use of MoSe2-Cu2S nanoheterostructures (NHSs) as an efficient electrocatalyst for water splitting. The interfacial engineering of the basal planes of MoSe2 nanosheets (NSs) with Cu2S nanocrystals (NCs) increases the number of active sites for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to the decoration of inert basal planes of MoSe2 NSs with an OER active material i.e. Cu2S NCs. Density functional theory calculations revealed a favorable type-II band alignment, and built-in electric field at heterointerfaces, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for interfacial charge transfer. As a consequence of the simultaneous increase of number of active sites and modulation of the electronic structure, the MoSe2-Cu2S NHSs exhibit higher OER activity with an overpotential of 264 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The built-in electric field phenomenon also greatly promotes hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of MoSe2-Cu2S NHSs in alkaline medium on account of the decreased kinetic energy barrier. This study sheds light on the importance of designing NHS-derived systems to tune the electrocatalytic properties for water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000637415800001

Herein, we report a template-free and rapid high-pressure synthesis protocol to fabricate irregular CoMoP2 nanoparticles for OER catalysts. Pure CoMoP2 electrocatalysts show a reduced overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), improved kinetics and long-term stability. XAS, XPS and DFT calculations reveal that the reorganization induces highly active Co sites with a Co(OH)(2) layer on the surface, while Mo atoms regulate electronic conductivity towards OER reduction potential and maintain the structural integrity of CoMoP2. This work not only provides an identified activation mechanism for bimetallic catalysts, but also highlights the high-pressure synthesis as one of the alternative approaches for developing OER catalysts.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000511170800042

According to the previous report that V-O species can promote the dissociation of water in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), we wondered if introduction of V-O species to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst could also enhance water dissociation, and consequently improve the HER performance. To check this assumption, novel Ni/V2O3 composite was prepared. The obtained electrode exhibits excellent performance including much lower overpotential (44 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope value (38 mV dec(-1)) compared to pure Ni and V2O3 electrodes. In addition, the performance of Ni/V2O3 is comparable to commercial Pt/C electrode. V2O3 was proved to increase the Electrochemical Active Surface Area (ECSA) of Ni/V2O3, which is an important reason for the increased HER performance of Ni/V2O3. Besides that, according to the combined results of Temperature-Programed Reduction (TPR) measurement, CO2 Adsorption, Contact Angle test and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation, it is believed that introduction of V2O3 can promote the process of water dissociation as expected, as well as the hydrogen adsorption-desorption, and bubble separation, all of which together improves the HER performance of non-noble metal Ni.

Herein, we demonstrate that efficient binding and reduction of N-2 at low overpotentials can be realized over WO3 with tailored surface oxygen vacancies, as predicted by density functional theory studies and evidenced by an NH3 yield rate of 4.2 mu g(NH3) h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and a faradaic efficiency of 6.8% at -0.12 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode). A high NH3 faradaic efficiency of up to 12.8% is obtained at an overpotential of only 80 mV, which can even be further improved by increasing the electrolyte pH to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. This low-cost metal oxide holds great appeal as one of the most promising electrocatalysts for efficient N-2 fixation.									101	11	0	0	5	0	103			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000474636100093

Developing different methods to control the shape and composition of ZIF is very important for its practical application as catalyst. In recent years, nano-ZIF has been considered an electrode material with excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, which provides a new way to research electrolyzed water. This review focuses on the morphological engineering of the original ZIF-67 and its derivatives (core-shell, hollow, and array structures) through doping (cation doping, anion doping, and co-doping), derivative composition engineering (metal oxide, phosphide, sulfide, selenide, and telluride), and the corresponding single-atom catalysis. Besides, combined with DFT calculations, it emphasizes the in-depth understanding of actual active sites and provides insights into the internal mechanism of enhancing the OER and proposes the challenges and prospects of ZIF-67 based electrocatalysts. We summarize the application of ZIF-67 and its derivatives in the OER for the first time, which has significantly guided research in this field.									10	2	0	0	1	0	11			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000670348400001	34231644

Herein, a new strategy is developed based on a structured precursor to design and fabricate a hierarchical porous nitrogen doped graphene coupled with densely distributed CoO/Co3O4 heterostructure that exhibits outstanding multifunctional activities. With rational hybridization of graphene and bimetallic nanoparticles, the as-obtained NGPC@CoO(x )integrated densely distributed CoO/Co3O4 active nanoparticles to 3D interconnected hierarchical N-doped graphene mesh, which gives rise to a multifaceted capability for electron/ion transfer and redox catalyzing. The NGPC@CoOx possesses excellent durability with a superior E-1/2 of 0.86 V for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and a relatively low potential for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of 1.61 V, and-0.162 V at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, the superior cycling durability and high power density of NGPC@CoOx-based zinc-air batteries (184.4 mW cm(-2)) further confirm the potential application of prototype devices.

In our study, density functional theory (DFT) is used to explore electrocatalytic mechanisms of dual-metal and tri-metal atoms anchored on graphene monolayer coordinated with pyridine nitrogen atoms. The stability of dual-metal and tri-metal sites is evaluated, and the charge redistribution of doped structures is quantitatively studied through Bader charge analysis. Furthermore, several N-doped graphene configurations with excellent bifunctional activities are screened based on the overpotentials in ORR and OER processes. More importantly, the volcano plots are constructed using appropriate ORR and OER descriptors to analyze and predict catalytic activities of metal/nitrogen co-doped graphene with different configurations. Among them, NiNiCoN9-G has superior bifunctional activities, and the most suitable metal and nitrogen doping association can be predicted. These findings will provide in-sights into the structure-activity relationship and catalytic mechanisms of doped graphene and offer guidelines for future designs of OER/ORR bifunctional electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000860787500002

In this paper, NiOx NPs are successfully synthesized by the self-assembly of Ni precursor onto polyethylenimine functionalized carbon nanotubes (PEI-CNTs) assisted with microwave radiation. NiOx NPs with size around 2-3 nm are homogenously dispersed on the PEI-CNTs supports with no aggregation. The electrochemical activity of NiOx NPs on PEI-CNTs, NiOx/PEI-CNTs, as effective electrocatalysts is studied for supercapacitor and oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions. NiOx/PEI-CNTs show a capacitance of 1728 and 1576 F g(-1) based on active material, and 221 and 394 F g-1 based on total catalyst loading on 12.5% and 25% NiOx/PEI-CNTs, respectively, which is substantially higher than 152 F g(-1) of unsupported NiO. The NiOx/PEI-CNTs electrodes exhibit reversible and stale capacitance of similar to 1200 F g(-1) based on active materials after 2000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g(-1). NiOx/PEI-CNTs also exhibit significantly higher activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water electrolysis, achieving a current density of 100 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 0.35 V for 25% NiOx/PEI-CNTs. It is believed that the uniformly dispersed nano-sized NiOx NPs and synergistic effect between the NiOx NPs and PEI-CNTs is attributed to the high electrocatalytic performance of NiOx/PEI-CNTs electrocatalysts. The results demonstrate that NiOx NPs supported on PEI-CNTs are highly effective electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy storage and conversion applications.

Here by using first-principles calculations, we revealed the catalytic mechanism and evaluated the catalytic activity of monolayer germanium monochalcogenides (2D-GeXs, X = S/Se) as cathode catalytic materials. For 2D-GeXs, Li4O4 with a ring-like structure is the final discharge product. The free energy diagram demonstrates that 2D-GeSe is more energetically favorable than 2D-GeS due to its considerably lower oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) overpotential (0.94 V) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential (1.30 V), which originate from its weaker binding with LiO2 and stronger binding with the inserted Li atom. The analyses on electronic properties elucidate that the final product of Li4O4 on 2D-GeSe induces the semiconductor to semi-metal transition. Our results reflect that 2D-GeSe is an excellent candidate as a cathode material in nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries, while 2D-GeS is not appropriate.									30	1	0	0	1	0	30			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000407763700015	28748245

PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5 (PBSCF) double perovskite was adopted due to its flexible electronic structure as well as higher electro catalytic activity. In this study, PBSCF was prepared by the citrate-EDTA method and the optimized amount of PBSCF-Pt/C composite was used as a potential ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalyst in 0.1 M KOH. The optimized composite exhibited excellent OER intrinsic activity with an onset potential of 1.6 V and Tafel slope of 76 mV/dec under O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH. It also exhibited relatively competitive ORR activity with an onset potential of 0.9 V and half-wave potential of 0.78 V. Additionally, Zn-air battery with PBSCF composite catalyst showed relatively good stability. All these results illustrate that PBSCF-Pt/C composite is a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000833138700001

Herein we report the spectroscopic capture of low-spin (S=1/2) Co-IV-oxo species in the presence of redox-inactive metal ions, such as Sc3+, Ce3+, Y3+, and Zn2+, and the investigation of their reactivity in C-H bond activation and sulfoxidation reactions. Theoretical calculations predict that the binding of Lewis acidic metal ions to the cobaltoxo core increases the electrophilicity of the oxygen atom, resulting in the redox tautomerism of a highly unstable [(TAML)Co-III(O-center dot)](2-) species to a more stable [(TAML)Co-IV(O)(Mn+)] core. The present report supports the proposed role of the redox-inactive metal ions in facilitating the formation of high-valent metal-oxo cores as a necessary step for oxygen evolution in chemistry and biology.									110	1	0	0	27	0	110			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000342760700021	25081948

A new tubular -MnO2 material prepared by a simple hydrothermal synthesis is an efficient electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The synthesized -MnO2 exhibits a unique tubular structure, in which the porous walls are composed of highly dispersed ultrathin -MnO2 nanosheets. Such a unique structure and its intrinsic catalytic activity provide the right electrocatalyst characteristics for high-performance Li-O-2 batteries. As a consequence, suppressed overpotentialsespecially the oxygen evolution reaction overpotentialsuperior rate capability, and desirable cycle life are achieved with these submicron -MnO2 tubes as the electrocatalyst. Remarkably, the discharge product Li2O2 of the Li-O-2 battery exhibits a uniform nanosheet-like morphology, which indicates the critical role of the -MnO2 in the electrochemical process, and a mechanism is proposed to analyze the catalysis of -MnO2.									42	4	0	0	1	0	42			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000355839300019	25944388

Metal-organic framework (MOF) derived flower-shaped CoSe2 nanoplates as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions								SUSTAINABLE ENERGY & FUELS				5	19			4992	5000		10.1039/d1se01112j		AUG 2021		OCT 7 2021	2021	The development of a non-precious metal-based stable and cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst remains a significant challenge for the production of hydrogen (H-2) and oxygen (O-2) through water splitting. Although some progress has been made to develop efficient electrocatalysts from transition metal-based nanostructured selenides, the electrocatalyst derived from metal-organic framework (MOF) transition metal selenides demands additional effort due to their well-defined morphological structure and high accessible surface area resulting in better electrochemical performances. Herein, by tuning the selenylation technique through a facile solvothermal approach, we have successfully synthesized flower-like CoSe2 nanoplates termed MOF-D CoSe2, derived from a Co-MOF of the formula [Co-3(tiron-bpy)(2)(bpy)(H2O)(8)]center dot(H2O)(2) [tiron = 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonate disodium salt, and bpy = 4,4 '-bipyridyl]. The MOF-D CoSe2 performs as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst, which requires an overpotential of 320 mV to achieve the predefined current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). For the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), MOF-D CoSe2 needs an overpotential of 195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1) in an acidic medium of 0.5 M H2SO4. The enhanced bifunctional electrochemical performance of the MOF-D CoSe2 electrocatalyst has been attributed to the combination of a unique flower-shaped morphology with a plate-like nanoarchitecture, higher electrochemical active surface area and robust stability in both acidic as well as alkaline media.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000698200900001

Also, the catalyst performance and stability are greatly limited by cationic dissolution, ripening, or crystal migration in a catalytic system. Here we employed a widely used technique to fabricate heteroepitaxial pyrite selenide through dual-cation substitution and a boron dopant to achieve better activity and stability. The overpotential of Ni-pyrite selenide catalyst is decreased from 543 mV to 279.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope from 161 to 59.5 mV dec(-1). Our theoretical calculations suggest both cation and boron doping can effectively optimize adsorption energy of OER intermediates, promote the charge transfer among the heteroatoms, and improve their OER property. This work underscores the importance of modulating surface electronic structure with the use of multiple elements and provides a general guidance on the minimization of activity loss with valence engineering.									38	2	0	0	3	0	38			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000492801600057	31545026

Hydrogen underpotential deposition and carbon monoxide oxidation are typically used to evaluate iridium (Ir) surface areas, but are ineffective on oxides and can be sensitive to surface oxides formed on Ir metals. Mercury underpotential deposition is presented in this study as an alternative, able to produce reasonable surface areas on Ir and Ir oxide nanoparticles, and able to produce similar surface areas prior to and following characterization in oxygen evolution. Reliable electrochemical surface areas allow for comparative studies of different catalyst types and the characterization of advanced oxygen evolution catalysts. They also enable the study of catalyst degradation in durability testing, both areas of increasing importance within electrolysis and electrocatalysis. (C) The Author(s) 2016. Published by ECS.

However, the synthesis of these films is not trivial because Pb and Co are known to be immiscible metals. Thus, with the aim of understanding the process behind the formation of Pb-Co films, full structural characterization of such films is done. Moreover, to ease the electrodeposition of the films, ascorbic acid is used as a complexing agent. Various concentrations of ascorbic acid were studied. The sample grown in the presence of 90 mM showed the most compact morphology, free of voids and cracks. Further, the analysis of polarization curves revealed that this coating is the best suited as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, allowing operation at a lower overpotential compared to that of conventional Pb-Ca-Sn anodes. The structure of the samples was studied employing X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). It was encountered that the obtained coatings were composed of nanocrystallites of lead immersed in a pseudo-amorphous matrix of lead and cobalt. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, the amorphous nature of the matrix was demonstrated. This nanocrystalline nature favors the electrocatalytic activity of the coating as every point in the surface of the electrode (anode) acts as a catalyst.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1044-5803	1873-4189		WOS:000458228100037

Herein, potato chip-like cobalt nickel-layered double hydroxide@polypyrrole-cotton pad (CoNi-LDH@PCPs) composite was synthesized by in situ polymerization, which was coupled with facile solution reaction and ion-exchange etching process. An interesting potato chip-like structure can effectively expedite the kinetics of the electrode reactions, while the three-dimensional PCPs texture affords efficient pathways for charge transport, and the voids between adjacent fibers are thoroughly accessible for electrolytes and bubble evolution. When evaluated as a positive electrode for wearable supercapattery, the hierarchical CoNi-LDH@PCPs electrode displayed high specific capacity and excellent flexibility. As an oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, this PCP-based electrode also reveals the lowest overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of similar to 58 mV dec(-1). In addition, density functional theory calculations suggest that the synthesis strategy for controllable tuning of hollow CoNi-LDH arrays reported here represents a critical step toward high-performance electrodes for energy storage and electrochemical catalysis.									105	6	0	0	3	0	106			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000492801600129	31536322

An oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) becomes essential in order to perform this process with higher efficiency. Herein, we report the physical, optical and electrochemical characterization of multilayer Ni/Fe thin films as earth-abundant OEC, to avoid the use of platinum group metals (PGM). Uniform films of thicknesses ranging from 1 to 10 nm were fabricated by sequential and alternate thermal evaporation of Ni and Fe. It was found that the successive deposition allows the fabrication of a Ni terminated surface that does not need activation due to the Fe underlayer. The lowest overpotential achieved for NiFe was 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec(-1) with 1 nm thickness and 95% transmittance. Finally, NiFe OEC was implemented on top of Mo: BiVO4 photoanodes which resulted in a reduction of the open circuit potential of 0.2 V and up to five fold increase of the oxidation efficiency at 0.7 V-RHE. The results presented facilitate the practical implementation of BiVO4 photoanodes in tandem configuration for bias free photo-assisted water splitting.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000395922900001

Namely, degradation of carbon supported Pt particles is dramatically influenced by the unwanted ORR enrolling at the anode due to the air penetration during start-up/shut-down events. We present an organic matrix tris(aza)pentacene (TAP), which belongs to p-functional materials with ladder-like conjugated nitrogen-containing units, as the support for Pt to form a "smart" fuel cell anode able to selectively catalyze HOR and to suppress ORR. "Switching-on/off" of the composite material activity is provided by reversible reduction/oxidation of the TAP in the low potential region which provokes TAP - H(x)TAP transition. Conductivity of the reduced H(x)TAP enables supported Pt particles to effectively run HOR. In contrast, restricted conductivity of oxidized TAP analogue leads to the substantial drop in the ORR activity with respect to benchmark Pt/C catalyst. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

By tuning the molar ratio of phosphorus and boron sources in reactants, outstanding bi-functional catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be obtained with an extremely low onset overpotential of 50 mV and a small Tafel slope of 68 mV dec(-1), as well as for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with onset overpotential of 168 mV and a Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1) in neutral solution (pH = 7.0). The improved performance could be due to the high specific area, efficient electron transfer and the synergistic effects of P and B. We also tested these catalysts in seawater for both OER and HER, which showed favorable activities. This approach to form 2D structures on a reduced graphene oxide may inspire the development of more extraordinary electrochemical catalysts and devices.									80	3	0	0	1	0	82			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000344380000036

Herein, 3D heteromorphic NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 nanosheets network has been constructed on Ni foam (denoted as NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF) serving as a self-standing electrocatalyst through directly thermal sulfurization of a single-source NiCo-layered double hydroxide precursor. The resultant NiCo2S4/Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic HER performance with an extremely low onset overpotential of 15 mV and long-term durability in alkaline solution. Such enhanced HER performance can be credited to (1) the massive exposed active sites provided by mixed transition metal chalcogenides (NiCo2S4 and Ni3S2), (2) the strong interfacial interaction at NiCo2S4/Ni3S2 heterojunction interfaces with the strengthened H binding, and (3) the porous highly conductive Ni foam substrate with accelerated electron transfer. This work opens up a new direction to fabricate effective and non-noble-metal electrodes for water splitting and hydrogen generation.									110	3	0	0	5	0	112			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000429625400032	29554429

However, especially N- and S-co-doped catalysts reach highest activity, but it remains unclear if the activity is related to MNx or MSy (M=metal) sites. In this work we apply a simple method for multi-heteroatom doping and investigate the effect of cobalt content on the HER in acidic medium. The CoNx and CoSy sites were evidenced on the basis of structural characterization by Raman, X-ray induced photoelectron spectroscopy, and TEM. The presence of sulfur enables the formation of a larger number of CoNx sites. Structure-performance relationship proves that the HER activity is dominated by CoNx rather than CoSy sites. The most active catalysts also exhibit an excellent stability under galvanostatic conditions making them of interest for electrolyser application.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000442846800005	29862591

However, there are still many speculations regarding the actual role of the cocatalyst. Now a photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction pathway is reported on a cocatalyst site using TiO2 nanosheets doped with Rh at Ti sites as one-atom cocatalysts. A hydride species adsorbed on the one-atom Rh dopant cocatalyst site was confirmed experimentally as the intermediate state for hydrogen evolution, which was consistent with the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this system, the role of the cocatalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is related to the withdrawal of photo-excited electrons and stabilization of the hydride intermediate species; the presence of oxygen vacancies induced by Rh facilitate the withdrawal of electrons and stabilization of the hydride.									47	2	0	0	2	0	47			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000438195200050	29766627

However, it achieves a photocurrent which is much lower than the theoretical value of 7.5 mA cm(-2). Herein we prepare a multimetal oxide-based heterojunction W:BiVO4-FeCoW by a sol-gel approach with post-annealing. The heterojunction photoanode exhibits a photocurrent which is enhanced to approximate to 3.8 times that of a W:BiVO4 photoanode at 1.23 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a significant negative shift of the flat-band potential of 280 mV. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance enhancement mechanism can be attributed to the significantly enhanced charge separation/transport and light absorption due to the multimetal oxide-modified heterojunction.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2398-4902			WOS:000443282700013

In this work, we successfully establish an effective experimental protocol to quantify the intrinsic performance of OER catalysts in a standard thinfilm rotating-(ring)-disk-electrode system. Furthermore, a new insight into the electric double layer (EDL) microstructure is gained to illustrate all experimental observations in alkaline media. The results indicate that IrO2 has 2.6-times higher activity than NiCo2O4, due to the improved reaction kinetics, charge transfer and O-2-transport occurring in the EDL. However, after 10 000 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV), NiCo2O4 shows much higher stability due to continuous EDL structural modifications. In particular, it is revealed that the EDL charging process, accompanied by the electrocatalytic OER, has a strong effect on catalyst-electrolyte interfacial behaviors, which, in turn, determine the accuracy of electrochemical measurement results. It is further found that the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) obtained from traditional CV measured capacitance cannot accurately reflect the actual reaction sites of various catalysts during the OER. This discrepancy exists mainly because of the EDL capacitance, which is referred to as the inner capacitance caused by less accessible active sites. Alternatively, a novel method based on in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has demonstrated improved accuracy in obtaining potential-dependent ECSAs, comparable to ex situ Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area measurements.									121	4	0	0	6	0	121			2398-4902			WOS:000424001700024

However, many MOFs are shown to be sensitive to aqueous solution. This severely limits application of MOFs in electrocatalytic operations for energy production and storage. Here, a Co (II) boron imidazolate framework CoB(im)(4)(ndc)(0.5)(BIF-91, im = imidazolate, ndc = 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate) that is rationally designed and successfully tested for electrocatalytic application in strong alkaline (pH approximate to 14) solution is reported. In such a BIF system, the inherent carboxylate species segment large channel spaces into multiple domains in which each single channel is filled with ndc ligands through the effect of zeolite channel confinement. These ligands, with strong C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interaction, act as a rigid auxiliary linker to significantly enhance the structural stability of the BIF-91 framework. Additionally, the pi-conjugated effect in BIF-91 stabilizes dopant Fe (III) at the atomic scale to construct Fe-immobilized BIF-91 (Fe@BIF-91). Due to the synergistic effect between Fe (III) guest and Co (II) in the framework, the Fe@BIF-91 acts as an active and stable electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solution.									28	1	0	0	2	0	28				2198-3844		WOS:000467524500017	31065521

Herein, a homogeneous structure (denoted as Co/Ce-Ni3S2/NF) composed of Co and Ce dual doped Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam was synthesized by a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Co and Ce dopants are distributed inside the host sulfide, thereby raising the active sites and the electrical conductivity. Besides, the CeOx nanoparticles generated by part of the Ce dopants as a cocatalyst further improve the catalytic activity by adding defective sites and enhancing the electron transfer. As a consequence, the obtained Co/Ce-Ni3S2/NF electrode exhibits better electrocatalytic activity than single Co or Ce doped Ni3S2 and pure Ni3S2, with low overpotential (286 mV) at 20 mA-cm(-2), a small Tafel slope and excellent long-term durability in strong alkaline solution. These results presented here not only offer a novel platform for designing transition metal and lanthanide dual-doped catalysts, but also supply some guidelines for constructing catalysts in other catalytic applications.									42	3	0	0	1	0	42			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000531780700011

While many first-row transition metal oxides are competitive in alkaline media, most of them just dissolve or become inactive at high proton concentrations where hydrogen evolution is preferred. Only noble-metal catalysts, such as IrO2, are fast and stable enough in acidic media. Herein, we report the excellent activity and long-term stability of Co3O4-based anodes in 1 M H2SO4 (pH 0.1) when processed in a partially hydrophobic carbon-based protecting matrix. These Co3O4@C composites reliably drive O-2 evolution a 10 mA cm(-2) current density for >40 h without appearance of performance fatigue, successfully passing benchmarking protocols without incorporating noble metals. Our strategy opens an alternative venue towards fast, energy efficient acid-media water oxidation electrodes.While water electrolysis offers a renewable way to produce hydrogen, there are few Earth-abundant, acid-stable water oxidation catalysts. Here, authors show Co3O4, when protected by a partially hydrophobic environment, to sustain 40 h activity without structural or chemical transformations.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000831732000001	35896541

The realization of large-scale water splitting, however, is mainly impeded by its slow kinetics, particularly because of its sluggish anodic half reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), whose product O-2 is ironically not of high value. In fact, the co-production of H-2 and O-2 in conventional water electrolysis may result in the formation of explosive H-2/O-2 gas mixtures due to gas crossover and reactive oxygen species (ROS); both pose safety concerns and shorten the lifetimes of water splitting cells. With these considerations in mind, replacing the OER with thermodynamically more favorable organic oxidation reactions is much more preferred, which will not only substantially reduce the voltage input for H-2 evolution from water and avoid the generation of H-2/O-2 gas mixtures and ROS, but also possibly lead to the co-production of value-added organic products on the anode. Indeed, such an innovative strategy for H2 production integrated with valuable organic oxidation has attracted increasing attention in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. This feature article showcases the most recent examples along this endeavor. As exemplified in the main text, the oxidative transformation of a variety of organic substrates, including alcohols, ammonia, urea, hydrazine, and biomass-derived intermediate chemicals, can be integrated with energy-efficient H2 evolution. We specifically highlight the importance of oxidative biomass valorization coupled with H2 production, as biomass is the only green carbon source whose scale is comparable to fossil fuels. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities are also discussed.									91	2	0	0	3	0	91			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000434679500002	29761801

Herein, we report an ultrafast one-step electrodeposition method to prepare a series of transition metal foams within one minute for electrocatalytic water splitting. The porous metal foams not only possess unique 3D channels for rapid electrolyte diffusion and gas releasing, but also have robust integrated structures with enhanced conductivity for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the NiCo and NiFe foams only require 86 and 206 mV to output 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in 1 M KOH, respectively. Combining the two electrocatalysts, we have assembled an outstanding alkaline electrolyzer, requiring only 1.52 and 1.64 V to deliver 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) respectively, outperforming the RuO2(+)//Pt/C(-) electrolyzer. Our study offers an ultrafast and general approach to fabricate 3D porous electrocatalysts for high-performance water splitting.									46	0	0	0	3	0	45			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000632996000002

Understanding oxygen chemistry on oxide materials is significantly more complicated than studying transition-metal catalysts for two reasons: the most stable surface coverage under reaction conditions is extremely important but difficult to understand without many detailed calculations, and there are many possible active sites and configurations on O*- or OH*-covered surfaces. We have developed an automated and high-throughput approach to solve this problem and predict OER overpotentials for arbitrary oxide surfaces. We demonstrate this for a number of previously unstudied IrO2 and IrO3 polymorphs and their facets. We discovered that low-index surfaces of IrO2 other than rutile (110) are more active than the most stable rutile (110), and we identified promising active sites of IrO2 and IrO3 that outperform rutile (110) by 0.2 V in theoretical overpotential. On the basis of findings from DFT calculations, we provide catalyst design strategies to improve the catalytic activity of Ir-based catalysts and demonstrate a machine learning model capable of predicting surface coverages and site activity.

Here, we report a high performance core-shell-structured nitrogen-doped CoCx/FeCo@C/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrid, which is derived from Fe-doped Co-3[Co(CN)(6)](2) MOFs, as bifunctional catalysts for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Structure characterizations show that the carbon shell of CoCx/FeCo and graphene support are bonded to each other, which offer a large surface area and stable anchoring sites for the CoCx/FeCo. Electrochemical tests show that N-doped CoCx/FeCo@C/rGO hybrid exhibits superior onset potential (1.0183 V vs RHE), half-wave potential (0.9653 V vs RHE), peak current intensity (0.9233 mA/cm(-2)) and long-term durability for ORR than those of Pt/C (onset potential, half-wave potential and peak current intensity are 1.0174 V and 0.9213 V, 0.8233 mA/cm(-2), respectively) in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The overpotential of the hybrid for OER is only similar to 390 mV at a current intensity of 10 mA/cm(-2), which is close to that of the RuO2. The excellent electrocatalytic properties of this hybrid make it a great potential to be substitute for precious-based catalysts for ORR and OER in fuel cells and water splitting.

Herein, we report the fabrication of a cost-effective electrocatalyst consisting of FeCoNiP alloy nanoparticles that are integrated on vertically aligned phosphorus-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (VPSWCNTs) on Au electrode (FeCoNiP/VPSWCNTs/Au). The catalyst exhibited excellent catalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (overpotential of 147 mV and Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (overpotential of 280 mV and Tafel slope of 43 mV dec(-1)) with the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). FeCoNiP/VPSWCNTs/Au exhibited good stability and activity for at least 10 h. These results indicate that FeCoNiP/VPSWCNTs/Au can be used as a cost-effective and earth-abundant non-noble-metal efficient catalyst for overall water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000546926400001		
J	Mitrovski, S; Drazic, DM								Oxygen evolution at La1-xBaxCoO3 perovskite-type electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE SERBIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				63	7			555	564						1998	1998	Perovskite oxides of the type La1-xBaxCoO3 (x = 0.1, 0.2, 0.4) and La0.8Ca0.2CoO3 were synthesized and tested as oxygen anodes in 1 mol dm(-3) NaOH solution at room temperature. The electrodes were prepared by pressing and sintering the synthesized perovskite powders. The roughness factors of the electrodes were determined by Hg-porosimetry and by double layer capacitance measurements. The ones determined by Hg-porosimetry, rs, were found to be in the range 42<r(s)<1500, while the ones determined from the double layer capacitance; r(DL), were found to be in the range 11<r(DL)<470. No correlation between the composition of the oxides and the roughness factors was found, whereas the ratio r(DL)/r(s) remained approximately constant and amounted to around 0.3 (+/-10%) for all the electrodes. The behaviour of the electrodes in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied. All the electrodes showed Tafel slopes of about 60 mV dec(-1), whereas the activity in the OER, expressed using the corresponding roughness factors, increased with increasing x and was almost one order of magnitude higher for the Ba- than the Ca-substituted perovskite, for the same degree of substitution, x = 0.2. The enhanced activity of the perovskites with higher Ba content was attributed to the higher Co4+ ions content, together with the higher specific activity of these active centres for the OER, determined by cyclic voltammetry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0352-5139			WOS:000074807300008

The catalytic effects on both Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) are evaluated by the onset potentials of the voltammetric curves, and the number of electrons involved in ORR is evaluated by the Levich plot. Tafel plots of both OER and ORR curves obtained after the activation protocol show significant changes that rule out the hypothesis that the catalytic effect could only be attributed to an increased roughness of the samples. Furthermore, the electrochemically active surface area of silver, as measured by the charge involved in Pb underpotential deposition, was found to increase linearly with the amount of depositing silver. On the contrary, the Tafel plots of increasing amounts of silver show that the increase of the catalytic effect with silver loading is not linear as expected in a mere increase of the roughness factor. Levich-Koutecky and Tafel plots evidenced that the highest silver loading showed a catalytic effect greater than that expected on the basis of the electrochemically active surface area.

J	Siess, L								Evolution of massive AGB stars - I. Carbon burning phase								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				448	2			717	729		10.1051/0004-6361:20053043				MAR 2006	2006	We present new computations of the evolution of solar metallicity stars in the mass range 9-12 M.. This first paper of a series focuses on the propagation of the carbon burning flame front and provides a detailed analysis of the structural evolution up to the formation of the neon-oxygen core. Our calculations which do not include overshooting indicate that off-center carbon ignition is restricted to a small mass range between 9.0 and 11.3 M.. The chemical imprints of the first and second dredge-ups on the surface composition are analyzed and compared to "standard" less massive stars. It results that, aside from being more luminous and slightly bluer in the HR diagram, massive AGB stars are almost indistinguishable from their lower mass counterparts, as far as the chemical composition is concerned. During the second dredge-up, we note however that the envelope penetrates deeper into the He burning shell than lower mass stars. Our simulations indicate that above similar to 11.0 M., the depth of the second dredge up is considerably reduced, marking the transition between low and massive stars. We also investigate the effects of the nuclear uncertainties associated with C-12 + C-12 reactions and show that it has a little impact on the core composition. Finally we describe the nucleosynthesis and chemical structure of the newly formed neon-oxygen core.									164	1	0	0	1	0	164			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000235777700039

Herein, a general strategy combining sol-gel and a carbonization-assisted route was proposed to facilely fabricate a series of TMP nanoparticles, including CoP, MoP, FeP, Cu2P, Ni2P, PtP2, FeNiP, CoNiP, and FeCoNiP, coupled in an amorphous carbon matrix with one-step carbon composite formation. The resultant NiFeP@C exhibits excellent activities as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with low overpotentials of 260 and 160 mV, respectively, at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH solution. With the NiFeP@C electrocatalyst as both electrode materials, an integrated electrolyzer can deliver 47.0 mA/cm(2) of current density at 1.60 V, better than the assembled Pt/C20 parallel to IrO2 counterpart. The encapsulation of NiFeP nanoparticles in the carbon matrix effectively prevents their corrosion and leads to almost unfading catalytic activities for more than 20 h for either the HER, OER, or overall water splitting, outperforming recently reported bifunctional electrocatalysts. The coexistence of Ni, Fe, P, and C would have synergetic effects to accelerate charge transfer and promote electrocatalytic activity. This universal strategy for TMP-based composites opens up a new avenue to explore TMPs as multifunctional materials for various applications.									57	3	0	0	1	0	58			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000529924800022	32242652

An efficient catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key factor for high-performance Li-O-2 cells. In this work, a unique design of catalytic cathode composed of black phosphorus quantum dots-decorated delta-MnO2 nanobelts (BPQD/delta-MnO2) on carbon cloth is proposed. The thin belt-like architecture of delta-MnO2 and porous structure of the catalytic cathode not only provide numerous catalytic sites for ORR/OER but also facilitate transportation of the reactants and deposition of the discharge product. The synergic effect of delta-MnO2 and BPQD enables discrete growth of thin Li2O2 sheets on delta-MnO2, leading to high capacity (8463 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)) and long cycle life (182 cycles at 400 mA g(-1) with a limited capacity of 1000 mAhg(-1)) of the cells. Density functional theory calculations support that Li2O2 favors conformal growth on delta-MnO2 in the presence of BPQD.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2405-8297			WOS:000495867200068

Herein, we report a unique hierarchical nanosheet-nanowire structure of a CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst directly grown on conductive nickel foam (NF) by optimizing the hydrothermal temperature of the reaction. The hydrothermal temperature is decisive in driving the formation of the wire-in-sheet morphology of CoFe-LDH, while the hydrothermal time has almost no effect on the morphology of the electrocatalyst. The possible mechanism of the morphological evolution has been proposed. The wire-in-sheet nanoarray of CoFe-LDH provides a higher number of active sites, more intricate transmission networks and improved electronic conductivity, resulting in enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Consequently, the resultant CoFe-LDH exhibits superior OER performance: a low overpotential of 242 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) (eta = 242 mV@100 mA cm(-2)), with an exceedingly small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), as well as an ultra-long durability (97 h) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. Therefore, the design of a unique hierarchical nanostructure by tuning the reaction conditions may open up a new avenue for high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000728258800001	34881382

However, the instability of the OOH* intermediate and high energy barrier for the rate-determining step (RDS) (O* to OOH*) on the pure bimetallic-alloy represent serious challenges. Here, we report atomically dispersed Ru single-atoms on a cobalt-iron bimetallic-alloy encapsulated by graphitic carbon (RuSACoFe2/G) as an efficient and durable electrocatalyst for the alkaline OER. In-depth X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy (AC-TEM) along with theoretical calculations were employed to validate the isolated Ru sites in the surface-oxygen rich alloy. RuSACoFe(2)/G displays exceptional intrinsic activity, achieving a record low overpotential of only 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with superior durability in alkali media. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations revealed that the isolated Ru sites with pre-adsorbed surface oxygen species on a bimetallic-alloy efficiently stabilize the OOH* intermediate and significantly reduce the energy barrier for the RDS, boosting the intrinsic OER activity. Our integrated alkaline electrolyzer demands a low cell voltage of 1.48 V at 10 mA cm(-2), suggesting that it has potential for use in practical applications.									48	0	0	0	3	0	48			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100042

Here, we report a straightforward one-step strategy to construct hollow bimetallic CoFe-PBA. The morphology evolution process is carefully investigated as a function of aging time and relative reactant ratio, proving that the Co2+-to-[Fe(CN)(6)](3-) (Co/Fe) ratio is crucial for obtaining the hollow structure, which is revealed as an orientated dissolution- recrystallization process driven by supersaturation. The hollow CoFe-PBA acts as an ideal precursor for the derived synthesis of ternary Co-Fe-P, which provides promising performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, with a low eta(10) = 235 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1). This study proposes a new method for the design and construction of hollow PBAs for further conversion into highly efficient catalyst materials.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			2168-0485			WOS:000509432200064

Aromatic hydroxylation metabolites of pharmaceuticals may be obtained through various synthetic and enzymatic methods Electrochemical oxidation is an alternative with advantages in terms of mild reaction conditions and less hazardous chemicals. In the present study, we report that aromatic hydroxylation metabolites of lidocaine can be readily obtained electrochemically under aqueous acidic conditions at platinum electrodes. Our results show that the dominant N-deallcylation reaction can be suppressed by decreasing the solution pH below 0.5 resulting in selective 3-hydroxylidocaine, which is an in vivo metabolite of lidocaine. Experiments in O-18 labelled water indicated that water is the primary source of oxygen, while dissolved molecular oxygen contributes to a minor extent to the hydroxylation reaction.

In this study, carbon-coated MnCo2O4 nanowire (MnCo2O4@C) is prepared by a self-template method from MnCo2-NTA nanowire precursor. MnCo2O4@C shows excellent electrocatalytic performance and improved circulation stability, with an onset potential of 0.92 V and current retention rate of 99% within 10000 s at 0.80 V vs. RHE, better than the commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 0.94 V, current retention rate 94%). Further study shows that the oxygen reduction mechanism of MnCo2O4@C follows quasi-four-electron transfer process. The carbon provides conductive network and promotes the fast transfer of electrons in between the carbon network and MnCo2O4 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, under the limitation of rigid carbon shell, the growth of MnCo2O4 nanoparticle is impeded. These make MnCo2O4@C excellent electrochemical properties, and endow rechargeable Zn-air battery with high open-circuit voltage of 1.43 V and long-term cycling performance over 70 h with high efficiency and stability. MnCo2O4@C holds great promise as highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst in the practical application of rechargeable metal-air batteries and other fuel cells.									31	2	0	0	1	0	31			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000474502800004

In particular, new Ir precursors with high reactivity at a suitable low temperature are essentially required. In this study, we report a novel ALD precursor with improved reactivity by introducing a cyclopropenyl ligand. (C18H27IrO3 or TICP) is used as an ALD precursor with molecular O2 as a reactant. Ir films are grown by ALD on a Si substrate at deposition temperatures ranging from 200 to 325 degrees C, and an ALD window of 250-275 degrees C and self-limiting growth at a rate of 0.52 A cycle-1 at 250 degrees C are observed. The negligible O impurity content (<2 at. %) and low resistivity (13 mu Omega cm) indicate that pure metallic Ir films are formed. The differential delay of nucleation depending on the substrate surface is explained in terms of the dominant surface functional group, indicating possible application of the current ALD process toward area-selective deposition of Ir. Density functional theory calculations show that the adsorption of the Ir precursor is feasible on Si and Ru but is unfavorable on hydroxyl-terminated SiO2. Ru is adopted as the seed layer for conformal deposition on a SiO2 trench, and a step coverage of similar to 100% is obtained. Finally, an Ir thin film grown on a threedimensional titanium substrate shows overpotentials (at 10 mA cm-2) of similar to 65 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and similar to 336 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction in an acid electrolyte, which suggest its potential application as a water-splitting catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000812175900001

Cocatalysts could lower the activation potential for O-2 evolution. However, the cocatalyst for O-2 evolution has been less investigated, and few effective cocatalysts were reported. This paper reports that the O-2 evolution rate of photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation can be significantly enhanced when the electrocatalyst cobalt phosphate (denoted as CoPi) was deposited on BiVO4. The photocurrent density is also greatly enhanced by loading CoPi on BiVO4 electrode, and this enhancement in performance shows the similar trend between the photocatalytic activity and photocurrent density. We also found that this tendency is true for BiVO4 loaded with a series of different electrocatalysts as the cocatalysts. These results demonstrate that an effective electrocatalyst of water oxidation can be also an effective cocatalyst for O-2 evolution from photocatalytic water oxidation. By depositing the CoPi as the oxidation cocatalyst and Pt as the reduction cocatalyst on an yttrium-doped BiVO4 (Bi0.5Y0.5VO4), overall water splitting reaction to H-2 and O-2 was realized. Our work also reveals the essential relations between photocatalysis and electrocatalysis in water splitting reaction.									330	15	0	0	22	2	336			1932-7447			WOS:000300911600021

Herein, we report a rational design of novel CoS2 nanotube arrays assembled on a flexible support which can be directly utilized as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. Uniform wire-like metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoarrays were first fabricated and a sulfidation process by thermal treatment was carried out to transform the MOF arrays into CoS2 nanotube arrays. The unique hollow CoS2 tubular arrays are shown to provide high surface area for an efficient electrochemical reaction, and the well-defined electrical/mechanical connection to the substrate enhances both mass and electron transfer. The CoS2 nanotube arrays exhibited a high electrochemical activity in catalyzing both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, in terms of low onset potential, high current density and excellent stability. Using the CoS2 nanotube arrays as catalysts, a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution is achieved with a cell voltage of 1.67 V, and the stable current can be maintained for 20 h even when the electrode is in a bent state.									198	8	0	0	10	0	203			2055-6756	2055-6764		WOS:000413434500005	32260664

If the Earth's D" layer between core and mantle is the waste product of this reaction proceeding forward with oxygen transfer to the core, then D" would form an effective lid preventing escape of siderophile elements from the core. On the other hand, it is at least as plausible that the core is now oxygen saturated and that core cooling and internal crystallization drive this reaction backward with transfer of Fe- and O- rich material out of the core into D". The Os-186 anomalies in some plume basalts are more consistent with this D" as a siderophile element pump scenario than the D" as-lid scenario. Contributions of siderophile elements to the mantle from the core could assist in balancing the persistently enigmatic budget of these elements.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1525-2027			WOS:000179456400001

However, the large basal plane areas of the CoO2 slabs show too strong adsorption energy to the reaction intermediates, which is unfavorable for the release of O-2. Here, a simple cation-exchange strategy based on Fe3+ and alkali ions is proposed to simultaneously activate both the basal plane and edge sites of A(x)CoO(2) for the OER. X-ray absorption spectroscopy has revealed that the Fe3+ ions deposit both on the surface and edge sites of the CoO2 slabs and enter the interlayer. The cation-exchanged A(x)CoO(2) electrodes show a boosted activity compared to their pristine and conventional Fe-doped A(x)CoO(2) counterparts. This phenomenon is mainly ascribed to the abundant edge-sharing Co-Fe motifs at the edge sites and the charge redistribution in the basal plane sites induced by the insertion of Fe3+ ions. This work provides a novel method to fully exploit layer-structured materials for efficient energy conversion.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000670516000001

The BPC synthesis is based on simple CO2 carbonization using NaBH4 as a reducing agent with subsequent thermal treatments. Electrochemical, microscopic and spectroscopic measurements with density functional calculations reveal that the presence of oxidized boron atoms (O-B-C species) in the B-C bonding is responsible for the enhanced ORR activity, preferential 4 electron pathway, and high cycle stability.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000350886600013

Approaching the evolutionary advantage of ancillary types of haemoglobin in Daphnia magna by simulation of oxygen supply								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				213	3			408	417		10.1242/jeb.031914				FEB 1 2010	2010	The planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna synthesizes haemoglobin (Hb) macromolecules of variant subunit composition and oxygen affinity. This is one of the strategies by which the animals cope with variations in environmental conditions such as ambient oxygen tension. The enrichment of high-affinity Hb molecules in the haemolymph of hypoxia-exposed animals is thought to reduce Hb synthesis costs due to an enhanced transport efficiency of these molecules in comparison to the low-affinity Hb molecules. How great this economic advantage is, and under which conditions this benefit disappears, is still not fully understood. Here we implemented a rigorously simplified model of the daphnid body and described the transport of oxygen from the environment via the haemolymph to the tissues in terms of the convection-diffusion-reaction equation. The model was validated by comparing various model predictions with experimental data. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the influence of parameter uncertainties on the model predictions. Cost-benefit analysis revealed in which way at the system's level the increase in Hb oxygen affinity improves the oxygen loading at the respiratory surfaces and impairs the release of oxygen to the tissues. The benefit arising from the improved oxygen loading exceeds the disadvantage of impaired unloading only under conditions where the ambient oxygen tension is critically low and the Hb concentration is high. The low-affinity Hb, on the other hand, provides an advantage given that the Hb concentration is low and the ambient oxygen tension is well above the critical level. Computer-aided modelling and simulation therefore provide valuable mechanistic insights into the driving forces that could have shaped the evolution of globin genes in daphnids.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000273720700011	20086125

However, the sluggish-kinetics and low value-added anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) restricts the overall energy conversion efficiency. Herein we report a strategy of boosting H-2 production at low voltages by replacing OER with a bioelectrochemical cascade reaction at a triphase bioanode. In the presence of oxygen, oxidase enzymes can convert biomass into valuable products, and concurrently generate H2O2 that can be further electrooxidized at the bioanode. Benefiting from the efficient oxidase kinetics at an oxygen-rich triphase bioanode and the more favorable thermodynamics of H2O2 oxidation than that of OER, the cell voltage and energy consumption are reduced by similar to 0.70 V and similar to 36%, respectively, relative to regular water electrolysis. This leads to an efficient H-2 production at the cathode and valuable product generation at the bioanode. Integration of a bioelectrochemical cascade into the water splitting process provides an energy-efficient and promising pathway for achieving a renewable fuel. (C) 2020 Science China Press.

Intriguingly, Fe3S4@Ni3S2 exhibits low onset potential of 290 mV and overpotential of 360 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). We examined the OER kinetics of Fe3S4@Ni3S2 using distribution function of relaxation times (DFRT), which are attained with the help of impedance spectroscopy genetic programming (ISGP). ISGP reveals the occurrences of three events of OER, manifested as peaks in the DFRT, such as active material or pores (P2), charge transfer (P1'), and production rate of intermediates (P1) in case of Fe3S4@Ni3S2 at different faradic overpotentials. The effective resistance of each phenomenon can be easily calculated. It decreases with an increase in conductivity at high overpotentials for all the three, which suggests the high performance of the as-synthesized composite due to faster kinetics. Further, structural investigation of the catalyst employing x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is elaborated and it is suggested that the catalyst activation takes place by the constant exchange of anions between electrode and electrolyte during electrochemical oxidation.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2196-0216			WOS:000600776800001

In this work, it has been found that when these systems are irradiated with light of different wavelengths, their electrocatalytic responses change in terms of overpotential and photocurrent. Thus, the electroactivity of these systems towards hydrogen evolution reaction can be enhanced by irradiation at certain wavelength with no requirement of a photosensitizer. Interestingly, the largest enhancement of this reaction is observed at wavelengths corresponding to specific arrangement of porphyrins on the electrode. Cyclic voltammetry, photo-electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and UV-visible spectroscopy studies were done in order to corroborate and discuss this effect. Finally, XRD experiments allowed us to confirm the existence of highly ordered arrangement in each supramolecular system and that this is a determinant factor in the photoelectrochemical responses.

The supported catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was synthesized by chemical reduction and deposition under ultrasonic dispersion. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals that iridium (Ir) particles with sizes of about 10-40 nm are mainly dispersed on the outside surface of titanium carbide (TiC). The PEMWE using the supported Ir/TiC (40 wt% Ir) as the anode catalyst shows the best performance among the supported catalysts of three different Ir contents. Increasing the cell temperature in the PEMWE can enhance the activity of the catalyst and lower the over-potential of the electrodes, which can improve the performance of the PEMWE. At a cell temperature of 80 degrees C and atmospheric pressure, the current densities of the best PEMWE at the potential of 1.8 and 2.0 V are 1002 and 1736 mA/cm(2), respectively.

Here we have used Tetraselmis algal cells as both a renewable and sustainable carbon source and a biotemplate to synthesize low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) NiFe oxide nanocatalysts. The nanocatalysts were grown on Tetraselmis-derived carbonized cells (cCells), a three-dimensional (3D) carbon scaffold, by two approaches. In the first approach, the catalyst components were loaded on cells prior to carbonization (pre-loading method). The nanocatalysts were then grown by using silica precursor tetramethoxysilane to generate NiFe(OH)(x) @Cell-SiO2 composites. Further pyrolysis produced NiFe oxides on electrically conductive cCells (NiFeOx @cCell). The cCells were reduced graphene oxide with 3D morphology. In the second approach, the cCells were synthesized first, followed by a hydrothermal reaction with the catalyst precursors (post-loading method). In comparison with the pre-loading method, the post-loading method enabled to load more nanocatalysts on individual cCells, which were highly efficient, with OER performance superior to that of the benchmark OER catalyst Ir/C. Our current methods may offer a new opportunity for using microalgae-derived, highly efficient water-splitting nanocatalysts for hydrogen production. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

The potential of Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) for the estimation of the surface electronic structure of electrochemically active interfaces will be described by two examples. Thereto the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over Pt and IrOx anodes will be introduced. In particular the analysis of XP core level spectra of IrOx requires the development of an appropriate fit model. Furthermore the design of reaction cells based on proton exchange membranes (PEM) and on electron transparent graphene membranes, which enables the investigation of liquid-gas and liquid-solid interfaces under electrochemical relevant conditions will be discussed. In the last part of this article a perspective to the EMIL project at the synchrotron radiation facility BESSY will be given. The purpose of this project is the implementation of two new beamlines enabling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy in the X-ray regime from 80 eV-8 keV under reaction conditions. The extension to the so called tender X-ray regime will allow the release of higher kinetic energy photoelectrons which have a higher inelastic mean free path compared to photoelectrons excited by soft X-ray radiation and therefore will enable the investigation of solid-liquid interfaces under electrochemical reaction conditions.

They typically contain graphitic and amorphous domains, both of which contribute to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Here, we aim at revealing the catalytic functions of each domain as well of the surface functional groups, and ultimately at maximizing the catalytic performance of the materials in the ORR. We develop a sequential oxidative-pyrolytic treatment to remove the amorphous domains and to alter the surface functionalities. The effectiveness of this approach is evidenced by various techniques. Our electrochemical results show a positive correlation between the ORR activity and the degree of graphitization/oxygen functional group removal. While the oxidation-induced oxygen-containing group impairs the ORR, the amorphous domains seem facilitate the 2-electron transfer ORR, lack electrical conductivity and are rich in oxygen-containing groups. The ORR activity of the optimized sample increases considerably in the alkaline electrolyte, giving a half-wave potential >0.85 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode) that is comparable to that of commercial platinum on carbon.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			2052-1553			WOS:000503509100014

The morphology, structure and composition of the product were characterized by microscopic analysis, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The architectures exhibited boosted electrocatalytic activity and stability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic and alkaline media. The overpotential of PtCoNi FNs for HER is smaller than the contrast materials (PtCo NPs, PtNi NCs, Pt black and Pt/C) at the fixed current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the correlative exchange current density is significantly enlarged compared with commercial Pt black while comparable to commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). Besides, the catalyst showed the highly boosted catalytic characters for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the more positive onset potential and faster kinetics.

However, the practical application of air-electrodes is impeded by the multistep synthesis and poor flexibility. Herein, metal/nitrogen co-doped carbon nanofiber membranes are synthesized by integrated core-shell electrospun, in which Co-N-4 sites are atomically dispersed in the porous shell and specific carbon nanofibers with super-flexibility form backbones in the core. Owing to a high specific surface area, a 3D porous network structure and atomically dispersed Co-N-4 active sites, as-prepared membranes demonstrate a remarkable bifunctional electrocatalytic performance towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low potential gap of 0.719 V. Furthermore, the flexible Zn-air battery featuring a freestanding air-electrode by as-fabricated membranes displays an outstanding open-circuit voltage (1.461 V), a high peak power density (60.3 mW cm(-2)) and an ultra-narrow and stable discharge-charge voltage gap of 0.61 V under different bending angles, which are among the best values reported for self-supported flexible Zn -air batteries. This work paves a new way to prepare integrated freestanding air-electrodes as power sources for flexible electronic devices.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2405-8297			WOS:000782054800004

Electrochemical water splitting coupling with grid-scale renewable energy harvesting technologies is becoming one of the most promising approaches. Besides, hydrogen with the highest mass-energy density of any fuel is regarded as the ultimate clean energy carrier. The realization of practical water splitting depends heavily on the development of low-cost, highly active, and durable catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Recently, heterostructured catalysts, which are generally composed of electrochemical active materials and various functional additives, have demonstrated extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward HER and OER, and particularly a number of precious-metal-free heterostructures delivered comparable activity with precious-metal-based catalysts. Herein, an overview is presented of recent research progress on heterostructured HER catalysts. It starts with summarizing the fundamentals of HER and approaches for evaluating HER activity. Then, the design and synthesis of heterostructures, electrochemical performance, and the related mechanisms for performance enhancement are discussed. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are highlighted for the development of heterostructured HER catalysts from the points of view of both fundamental understandings and practical applications.									563	33	0	0	17	0	567			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000448258800007

Herein, highly catalytic active atomic Fe sites anchored to hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe-N-x-HCS) have been designed with optimized geometric features by introducing a new Fe-containing ionic liquid followed by a self-sacrificing, template-assisted, and controlled pyrolysis. Morphological and structural characterizations revealed abundant atomic Fe catalytic sites (Fe-N-4 and Fe-3 species) have a homogeneous dispersion throughout the HCS framework, resulting in high catalytic activity. The bifunctional Fe-N-x-HCS electrocatalyst had a more positive half-wave potential, higher diffusion-limiting ORR current density, as well as a lower overpotential for OER in both 0.1 M KOH and 0.05 M H2SO4. The stability of active sites and structural integrity of Fe-Nx-HCS significantly contributed to long-term cycling stability even after 10,000 potential cycles under alkaline conditions. Moreover, a rechargeable zinc-air battery device fabricated with Fe-Nx-HCS showed superior performance compared to state-of-the-art PVC catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations verified that the Fe-3 active species enhanced Fe-N-4 catalytic activity and promoted both ORR and OER. This work provides a new insight into the design and fabrication of highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000567384200006

Herein, Co-Mn carbonate hydroxide (CoMnCH) nanosheet arrays with controllable morphology and composition were developed on nickel foam (NF) as such a bifunctional electrocatalyst. It is discovered that Mn doping in CoCH can simultaneously modulate the nanosheet morphology to significantly increase the electrochemical active surface area for exposing more accessible active sites and tune the electronic structure of Co center to effectively boost its intrinsic activity. As a result, the optimized Co1Mn1CH/NF electrode exhibits unprecedented OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 294 mV at 30 mA cm(-2), compared with all reported metal carbonate hydroxides. Benefited from 3D open nanosheet array topographic structure with tight contact between nanosheets and NF, it is able to deliver a high and stable current density of 1000 mA cm(-2) at only an overpotential of 462 mV with no interference from high-flux oxygen evolution. Despite no reports about effective HER on metal carbonate hydroxides yet, the small overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER can be also achieved on Co1Mn1CH/NF by the dual modulation of Mn doping. This offers a two-electrode electrolyzer using bifunctional Co1Mn1CH/NF as both anode and cathode to perform stable overall water splitting with a cell voltage of only 1.68 V at 10 mA cm(-2). These findings may open up opportunities to explore other multimetal carbonate hydroxides as practical bifunctional electrocatalysts for scale-up water electrolysis.									579	31	0	0	23	0	588			0002-7863			WOS:000404090100044	28535047

The morphology and structure for Fe-Co Prussian blue nanocubes are controlled by fluoride etching resulting in the formation of the porous structure with a lot of defects/voids as characterized by a series of spectroscopic techniques. Iron-cobalt-fluoride nanocubes obtained at 400 degrees C possess the optimal porous structure and morphology to guarantee the channels for mass transportation and ion diffusion. The increased electrochemical surface area, more exposure of the active sites and facile construction of metal oxide layer over the catalyst surface make this novel catalyst very active for the water oxidation reaction. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate this catalyst can drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 250 mV with a Tafel slope of 38.3 mV dec(-1) and an excellent catalytic stability for 10 h in the long-term water electrolysis; the performance also outperforms most of the advanced analogous nonprecious catalysts and noble commercial IrO2 catalyst. This work provides an effective and convenient approach to design three-dimensional porous architecture catalysts for energy-relevant electro-catalysis reaction.									61	5	0	0	9	0	61			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000466257400014

While the reasonable design and controllable synthesis of bimetallic phosphide with typical nanostructure is still a great challenge. Hence, we put forward a novel and straightforward way for constructing FeP nanoparticles coated Ni2P ultrathin nanotube arrays on the surface of Ni foil (FeP-Ni2P/NF), which is synthesized through two steps of electrodeposition and subsequent in-situ phosphorization process. The obtained FeP@Ni2P/NF shows excellent electrochemical activity for OER, and it only needs potential of 1.52 V vs. RHE to reach the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline media. The excellent electro-catalytic activity of FeP@Ni2P/NF mainly benefits from: (i) the synergistic effect between FeP and Ni2P promoting electron transfer; (ii) the formation of the unique 3D ultrathin nano tube arrays increasing the quantity of active sites and avoiding the agglomeration of catalysts during testing. In addition, the influence of reaction condition on the electrochemical activity for OER has also been investigated through altering the phosphorization temperature of precursor.

X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that niobium hinders the anatase-rutile transformation and prevents the grain growth, which is important to achieve a conductive support with high specific surface area. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements have shown that the powders possess surface Ti(4+)and Nb(4+)species, and that the Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 (1050 degrees C) sample also contains Ti3+ and Nb5+ ions. Composite film electrodes containing CuCo2O4 particles (60 w/w%), Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 or Vulcan XC72R or Ebonex powder (25%), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (15%) were formed on the glassy carbon disk surface of a rotating ring-disk electrode and studied for both the O-2 evolution and O-2 reduction reactions in 1 M KOH solution and O-2-saturated 1 M KOH solution, respectively. Rutile Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 (1050 degrees C) powder was chosen owing to its larger overpotential for H-2 evolution (detrimental to the performance of bifunctional electrodes) and its low and stable anodic activity, whereas anatase Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 (450 degrees C) powder was mainly selected due to its higher specific surface area. The results have shown that the Nb0.05Ti0.95O2 powders are more suitable than Vulcan XC72R for use as a conductive support material, based oil the higher electrode intrinsic current densities recorded for O-2 evolution and reduction reactions.

Compared with H2SO4 and HNO3, HCl can promote the dissolution of Ni2+ from NiFe foam and the in situ formation of active NiFe hydroxides due to the strong interaction between Cl- and metal. In situ Raman spectroscopic characterization reveals that HCl corrosion induced NiFe hydroxides (HCl-c-NiFe) can generate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active NiOOH species at a low potential of 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and exhibits equally respectable activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). During a 1000 h test in an alkaline electrolyte or a 300 h test in an alkaline seawater electrolyte within a two-electrode system at 100 mA cm(-2), the cell exhibits outstanding stability and high Cl- tolerance with a low working voltage of 1.62 V, outperforming benchmark Pt/IrO2 and most of the reported bifunctional catalysts.									17	1	0	0	1	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000585977000022	33094769

A conductive oxide scale consisting of NiO-rich inner layer and LiFeO2-rich outer layer is formed on the alloy surface after anodic polarization at 0.25V (vs. Ag2SO4/Ag reference electrode) for 40 h. Further prolonging the polarization time leads to a three layered film with layered LiFeO2, NiO and Cu, respectively. The octahedral LiFeO2 and NiO in a size of several microns build a dense outermost layer, providing high stability and excellent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution. Behind the layer, NiO and Cu-rich layers contribute enough high electronic conductivity and good adhesion of the scale. The electrode shows a lower onset potential for O2 evolution than Pt and much better catalytic activity for O2 evolution reaction (OER) than SnO2 anode in the melt. To prove the effectiveness of the anode, cobalt powder with high purity was produced using the electrochemically pre-oxidized Ni11Fe10Cu anode in the ternary carbonate eutectic at 650degC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651			INSPEC:18726693

Rationally optimizing active sites of doped carbons can remarkably enhance their electrocatalytic performance. In this study, nitrogen and oxygen codoped carbon nanotubes were readily synthesized from the pyrolysis of polydopamine-carbon nanotube hybrids. Different electron microscopes, Raman spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to survey the morphological and componential properties. The newly-obtained catalyst features high-quality nitrogen and oxygen species, favourable porous structures and excellent electric conductivity, and thus exhibits remarkably bifunctional oxygen electrode activity.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the complex catalytic mechanisms under harsh reaction conditions remains a major challenge. We apply a self-templated strategy to introduce hierarchically nanostructured "all-surface" Fe-doped cobalt phosphide nanoboxes (Co@CoFe-P NBs) as alternative electrocatalysts for industrial-scale applications. Operando Raman spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were carried out to track the dynamics of their structural reconstruction and the real catalytically active intermediates during water splitting. Our operando analyses reveal that partial Fe substitution in cobalt phosphides promotes a structural reconstruction into P-Co-O-Fe-P configurations with low-valence metal centers (M-0/M+) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Results from density functional theory (DFT) demonstrate that these in situ reconstructed configurations significantly enhance the HER performance by lowering the energy barrier for water dissociation and by facilitating the adsorption/desorption of HER intermediates (H*). The competitive activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) arises from the transformation of the reconstructed P-Co-O-Fe-P configurations into oxygen-bridged, high-valence Co-IV-O-Fe-IV moieties as true active intermediates. In sharp contrast, the formation of such Co-III/IV-O-Fe-III/IV moieties in Co-FeOOH is hindered under the same conditions, which outlines the key advantages of phosphide-based electrocatalysts. Ex situ studies of the as-synthesized reference cobalt sulfides (Co-S), Fe doped cobalt selenides (Co@CoFe-Se), and Fe doped cobalt tellurides (Co@CoFe-Te) further corroborate the observed structural transformations. These insights are vital to systematically exploit the intrinsic catalytic mechanisms of non-oxide, low-cost, and robust overall water splitting electrocatalysts for future energy conversion and storage.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000739588500001	35308298

In the present work, we use in situ X-ray photoemission and absorption spectroscopy to resolve the long-standing debate about surface species present in iridium-based catalysts during the OER. We find that the surface of an initially metallic iridium model electrode converts into a mixed-valent, conductive iridium oxide matrix during the OER, which contains OII- and electrophilic OI- species. We observe a positive correlation between the OI- concentration and the evolved oxygen, suggesting that these electrophilic oxygen sites may be involved in catalyzing the OER. We can understand this observation by analogy with photosystem II; their electrophilicity renders the OI- species active in O-O bond formation, i.e. the likely potential-and rate-determining step of the OER. The ability of amorphous iridium oxyhydroxides to easily host such reactive, electrophilic species can explain their superior performance when compared to plain iridium metal or crystalline rutile-type IrO2.									184	2	0	0	11	0	185			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000395906900056	28507666

Ni-Fe based alloys are considerable as one of the most promising materials with superior electrocatalytic performance since the outstanding oxygen reaction activity of iron and the strong capability of nickel. Herein, Ni-Fe MOF derived Ni-Fe alloys embedded graphitic carbon electrocatalyst is synthesized as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst with hierarchical porous structure and superior oxygen reaction electrocatalytic performance. The onset potential and the half-wave potential of Ni0.6Fe0.4 CM in oxygen reaction are 0.88 V and 0.75 V, respectively, which are superior than those of commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA/ cm(2) is obtained in oxygen evolution reaction, which is well consistent with that of commercial RuO2. In the meantime, excellent long-term stability and anti-methanol ability endow Ni0.6Fe0.4 CM exhibiting brilliant electrocatalytic performance as commercial Pt/C and RuO2. The assembled Zn-air battery exhibits smaller voltage gap (0.76 V) than that for commercial Pt/C and RuO2, and it has remarkable stability around 170 cycles in the discharge-charge test. These results summarize the merits of bimetallic electrocatalysers for bifunction electrochemical performance and promote the development of electrocatalytic applications.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729959700008

Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) water electrolysis is one of the most practical ways to produce pure H-2. Electrocatalysts are key materials in the SPE water electrolysis. At the anode side, electrode materials catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) require specific properties. Among the reported materials, only iridium presents high activity and is more stable. In this Minireview, an application overview of single iridium metal and its oxide catalysts-binary, ternary, and multicomponent catalysts of iridium oxides and supported composite catalysts-for the OER in SPE water electrolysis is presented. Two main strategies to improve the activity of an electrocatalyst system, namely, increasing the number of active sites and the intrinsic activity of each active site, are reviewed with detailed examples. The challenges and perspectives in this field are also discussed.									92	6	0	0	2	0	94			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000466387800005	30656828

Here, we synthesize a V2O3-decorated spinel CoFe2O4 catalyst self-supported on nickel foam (NF) with a carbon-encapsulated mesoporous nanosheet structure [(V2O3-CoFe2O4)@C/NF] through a hydrothermal method and high-temperature annealing. It exhibits lower overpotentials for hydrogen evolution reaction (61 and 301 mV) and oxygen evolution reaction (226 and 310 mV) at +/- 10 and +/- 500 mA cm(-2) and can hold at +/- 500 mA cm(-2) for 80 h. As for overall water splitting, it needs 1.53 V to produce 10 mA cm(-2) and maintains 80 h at 100 mA cm(-2), suggesting good stability. This high performance originated from the V2O3-decorated spinel CoFe2O4, carbon-encapsulated structure and the self-supported mesoporous nanosheets. Therefore, this work provides a convenient, green, and promising method to design non-noble, low-cost, and high-efficient catalysts for water splitting.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000643606000035

However, the scarcity and high-cost limit the large-scale application of noble metal catalysts such as IrO2 and RuO2. In this work, as a low-cost catalyst for the electrochemical O-2 evolution reaction (OER), MoS2 nanoflakes were obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD) using MoCl5 and H2S on carbon fiber paper surface. According to the results of electrochemical measurements, the MoS2 nanoflakes exhibit an excellent catalytic activity, and the activity can be modulated by controlling the density and the internal resistance of MoS2 nanoflakes. Moreover, the plasma treatment can further improve the activity of MoS2 nanoflakes, and the reason was discussed through the measurements of contact angle, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemically active surface area. The MoS2 nanoflakes obtained by ALD possess huge values for electrochemical OER as a catalyst.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000455048000002	30523970

Herein, we demonstrate the investigation of multiscale integrated mushroom-shaped cobalt phosphide@nickel-cobalt phosphide (denoted CPNCP) as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions. The catalyst with a unique nano/microscale 3D "body" and "head" structure can be grown directly on a nickel substrate, promoting high conductivity, high hydrophilicity, and effective gas bubble release, bringing in a prospective candidate for practical water splitting devices. Furthermore, the practical relevance of CPNCP as a bifunctional catalyst for the overall water splitting reaction is revealed, with 10 mA.cm(-2) to achieve current density at a low overpotential of 1.49 V and maintained at 10 and 200 mA.cm(-2) for 40 h with little degradation. Also, the continuous reverse water splitting for over 6 h is capable, demonstrating CPNCP's high endurance toward constant power interruption. The turnover frequencies are calculated to be 3.208 and 1.072 s(-1) for HER and OER, respectively, describing an excellent performance of CPNCP. This work may inspire optimizing structures of transition-metal-based nanomaterials, promoting their applications in other renewable energy options.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000586710300035

The realization of viable technological solutions requires suitable efficient electrochemical catalysts with low overpotentials and long-term stability for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on cheap and nontoxic materials. Herein, we present a unique molecular approach to monodispersed, ultra-small, and superiorly active iron phosphide (FeP) electrocatalysts for bifunctional OER, HER, and overall water-splitting. They result from transformation of a molecular iron phosphide precursor, containing a [Fe2P3] core with mixed-valence (FeFeIII)-Fe-II sites bridged by an asymmetric cyclo-P-(2+1)(3-) ligand. The as-synthesized FeP nanoparticles act as long-lasting electrocatalysts for OER and HER with low overpotential and high current densities that render them one of the best-performing electrocatalysts hitherto known. The fabricated alkaline electrolyzer delivered low cell voltage with durability over weeks, representing an attractive catalyst for large-scale water-splitting technologies.									74	1	0	0	5	0	74			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000451072300010	30568784

Here we address these challenges by exploring the roles of morphology and surface chemistry, and develop inexpensive and efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. Three model electrocatalysts are flat platinum foil, molybdenum disulfide microspheres, and molybdenum disulfide microspheres modified by molybdenum carbide nanoparticles. The last catalyst is highly active for hydrogen evolution independent of pH, with low overpotentials of 227 mV in acidic medium and 220 mV in alkaline medium at a high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2), because of enhanced transfer of mass (reactants and hydrogen bubbles) and fast reaction kinetics due to surface oxygen groups formed on molybdenum carbide during hydrogen evolution. Our work may guide rational design of electrocatalysts that work well at high current densities.									268	24	0	0	20	0	268			2041-1723			WOS:000455953600001	30655511

The signs of photocurrent measured for platinum and palladium under anodic polarization were positive, suggesting that the surface oxide films formed on both metals have n-type conduction. The photocurrent measured for platinum exhibited a wavy change with an increase in polarization potential, in analogy with the potential dependence of the rate of chlorine evolution reaction. An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic study showed that the chemical composition of the surface oxide film formed on platinum changed with increasing polarization potential. Increases in Pt4+ ions, OM oxygen and zero-valent chlorine and a decrease in OH oxygen in the film with the increase in potential were observed. Therefore, the drop in chlorine evolution rate for platinum in the high potential region corresponds to the change in chemical composition of the film formed on platinum, that is, a change from PtO to PtO2. The wavy changes in the chlorine evolution rate and the photocurrent with an increase in potential was explained by a change in potential difference at the Helmholtz layer corresponding to that in the surface state from Pt2+-Cl- to Pt4+-Cl-.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:A1996UR13100008		
J	Jiang, Zhong-Jie; Jiang, Zhongqing								Interaction Induced High Catalytic Activities of CoO Nanoparticles Grown on Nitrogen-Doped Hollow Graphene Microspheres for Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						27081	10.1038/srep27081				JUN 3 2016	2016	Nitrogen doped graphene hollow microspheres (NGHSs) have been used as the supports for the growth of the CoO nanoparticles. The nitrogen doped structure favors the nucleation and growth of the CoO nanoparticles and the CoO nanoparticles are mostly anchored on the quaternary nitrogen doped sites of the NGHSs with good monodispersity since the higher electron density of the quaternary nitrogen favors the nucleation and growth of the CoO nanoparticles through its coordination and electrostatic interactions with the Co2+ ions. The resulting NGHSs supported CoO nanoparticles (CoO/NGHSs) are highly active for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with activity and stability higher than the Pt/C and for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with activity and stability comparable to the most efficient catalysts reported to date. This indicates that the CoO/NGHSs could be used as efficient bi-functional catalysts for ORR and OER. Systematic analysis shows that the superior catalytic activities of the CoO/NGHSs for ORR and OER mainly originate from the nitrogen doped structure of the NGHSs, the small size of the CoO nanoparticles, the higher specific and electroactive surface area of the CoO/NGHSs, the good electric conductivity of the CoO/NGHSs, the strong interaction between the CoO nanoparticles and the NGHSs, etc.									85	3	0	0	12	0	86			2045-2322			WOS:000376990000001	27255562

However, most of previous works focus on the enhanced catalytic properties via improving metal loading. Engineering morphologies of catalysts to facilitate mass transport through catalyst layers, thus increasing the utilization of each active site, is regarded as an appealing way for enhanced performance. Herein, we design an overhang-eave structure decorated with isolated single-atom iron sites via a silica-mediated MOF-templated approach for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. This catalyst demonstrates superior ORR performance in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes, comparable to the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and superior to most precious-metal-free catalysts reported to date. This activity originates from its edge-rich structure, having more three-phase boundaries with enhanced mass transport of reactants to accessible single-atom iron sites (increasing the utilization of active sites), which verifies the practicability of such a synthetic approach.									177	17	0	0	8	0	181			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000521400900001	32153103

However, their moderate activity for the OER is a challenge for commercial applications. In this study, a hetemstructure (W@Ni(OH)(2)/CC) composed of Ni(OH) 2 nanosheets and tungsten nanoparticles was successfully synthesized on a conductive carbon cloth to overcome the problem of deficient catalytic activity. The constructed heterointerface and the two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet morphology of the catalyst can accelerate the charge transfer, OER kinetics, and the ion/gas transport. In addition, interfacial electronic structure optimization was investigated to facilitate the formation of oxyhydroxide intermediates on the catalyst surface, which enhances the overall OER performance. This paper provides a thorough explanation on the role of modified electronic configuration in the heterostructures and proposes a new path to synthesize these heterostructures.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000691507900006

Experimental results showed that the overpotential of CO2ER into formate on Co3O4-CeO2/LGC electrode was only -0.31 V vs. RHE, and the maximum FEformate was 76.4% at -0.75 V vs RHE (-6.1 mA square cm(-2)) with desirable stability of 45 h, displaying the maximum formate rate of 1.6 mmol square m(-2) square s(-1)square C-1 square mg(-1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements showed that the addition of Co3O4 into CeO2/LGC led to highly concentrated oxygen vacancies that were found to be key in the enhanced activity and stable formate selectivity and the inhibited hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, DFT calculation demonstrated that the oxygen vacancies can effectively enhance the activation of CO2 and promote the electrochemical CO2 reduction along CO2 -> CO2* -> COOH* -> HCOOH path.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000493586600026

Herein, we report the partial nitridation of molybdenum oxide nanoparticles anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (Mo-N-CNT) architectures for a highly active OER electrocatalyst. The molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles are uniformly distributed on the surface of hierarchical N-CNT architectures, where nitrogen heteroatoms are incorporated through the thermal decomposition of carbon nitride. The modified surface chemistry can boost the electrocatalytic activity of Mo-N-CNT to show improved electrochemical behaviours for OER operation. The Mo-N-CNT achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 344 mV, Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1), and current density retention of 79% during the oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte for 80 h. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance of Mo-N-CNT is attributed to the hierarchical N-CNT structure and nitridation of Mo oxides.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2516-0230			WOS:000599127600017	36133882

Combining chronoamperometry with operando electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, we show that the deactivation via active site phase transformation from hydrous Ir oxide/hydroxide into anhydrous Ir oxide, is concomitant with the dissolution-induced loss of electrochemical surface area. The relative contributions from these deactivation paths were found to be structure sensitive. Systematic evaluation of different Ir-based catalysts at identical electro-oxidative conditions showed that hydrous IrOx with structural short-range order exhibited an initial minor degradation of intrinsic activity but the most significant dissolution after the extended stability test. In contrast, newly-reported Ir superstructures with higher crystallinity and larger proportion of low-index crystal terminations exhibited enhanced resistance to dissolution but a major degradation of intrinsic activity, as the performance-relevant hydrous oxide/hydroxide species developed only on the surface of metallic Ir. The Ir/IrOx catalyst regeneration was demonstrated. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this study, by regulating the distinctive geometric sites in spinel, Fe occupies the octahedral sites (Fe-(Oh)(3+)) and confines Co to the tetrahedral site (Co-(Td)(2+)), resulting in a strikingly high activity (eta(-2)(j = 10 mA cm) = 229 mV and eta(-2)(j = 100 mA cm) = 281 mV). Further enrichment of Fe ions would occupy the tetrahedral sites to decline the amount of Co-(Td)(2+) and deteriorate the OER activity. It is also found that similar tafel slope and peak frequency in Bode plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicate that Co-(Td)(2+) ions are primarily in charge of water oxidation catalytic center. By means of electrochemical techniques and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is proposed that Fe-(Oh)(3+) ions mainly confine cobalt ions to the tetrahedral site to restrain the multipath transfer of cobalt ions during the dynamic structural transformation between spinel and oxyhydroxide, continuously activating the catalytic behavior of Co-(Td)(2+) ions. This material-related insight provides an indication for the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.									109	1	0	0	6	0	108			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000426603200005

Hence, we perform a study on the electrocatalytic properties of LaNi1-xFexO3 (x = 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 mol%) for OER, mainly analyzing the influence provoked by the incorporation of Fe3+ in the lattice as well as the use of pyrolytic graphite sheet (PGS) as a potential substrate for electrocatalysis. These perovskites were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The thin film electrodes were prepared depositing the obtained powders on PGS substrates via drop-casting. Depending on the Fe3+ level, structural changes and morphological modifications were identified for these materials. The highest electrocatalytic activity for OER was detected for LaNi0.4Fe0.6O3. Besides the low charge transfer resistance, LaNi0.4Fe0.6O3 exhibited a lower overpotential (439 mV) and a smaller Tafel slope (52 mV dec(-1)) than the LaNiO3 (465 mV and 76 mV dec(-1)).

The slow kinetics hinders large-scale H-2 production. Herein, the spinel NiFe oxides were prepared by directly pyrolyzing nickel hexacynoferrate precursors in air. The NiFe oxides were presented as mesoporous nanocubes with a specific surface area of 125 m(2) g(-1). The mesoporous spinel NiFe oxide nanocubes can afford a geometric current of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of a 0.24 V and a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. The specific activity can reach up to 0.37 mA cm(-2) with a turnover frequency of 0.93 s(-1). The superior OER activity of the NiFe oxide nanocubes (NiFeO NCs) can outperform those of the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalysts, and compare favorably with other spinel transition metal oxides reported recently under identical condition. NiFeO NCs also show a long-term durability without significant loss of the OER activity. Our works provide a new strategy to develop efficient, robust and earth-abundant spinel NiFe oxides as advanced OER electrocatalysts to replace the expensive commercial IrO2 catalysts for water splitting in the industrial scale.

It is found that the modification can reduce the Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 particle size and make the distribution more uniform. The electrochemical performance tests show that the maximum current density of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of single Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 is 0.1830 A cm(-2) (- 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO) and the maximum current density of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is 0.2677 A cm(-2) (1 V vs. Hg/HgO), while the maximum current density of ORR of PMMA-modified Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 (Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 to PMMA mass ratio of 1:3) is 0.2687 A cm(-2) (- 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO) and the maximum current density of OER is 0.3579 A cm(-2) (1 V vs. Hg/HgO). AC impedance analysis also shows that PMMA-modified Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 has the lowest charge transfer resistance. This work certifies that PMMA-modified Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 catalyst is better than Sr2Ni0.4Co1.6O6 catalyst.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000511724100043

Ag nanoparticles are potential Pt substitutes; however, the weak oxygen adsorption energy of Ag prompted investigation of other catalysts. Herein, we prepared AgCu bimetallic nanoparticle (NP) systems to improve the catalytic performance and compared the catalytic performance of Ag, Cu, AgCu (core-shell), and AgCu (alloy) NP systems as new catalyst by investigating the adsorption energy of oxygen and the activation energy of oxygen dissociation, which is known to be the rate-determining step of ORR. By analyzing HOMO-level isosurfaces of metal NPs and oxygen, we found that the adsorption sites and the oxygen adsorption energies varied with different configurations of NPs. We then plotted the oxygen adsorption energies against the energy barrier of oxygen dissociation to determine the catalytic performance. AgCu (alloy) and Cu NPs exhibited strong adsorption energies and low activation-energy barriers. However, the overly strong oxygen adsorption energy of Cu NPs hindered the ORR.									44	0	0	0	2	0	44			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000319828000015	23650210

Unfortunately, HO center dot evolution from dissolved oxygen in traditional photocatalysis is a three-electron-reduction process via H2O2 and suffers from the low utilization efficiency of photoexcited electrons. A change of surface processes in direct HO center dot formation will induce rapid surface redox reactions and improve the utilization of conduction band electrons (CB-e(-)) for HO center dot production. In this work, we couple photocatalyst engineering using defect-engineered S-scheme WO3/g-C3N4 nanocomposites with ozonation to analyze the relative contributions of catalyst structure and surface reaction to the improved HO center dot generation and quantum efficiency. We revealed that the strategies of catalyst engineering via defect structure and S-scheme heterojunction improved CB-e(-) generation and enrichment but played a minor role in HO center dot evolution while a change of oxygen to ozone exerted a dominant effect on the surface reaction of HO center dot evolution pathway into a more efficient single-electron-transfer process. The synergy of catalyst engineering with ozone resulted in a 44-fold increase in rate constant compared with benchmark g-C3N4-based photocatalysis and catalytic ozonation. This work advances the mechanistic principles for a kinetic boost in photocatalysis in terms of catalyst design and surface reaction for micropollutant elimination and provides insights into photocatalyst modification and reaction routes in advanced oxidation processes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000773693300006

Reducibility and oxygen desorption are strongly altered by the properties of the substituting cation, even if iron remains hardly reducible up to 1000 degrees C. In addition, large differences in oxygen mobility are measured by oxygen isotopic exchange. Large higher oxygen mobility is achieved over the Cu-containing sample, while Pd substitution inhibits oxygen mobility. These observations correlate well with the evolution of catalytic activity for low-temperature CO oxidation. Indeed. Cu-containing materials present the highest catalytic activities, while Pd-substituted structure shows a low-temperature activity similar as the Fe parent material. CO oxidation is usually considered as a suprafacial reaction, where only adsorbed gas-phase species are involved. Nevertheless, the participation of oxygen surface species to the reaction (in pure ferrite structure), or from the bulk (in Cu-substituted material), is strongly suggested by oxygen mobility measurement, suggesting a redox-type oxidation mechanism.

Herein, we fabricated a monolithic-structured electrode by facilely electrodepositing NiCoFe ternary layered double hydroxides (LDHs) onto 3D conductive scaffolds, providing abundant fully exposed active sites for electrochemical reactions. The moderate Co dopant effectively improved the electrical conductivity of the LDH phase and substantially increased its intrinsic activity. When used for oxygen evolution, the as-obtained monolith LDH electrode exhibited superior kinetics with 275 mV overpotential required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.10 M KOH, as well as a very low activation energy of 21.0 kJ mol(-1). Such a freestanding electrode was also able to catalyze hydrogen evolution efficiently in alkaline media, which further enabled a high-efficiency water electrolyzer delivering 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.62 V in 1.0 M KOH. This sheds fresh insight into the principle and process of practical water electrolysis through the rational design of precious-metal-free bifunctional electrodes with a monolithic configuration.									142	17	0	0	5	0	143			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376035300020

In this study, a series of nitrogen, phosphorus co-doped porous carbon (NP-PC) catalysts are prepared and characterized. Optimized precursors' mass ratio, suitable pyrolysis temperature and appropriate heating rate are intensively studied. Notably, among as-prepared catalysts, NP-PC-950-10 executes an approximate 4e(-) oxygen reduction pathway and delivers a nearly equal ORR performance to that of commercial 20 wt.% Pt/C (C-Pt/C) catalyst. The stability and methanol crossover resistance of NP-PC-950-10 are also superior to C-Pt/C.

Under the condition of similar diesel engine, the study on the effects of adding small-molecule oxygenous fuel such as DME, methanol and ethanol into n-heptane on soot precursor-aromatics was carried out. The research results showed that with an increase of oxygen content in fuel, the concentrations of incomplete combustion intermediate products such as C2H2, C2H4 and aromatics are decreased. Although DME has the same oxygen content as ethanol, there are different fuel carbon reaction paths between these two fuels due to the different position of oxygen atom in the molecular structure. Therefore, DME has greater effectiveness on PAH evolution than ethanol. Although methanol has the same oxygen functional group as ethanol, methanol has greater effectiveness on PAH evolution than ethanol because methanol molecules do not have C-C structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-987X			INSPEC:17509661

In this work, an integrated cathode is fabricated that contains an amorphous MoS2 thin layer deposited on a 3D conductive carbon scaffold to improve the energy efficiency to approximate to 83% and cycle life up to 190 cycles. An advanced pressure-tuned stop-flow atomic layer deposition (ALD) method is employed to deposit a approximate to 5 nm thick amorphous MoS2 layer on carbon nanotube forest-covered graphite foam. It is established that this integrated 3D cathode exhibits high catalytic activity for both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The benefit of the ALD MoS2 in lowering the energy barrier is also supported by first-principles calculations. Finally, quasi-solid state flexible LOBs are also assembled that can be stably discharged up to 6 d. This new and rational design of cathode may provide a new direction for achieving high-performance flexible Li-O-2 batteries.									38	1	0	0	0	0	38			2366-9608			WOS:000540806600003

Therefore, to improve cycling performance, considerable attention has been paid to the development of an efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Catalysts that can more effectively reduce the overpotential and improve the cycling performance for the OER during charging are of particular interest. In this study, porous carbon derived from protein-based tofu was investigated as a catalyst support for the oxygen electrode (O-2-electrode) of Li-O-2 batteries, wherein ORR and OER occur. The porous carbon was synthesized using carbonization and KOH activation, and RuO2 and Pt electrocatalysts were introduced to improve the electrical conductivity and catalytic performance. The well-dispersed Pt/RuO2 electrocatalysts on the porous N-doped carbon support (Pt/RuO2@ACT) showed excellent ORR and OER catalytic activity. When incorporated into a Li-O-2 battery, the Pt/RuO2@ACT O-2-electrode exhibited a high specific discharge capacity (5724.1 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1)), a low discharge-charge voltage gap (0.64 V at 2000 mA h g(-1)), and excellent cycling stability (43 cycles with a limit capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1)). We believe that the excellent performance of the Pt/RuO2@ACT electrocatalyst is promising for accelerating the commercialization of Li-O-2 batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000634931200044	35423766

Herein, defect-rich Co3S4 particles with a diameter less than 5 nm were in-situ grown on nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon microflowers (Co3S4@FNC) through a simple hydrothermal method, in which an unconventional vulcanization process with the strongly coordinating ligand ethylenediamine and formaldehyde serving as structure-directive agents is resorted to effectively control the morphology of catalysts. The resultant Co3S4@FNC-Co3 comprises dense Co3S4 nanoparticles supported on ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets with a thickness of ca. 20 nm, as well as abundant defects on Co3S4 nanoparticles and highly porous textures on carbon microflowers. These nanostructure merits lead to efficient catalytic activities, featuring a small overpotential of only 250 mV and 140 mV for OER and HER electrocatalysis at 10 mV cm(-2). When Co3S4@FNC-Co3 is utilized as a bifunctional catalyst in an alkaline water electrolyzer, a bias of only 1.580 V is able to complement overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2). Results in present work may suggest a paradigm in the design and engineering of high-performance electrocatalysts based on nanocomposites of transition metal sulfides and carbons.

It is shown that the lead dioxide electrodes micromodified by nickel have different physicochemical properties vs. nonmodified PbO2-anodes, that are formed during the deposition.

The processes of electrochemical oxidation of 2,4-D on various materials occur qualitatively with the same mechanism and differ only in the reaction rate. It is shown that the NiPbO2-anode possesses the highest electrocatalytic activity: the destruction rate of 2,4-D on it increases 1.5 times in comparison with the unmodified lead dioxide. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) of a 0.4 mM solution of 2,4-D, determined by the dichromate method, is 90.0 mg dm(-3) which is 94 % of the theoretical value.									6	0	0	0	2	0	6			0352-5139			WOS:000460644600006

The current work explores the bifunctional electrocatalytic behavior of two sodium cobalt phosphate systems, namely, NaCoPO4 and Na2CoP2O7, prepared by solution combustion synthesis (SCS) for the first time. Formation of phase-pure orthorhombic maricite NaCoPO4 (space group: Pnma) and orthorhombic Na2CoP2O7 (space group: Pna2(1)) was confirmed by Rietveld refinement. The electrocatalytic activity of maricite NaCoPO4 and Na2CoP2O7 was investigated by using linear sweep voltammetry with a rotating disk electrode (RDE). The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities of these sodium cobalt phosphates are comparable to Vulcan carbon black and Pt/C. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Na2CoP2O7 is dominant compared to NaCoPO4 and Pt/C. The Tafel slope, electron-transfer number, and stability of the sodium-metal phosphates were calculated in different concentrations of Na+-containing aqueous electrolyte. The bifunctional activity and good stability of the sodium cobalt phosphates stem from cobalt ions and stabilization of the catalytic centers by the phosphate frameworks. The present work demonstrates sodium cobalt phosphates as alternate cost-effective, novel electrocatalysts for efficient OER/ORR activity in alkaline solution.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2196-0216			WOS:000482102400019

The preparation of heterogeneous nanostructure composite is an effective method to further improve the performance of noble-metal-free catalysts. Herein, heterogeneous nanostructure of Co3O4/Fe2O3@NF electrocatalyst for OER was fabricated by a hydrothermal method and the subsequent oxidation process. The as-prepared Co3O4/Fe2O3@NF presents a unique thin-wall cell structure. Benefiting from the thin-wall cell structure and the synergistic effect between Co3O4 and Fe2O3, as well as the three-dimensionally (3D) conductive feature of the substrate of nickel foam (NF), the Co3O4/Fe2O3@NF electrode demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER in alkaline solution. The overpotential is 254 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, the Tafel slope is only 33 mV dec(-1), and the electrode also retained good stability of 24 h at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Compared with pristine Co3O4/Fe2O3 (eta(10) = 493 mV), Co3O4@NF = 350 mV) and Fe2O3@NF (eta(10) = 378 mV), the Co3O4/Fe2O3@NF electrode displayed obviously enhanced electrocatalytic performance.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			0022-3697	1879-2553		WOS:000586405300017

Materials (Basel, Switzerland)				9	12						10.3390/ma9121012				2016 Dec 14	2016	TiO₂-coated boron particles were prepared by a wet ball milling method, with the particle size distribution and average particle size being easily controlled by varying the milling operation time. Based on the results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, it was confirmed that the initial oxide layer on the boron particles surface was removed by the wet milling process, and that a new B-O-Ti bond was formed on the boron surface. The uniform TiO₂ layer on the 150 nm boron particles was estimated to be 10 nm thick. Based on linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, current-time amperometry, and electrochemical impedance analyses, the potential for the application of TiO₂-coated boron particles as a photoelectrochemical catalyst was demonstrated. A current of 250 muA was obtained at a potential of 0.5 V for hydrogen evolution, with an onset potential near to 0.0 V. Finally, a current of 220 muA was obtained at a potential of 1.0 V for oxygen evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1944			MEDLINE:28774132	28774132

It is crucial to fabricate low-cost, earth-abundant and robust bi-functional electrocatalysts for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions. Herein, we report a polyoxometalates (POMs)-based molecular approach to construct Co promoting MoS2-based nanosheets Co5Mo10Sx employing well-defined Co-3[Co2Mo10O38H4] as superior precursor. The CoMo-POMs act as pre-assembling molecular platform for the construction and regulation of CoS2-MoS2 heteronanostructure (CoMoS active sites) through precise engineering with atomic level. The Co5Mo10Sx exhibited excellent bi-functional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline solution, with only 36 mV and 153 mV overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER and OER, respectively. We demonstrate a two-electrode cell performing water electrolysis in alkaline condition, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low cell voltage of 1.51 V. Combined with the theoretical calculations, the superior performance can be attributed to enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity of CoMoS sites, synergistic effect of heterostructure, abundant and defect-rich heterogeneous interfaces. This study provides a feasible strategy to rational design and controllable fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									31	2	0	0	4	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000551901000013

Hydrogen energy has been regarded as a kind of future energy because of its excellent characteristics of pollution-free and high calorific value. In addition, the electrolyzed water technology can also be combined with renewable energy sources such as solar energy to achieve complete recycling of hydrogen energy. In actual production, the realization of efficient water split-ting relies to a large extent on the low-cost, high-activity and durable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction catalysts. Recently, heteroatom-doped transition metal-based water electrolysis catalyst materials have shown excellent electrocatalytic performance and durability for HER and OER, showing great potential for replacing precious metal-based catalysts. This article reviews the application of heteroatom doping strategies in transition metal-based catalytic materials and their latest research progress. First, summarize the internal relationship of heteroatom doping strategy to the morphology and catalytic activ-ity of electrolyzed water catalytic materials. Then, the preparation process of heteroatom-doped transition metal-based catalytic materials for water electrolysis and the reasons for the improved performance and related mechanisms are discussed. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for the future development of heteroatom-doped transition metal-based catalytic materials are emphasized from the perspectives of catalytic mechanism and improvement measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000861235700008

Here, we report a dual cation (Fe, Zn)-doped CoP core-shell nanostructure (Fe/Zn-CoP) derived from a metal-organic framework as a robust electrocatalyst. In this strategy, the introduction of Fe not only changes the morphology to provide abundant active sites, but also modifies the electronic structure of CoP to improve intrinsic activity. Furthermore, the Zn element as a sacrificial dopant can expose more active sites to boost the catalytic reaction. Consequently, the Fe/Zn-CoP core-shell arrays exhibit low overpotentials of 75 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 267 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mV cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. When employed as both the anode and the cathode, Fe/Zn-CoP needs a low cell voltage of only 1.59 V to achieve 10 mV cm(-2). This work highlights a feasible method for combining nanostructure design and dual cation doping to prepare highly efficient electrocatalysts.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000536775400015

Here, we report a ternary hybrid that is constructed by in situ growth of cobalt selenide (Co0.85Se) nanosheets vertically oriented on electrochemically exfoliated graphene foil, with subsequent deposition of NiFe layered-double-hydroxide by a hydrothermal treatment. The resulting 3D hierarchical hybrid, possessing a high surface area of 156 m(2) g(-1) and strong coupling effect, exhibits excellent catalytic activity for OER, which only requires overpotentials of 1.50 and 1.51 V to attain current densities of 150 and 250 mA cm(-2), respectively. These overpotentials are much lower than those reported for other non-noble-metal materials and Ir/C catalysts. The hybrid also efficiently catalyzes HER in base with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of -0.26 V. Most importantly, we achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.71 V by using the 3D hybrid as both a cathode and an anode for overall water splitting, which is well comparable to the integrated performance of Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts.									638	34	0	0	19	0	646			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000369744500013

Journal of colloid and interface science				623				808	818		10.1016/j.jcis.2022.05.110				2022-Oct	2022	The exploration of high-efficiency non-noble metal catalysts for improving the intrinsic activity and active sites for overall water splitting persists as a bottleneck issue. Herein, a facile heterogeneous molten salt strategy has been proposed to fabricate CoP/Co nanosheets array that is vertically attached to a carbon matrix. Such a hierarchical structure endows the hybrid with abundant active sites and favorable reaction kinetics. Experimental results reveal that the molten salt determines the final shape of metallic Co, which is not sensitive to the organic sources. After optimization of the molten salt mass, the CoP/Co/C-6 shows the best bifunctional performance, requiring an overpotential of 132mV and 320mV at 10mAcm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Theoretical simulation results manifest the CoP/Co heterostructure alters the electronic structure of Co and CoP, and reduces the adsorption free energy of intermediates, thus further boosting the electrocatalysis activity. This work proposes a molten salt-assisted method for the rational design of novel two-dimensional nano-hybrids for energy conversion applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1095-7103		MEDLINE:35636290	35636290

Here, simulations of adsorption of H2O on nanoscale GaS reveal that localized electronic states at its edges appear in the gap and strengthen the interaction with H2O, further activating the surface atomic sites. It is thus predicted that GaS synthesized with a controlled thickness and preferred edges may be an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic splitting of water. Experiments that verify some of the predictions in this study are presented, and it is shown that GaS is effective in absorption of light and evolution of H-2 (887 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) in the presence of aqueous solution of hydrazine (1% v/v). This study should open up the use of nanoscale GaS in conversion of solar energy into environment-friendly chemical energy in the form of hydrogen.									40	1	0	0	1	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000362819300013	26146957

With nitrogen as the primary dopant, boron, sulfur, and phosphorus can be used as secondary elements for co-doped carbons. However, evaluation and analysis of the promotional effect of B, P, and S to N-doped carbons has not been widely researched. Here we report a robust platform that is constructed through polydopamine to prepare N,B-, N,P-, and N,S-co-doped carbon nanosheets, characterized by similar N species content and efficient B, P, and S doping. Systematic investigation reveals S to have the greatest promotional effect in hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) followed by P and that B decreases the activity of N-doped carbons. Experimental and theoretical analyses show the secondary heteroatom promotional effect is impacted by the intrinsic structures and extrinsic surface areas of both materials, i.e., electronic structures exclusively determine the catalytic activity of active sites, while large surface areas optimize apparent HER performance.									284	12	0	0	14	0	289			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000406649700078	28640994

Comparison of results with observations from the Alta (Utah) contact aureole indicates that both mineral reactions and isotopic alteration record fluid now through highly heterogeneous permeability. We interpret this extreme heterogeneity to be the result of positive feedback between reaction enhancement of permeability and flow-focusing. Similar distributions of mineral assemblages and stable isotopic alteration in other aureoles suggest that this is a common mechanism of permeability evolution during contact metamorphism of carbonate rocks. Flow-focusing requires fast reaction rates and slow compaction relative to fluid flow. More homogeneous permeability recorded in regional metamorphic rocks may reflect fundamental differences in the relative rates of fluid now and compaction in regional and contact metamorphic environments.									21	1	0	0	0	0	22			0091-7613			WOS:000071465600004

Herein, Prussian blue analogues (PBA) anchored on CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) pre-coated with polydopamine (PDA) are utilized as precursors to prepare ultrafine Co4S3 nanoparticles supported on N, S-codoped CNTs (Co4S3@N,S-CNT), where CdS NRs are served as sulfur sources and hard templates. After pyrolysis, the resulting Co4S3@N,S-CNT-800 shows a high specific surface area of 142.4 m(2) g(-1), together with merely 0.780 V difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ORR potential at 3 mA cm(-2). The Co4S3@N,S-CNT-800 based air cathode displays a higher discharge capacity of 787 mAh g(Zn)(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2), a higher output power density of 154 mW cm(-2), better working stability, as well as a lower charge-discharge voltage gap than the Pt/C + RuO2 based air electrode at various working current density. The remarkable oxygen reversible catalytic activities are mainly attributed to the presence of a thin layer of mesoporous carbon on partial sections of the open-end N,S-CNTs, which not only shortens the mass diffusion length but also prevents N,S-CNTs from excessively bundling to maximize the exposure of Co4S3 nanocrystallites and graphitized carbon skeletons with N or S heteroatoms.

This article reported an ORR electrocatalyst composed of nanoporous Ag (NP-Ag) and LaCoO3-delta (LC) perovskite oxide and designed to take advantage of the bi-continuous NP structure and high electrocatalytic performance of perovskite oxides. The triple-phase boundaries (TPBs) formed by NP-Ag and LC provided active sites for the electrocatalytic reactions. Further annealing promoted the interaction between NP-Ag and LC, which induced the formation of more Co3+ and surface oxygen vacancies, as proved by multiple characterizations. When the mass ratio of LC and NP-Ag was 1:2 (LC/Ag-1/ 2-A), the catalyst showed the best ORR performance with a relatively high half-wave potential, and only attenuated by 4% after 5,000 cycles of accelerated durability testing. Besides, it delivered significant bifunctionality towards both ORR and OER, bearing comparison with the reported perovskite-based electrocatalysts. This work demonstrated a novel route for extending the application of NP metals and facilely designing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

In such unique nanostructure, (1) the synergistic interaction between Co2P and Co2N in the core-shell nanostructure optimizes the electron interaction, thus reducing the energy barrier; (2) the binding effect of DNA reduces the charge transfer resistance and improve the stability of the obtained materials, the base sequence of DNA also has significantly effect on the electric catalytic performance; (3) the porous conductive carbon nanofiber matrix provides more exposures of reaction sites, thus enhancing electrolyte penetration and facilitates the release of O-2 bubbles. In view of these advantages, the Co2P/Co2N@CNF-DNA(C) nanofiber shows a remarkable OER catalytic performance and prominent electrochemical stability, outperforming those of the Co2N@CNF as well as its many counterparts. Therefore, the typical electrospinning followed by calcination strategy in which DNA used as template and P-source pave a way to synthesize other transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts in the future.

Herein, highly active and stable cobalt single-atoms with a Co-N-4 moiety were uniformly anchored on a porous porphyrinic triazine-based framework (CoSAs/PTF) by a simple ionothermal method. Due to the abundant single-atom Co-N-4 species, the hierarchical porous structure and the good conductivity, the resultant catalyst is highly active for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For the ORR, a more positive half-wave potential of 0.808 V (vs. RHE) was achieved, compared with commercial benchmark Pt/C (0.806 V). Furthermore, a small onset potential of 21 mV and a low Tafel slope of 50 mV per decade were obtained for the HER. The porphyrin-like structure was found to stabilize the CoSAs effectively, thus leading to long-term durability and a remarkable methanol-tolerant behavior. This bifunctional single-atom catalyst might be a promising candidate to replace Pt-based electrocatalysts in electrolysers and fuel cells.									105	4	0	0	1	0	105			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000457268300038

Herein, a series of LaFeO3-delta/NrGO-x (x = 10, 20, and 25) hybrid materials have been synthesized via a facile strategy that enhanced ORR performances in alkaline solutions owing to the strong coupling effect between defect-rich LaFeO3-delta perovskite nanoparticles and N-doped reduced graphene oxide (NrGO) nanosheets. Among the oxygen-deficient perovskites/carbon hybrids, LFO/NrGO (LaFeO3-delta/NrGO-20) demonstrates relatively excellent ORR catalytic activity. The Tafel slope of LFO/NrGO is lower than that of Pt/C (20 wt %). This remarkable improvement is largely correlated to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies and the distortion of [FeO6] unit. On the other hand, the excellent durability of the LFO/NrGO hybrid mainly results from the strong interaction between LaFeO3-delta nanoparticles and NrGO nanosheets. This work highlights the importance of regulating the synergy of perovskites/carbon hybrids as an effective strategy for boosting the ORR electrocatalytic activity for applications in oxygen-related energy storage and conversion processes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600010

Herein, an ingenious Co-Co3O4@NAC is prepared for this purpose by anchoring Co single atom on both Co3O4 nanoparticle and nitrogen-doped active carbon (NAC), where synergistic interaction among Co atoms, Co3O4 particles and NAC plays a significant role for excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Moreover, the primary zinc-air battery (ZAB) with the Co-Co3O4@NAC as a cathode catalyst shows a high open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.449 V, a specific energy density of 721 mA h/g and a maximum power density of 164 mW/cm(2). The rechargeable ZAB with this catalyst displays a low voltage gap of 0.773 V at 10 mA/cm(2) and stable cycling performance. This work provides a novel tactic to design elaborate high-efficient and promising bifunctional catalysts with non-noble metal atom and metal oxide for metal-air batteries.									111	3	0	0	3	0	112			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000496894300044

During large scale preparation of graphene from graphene oxide (GO), persistent presence of up to 8% residual oxygen is an issue of great concern. Such incomplete reduction is attributed to the presence of highly stable carbonyl and ether groups. Here we present a new approach for limiting the formation and behavior of these functional groups. We report high temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the oxidation process of pristine (Pr) and monovacancy (MV) graphene with O2 with specific focus on the initial reaction period. An abnormal thermal behaviour was observed in the onset times of oxidation reactions; significant differences were detected in the nucleation and growth mechanisms and reaction kinetics. Overall reaction kinetics was significantly slower in the thermal region (Pr: 4350-4450 K; MV: 4300-4450 K). By identifying this region experimentally or theoretically, a narrow window of minimal carbonyl group formation and residual oxygen could be created leading to a major breakthrough in the field.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664132200001

USE - Method for detecting quantitative of a lithium ion battery negative electrode of lithium precipitation. Uses include but are not limited to mobile communication, electronic product, energy storage and electric. ADVANTAGE - The method is simple in operation, capable of quickly and accurately detecting the negative electrode of lithium precipitation, and can distinguish the content of reversible lithium and non-reversible lithium for detecting the lithium negative electrode. The water bath can ensure the temperature of the gas and the reaction liquid in the reactor to be consistent, avoiding the different gas temperature and pressure in different positions of the reactor so that the reading of the sensor cannot truly reflect the state of the gaseous gas in the gas in reactor. When the temperature is high, the air pressure is improved along with the increase of the temperature, and when the final reading is larger, the relative error caused by the instrument error is smaller, and the precision can be improved.

J	Chopra, K.N.								Technical treatment of the efficiency maximization of the highly efficient oxygen-producing electrodes for splitting water technology								Atti della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi				71	5			579	87						Sept.-Oct. 2016	2016	The electrodeposition of hierarchically structured three-dimensional nickel-iron electrodes for efficient oxygen evolution at high current densities has been observed to be very useful for the industrial production of the clean energy fuel, hydrogen, since the new technology is based on an inexpensive, specially coated foam material that lets the bubbles of oxygen escape quickly. The present paper discusses the maximization of the efficiency of this technique, based on the mathematical modeling by the application of simple equations. The design parameters including the minimum necessary cell voltage for starting the process of electrolysis Ecell0, the change in the Gibbs free energy under standard conditions DeltaG0, the number of electrons transferred n, the activation energy Eact, the reaction enthalpy DeltaH, and the free energy (Helmholtz) DeltaA have been discussed with the objective of maximizing the efficiency of the system.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0391-2051			INSPEC:17123455

The challenges are commonly ascribed to the sluggish surface redox reactions and significant surface charge recombination. Although there are several transient techniques applied for monitoring the surface charges evolution, how the experimental spectroscopy data is interpreted still involves ambiguous explanations on the complicated reactions. Here, we firstly developed a parallel 1st-nth order reaction model, which could be applied to quantitatively analyze the surface charge reactions. The microkinetic calculations were carried out by varying the reaction order, rate constants as well as the contribution of the competitive ones. Interestingly, the simplified reaction model can successfully demonstrate the charges react rate changes, which can be further applied in mechanism study complementary with those experimental methods.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000706922700004

In this work, we have synthesized an urchin-like Co-based metal-organic framework (Co-MOF) grown on a Co(OH)(2)template by the gas phase method. As the specific surface area increased and more active sites were exposedcd, the low activity of the bulk MOF for electrocatalytic water splitting was overcome. Through a vulcanization reaction, surface vulcanized Co-MOF (CoSx/Co-MOF) was synthesized. CoSx/Co-MOF as a bifunctional catalyst has good catalytic performance toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Compared with the catalytic activity of the OER, the potential of the UOR only needs 1.315 V (vs.RHE), while the potential of the OER needs 1.51 V (vs.RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). The catalytic activity in the urea electrolysis of a CoSx/Co-MOF||CoSx/Co-MOF electrolyzer is much better than that in an alkaline electrolyte. The CoSx/Co-MOF||CoSx/Co-MOF electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.48 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for a urea electrolytic cell in 1.0 M KOH with 0.5 M urea.									40	3	0	0	3	0	40			2052-1553			WOS:000552336100001		
J	Pouladvand, Iman; Asl, Shahin Khameneh; Hoseini, Mir Ghasem; Rezvani, Mohammad								Characterization and electrochemical behavior of Ti/TiO2-RuO2-IrO2-SnO2 anodes prepared by sol-gel process								JOURNAL OF SOL-GEL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				89	2			553	561		10.1007/s10971-018-4887-4				FEB 2019	2019	The present study focused on the morphology and electrochemical properties of Ti/TiO2-RuO2-IrO2-SnO2 anodes prepared by sol-gel process, using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), potentiostatic polarization, cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and accelerated corrosion test (ACT). The findings showed that the morphology of all the coatings is a cracked-mud morphology after heat treatment, including cracks with different widths between 100 nm and 1 m. The results of phase analysis of the anode surfaces indicated a better coverage of substrate by Ti/TiO2-RuO2-IrO2-SnO2 anode with a molar ratio of 60:25:5:10 as compared to two other anodes with molar ratios of 60:25:10:5 and 60:20:5:15. It was also found that Ti/TiO2-RuO2-IrO2-SnO2 anode with a molar ratio of 60:25:5:10 exhibits a longer lifetime (543 min) and better electrocatalytic property, as it tends to enhance the chlorine gas evolution so that the reaction occurs at a lower potential with a lower slope. EDX analysis of this anode surface showed a less reduction in the content of active elements (Ru, Ir, and Sn) after ACT than anodes 1 and 3, to about 59%, 82%, and 75% of the original, respectively.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000458662700020

In this work, we report a bifunctional gas-evolving fibrous electrode based on nonprecious heterostructured Ni@NiO wrapped carbon fiber (CF) for overall water splitting reaction. The proposed Ni@NiO wrapped CF (CF@Ni@NiO) was fabricated through a simple and controllable electrodeposition and subsequent low-temperature calcination procedure, which can easily be scaled up for practical use. Benefitting from the exposed heterojunction-like Ni@NiO nanointerfaces and the formation of Ni (III) species, the resultant CF@Ni@ NiO electrode exhibits excellent catalytic activity, favorable kinetics, as well as strong durability toward both cathodic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in alkaline electrolyte, with an overall water-splitting current of 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.73 V (iR uncorrected), which outperforms that of other reported nonprecious electrocatalysts. Moreover, owing to their intrinsic mechanical flexibility, these fibrous gas-evolving electrodes can be readily woven into textile structures for practical applications. The simple, low-cost, and scalable fabrication process of heterostructured materials modified fibrous electrode, coupled with recent progress in nonprecious electrocatalysts for both HER and OER, offers the possibilities to systematically study the dependence of catalytic performance on the structural parameters of the electrocatalysts, which also open new horizon for the development of next-generation flexible water-splitting devices.									50	8	0	0	0	0	50			2168-0485			WOS:000391246000058		
J	Davankov, V. A.								The Riddle of Atmospheric Oxygen: Photosynthesis or Photolysis?								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				95	10			1963	1970		10.1134/S0036024421100046				OCT 2021	2021	The stoichiometry of the photosynthetic reaction requires that the quantities of the end products (organic biomaterial and free oxygen) be equal. However, the correct balance of the amounts of oxygen and organic matter that could have been produced by green plants on the land and in the ocean since the emergence of unique oxygenic photosynthetic systems (no more than 2.7 billion years ago) is virtually impossible, since the vast majority of oxygen was lost in oxidizing the initially reducing matter of the planet, and the bulk of organic carbon is scattered in sedimentary rocks. In recent decades, convincing information has been obtained in favor of the large-scale photolysis of water molecules in the upper atmosphere with the scattering of light hydrogen into space and the retention of heavier oxygen by gravity. This process has been operating continuously since the formation of the Earth. It is accompanied by huge losses of water and the oxidation of salts of ferrous iron and sulfide sulfur in the oceans and methane in the atmosphere. The main stages of the evolution of the atmosphere and surface layers of the Earth's crust are analyzed for the first time in this work by considering the parallel processes of photosynthesis and photolysis. Large-scale photolysis of water also provides consistent explanations for the main stages in the evolution of the nearest planets of our Solar System.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0036-0244	1531-863X		WOS:000702683500001

The compositions and the sizes of the hollow cavities of cobalt nickel oxides can be easily controlled by the Co/Ni molar ratios and the size of bimetallic alkoxide microspheres, respectively. The electrochemical measurements indicate that the cobalt nickel oxide catalysts exhibit greatly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline media, and Co-2-Ni-1-O microspheres with the optimal composition show the lowest overpotential (approximate to 310 mV for 10 mA cm(-2)) and the smallest Tafel slope (57 mV per decade). This is attributed to the large electrochemically reactive surface and good charge conduction offered by the synergetic effects between their unique structural features and tunable compositions. The hollow cobalt nickel oxide microspheres may serve as promising noble-metal-free OER electrocatalysts to replace IrOx material, and the synthetic strategy that directs structural design can be applied to prepare other multifunctional materials.									19	1	0	0	1	0	20			2052-1553			WOS:000442606200016

Fabricated by one-step electrodeposition with binary alloy on a hydrogen bubble template, the porous foam exhibited remarkable HER activity in alkaline conditions. Cu was the dominant element in the core and shell region and acted for 3D structure formation. Cu-Co formed in the shell part and acted as an active region for hydrogen evolution reaction. Also, as the amount of P increased in the Cu-Co-P foams, the pore numbers, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and the HER activity were enhanced. The improved activity is believed to originate from the charge separation between the negatively charged P (delta(-)) and positively charged Cu and Co (delta(+)), the larger ECSA, and increased porosity.									55	4	0	0	2	0	55			2168-0485			WOS:000472240900062

XRD measurements showed mixed oxides present a low degree of crystallinity. E-oc-data and CV-spectra support surface electrochemistry of mixed oxides is governed by the Ru(III)/Ru(IV) redox couple. In situ surface characterisation revealed the active surface area increases on increasing nominal CeO2-content. phi-Values remained in the 0.18-0.3 interval supporting the coatings have a low electrochemical porosity. Kinetics was studied recording polarisation and chronopotentiometric curves, which permitted to determine the Tafel slope and reaction order (with respect to OH-), in the low and high overpotential domains. Tafel slope data, b, presented a dependence on overpotential and oxide composition indicating the OER electrode mechanism depends on these variables. A unit reaction order with respect to OH- was found for all electrode compositions investigated. The theoretical analysis of the electrode mechanism permitted to analyse the changes in the experimental Tafel slopes taking into account modifications in the apparent electronic transfer coefficient, alpha(ap).

The hierarchical Ru nanospheres were synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method. As evaluated by electrochemical measurements, it was found that the carbon-free hierarchical Ru nanosphere cathode can significantly reduce discharge and charge overpotential (similar to 0.3 V with the capacity limited to 1000 mA h g(-1)) with a high discharge capacity of 3445 mA h g(-1) at a current density of 200 mA g(-1) (ORR). This superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction catalytic performance can be maintained over long time cycling at different current densities. Ex situ scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman measurements reveal that leaf-shaped Li2O2 is the only reaction product during the discharge process, and the hierarchical Ru nanospheres can effectively decompose the Li2O2 discharge product, facilitate the OER, and promote a high round-trip efficiency. Therefore, the carbon-free hierarchical Ru nanospheres are a promising cathode catalyst for rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries with low charge overpotential, long cycle life, and high specific capacity.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360490600008

Carbon-based cathodes provide active sites for mass and electronic transfer among Li, Li+, O-2, Li2O2, LiO2. The synthesis methods of carbon cathode can affect the performance of Lithium-based battery. This review summarizes the fundamentals of carbon-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduced reaction (ORR) electrocatalytic reactions, and then explore a few key concerns on the interrelation between synthesis methods and electrocatalytic ac-tivities. Then, the most important tactics: defect engineering, heteroatom doping, and structure optimization for enhancement of electrocatalytic activity are presented. Finally, the most recent advances of carbon-based ma-terials from dimensional views are also discussed. The review would provide insightful opportunities as well as the current challenges to accelerate the research and application on carbon-based materials for Lithium-based batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2214-9937			WOS:000818726000001

The structural characterizations confirm that the synthesized nanoparticles with an average size around 9 nm are densely and uniformly assembled on the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the as-synthesized Cu0.31Ni0.69O/rGO catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for oxygen reduction reaction with high cathodic current density (2.08 x 10(-4) mA/cm(2)), positive onset potential (-0.21 V), low H2O2 yielding rate (less than 2.5%) and long-term running stability. The rotating disk and rotating ring-disk electrode measurements proved that the oxygen reduction reaction occurs on Cu0.31Ni0.69O/rGO through a high efficient four-electron pathway.

It was found to be catalytically active for the water oxidation reaction under basic conditions. Based on the electrochemical test result, this copper complex displayed an apparent rate constant (k(cat)) of 0.81 s(-1) for the oxygen evolution reaction in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution at pH 11.0. More importantly, the copper complex remained stable over 3 h of a bulk electrolysis experiment at 1.60 V with a Faradaic efficiency of 90.7% for O-2 evolution, and the decrement of current density was only 1.9%. These results suggest that the pentadentate copper complex is an efficient and durable homogeneous Earth-abundant electrocatalyst for water oxidation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000678746800001	34308951

The prepared samples are analyzed using SEM, XRD, XPS and electrochemical analysis techniques. Results indicated that the Ni/Mo/Cu coating has a rough and globular structure and presents high current density, a lower Tafel slope of 23.9 mV/dec than 30 mV/dec of Pt, which exceeds the electrochemical activity of Pt electrode. Its remarkably enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the high surface area, high conductivity as well as synergistic interaction among Ni, Mo and Cu.

In this study, carbon-incorporated porous honeycomb NiCoFe phosphide (labelled NiCoFeP/C) was successfully developed from a metal-organic framework (MOF) precursor for the first time. Benefitting from a unique structure and compositional advantages, NiCoFeP/C exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) in alkaline solution, showing low OER and HER overpotentials of 270 and 149 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively.

They are required for many important signaling reactions, but are also toxic byproducts of aerobic metabolism. Recent studies revealed that ROS are necessary for the progression of several basic biological processes including cellular proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, cell death-that was previously thought to be the outcome of ROS directly killing cells by oxidation, in other words via oxidative stress-is now considered to be the result of ROS triggering a physiological or programmed pathway for cell death. This Opinion focuses on the possibility that ROS are beneficial to plants, supporting cellular proliferation, physiological function, and viability, and that maintaining a basal level of ROS in cells is essential for life.									1258	52	2	0	975	16	1308			1360-1385			WOS:000392892400006	27666517

Pt-Ir catalysts supported on rGO (Pt-Ir/rG0s) were physically characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to observe change in composition by heat treatment, alloying, and morphological transition of the catalysts. Their catalytic activities and stabilities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions were electrochemically investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), potential cycling and hold tests on the rotating disk electrode (RDE). Pt-Ir/rGO with no post heat treatment (Pt-Ir/rGO_NP) showed a lower activity for ORR and OER although metal nanoparticles decorated on the support are relatively small. However, Pt-Ir/rGO showed remarkably enhanced activity following heat treatment, depending on temperature. Pt-Ir/rGO heat-treated at 600 degrees C after spray pyrolysis (Pt-Ir/rGO_P600) exhibited a higher activity and stability than a commercially available Pt/C catalyst kept under the ORR condition, and it also revealed a comparable OER activity and durability versus the commercial unsupported Ir catalyst.

Great progress has been made in promoting the performance and understanding the underlying fundamentals.

Herein, taking the cubic CoSe2 as an example, a universal strategy to synergistically achieve active sites and dynamic regulation is developed by incorporating low-valence Zn. It is revealed that regulation by Zn can facilitate reconstruction of the surface to form active Co oxyhydroxides under OER conditions. By combining theoretical calculations and characterization by various techniques, it is shown that the incorporation of Zn into CoSe2 can cause subtle lattice distortion and strong electronic interactions, thereby contributing to increased active site exposure and improved OER kinetics. Density functional theory simulations demonstrate that Zn incorporation synergistically optimizes the kinetic energy barrier by promoting co-adsorption of OER intermediates on a Co site and its adjacent Zn site. As a result, the modified CoSe2 NAs electrode shows optimized catalytic activity and excellent stability with the low overpotential of only 286 mV required to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte.									33	5	0	0	1	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000515179400001	32091162

However, the formation of stable Li2O discharge product increases the overpotential during the charging process, which compromises the cell performance because of the resulting parasitic reaction. In this study, we demonstrate a potent approach to reversibly operate an oxygen-gas-reservoir-free Li-O-2 battery by using chemically impregnated nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles as a catalyst on the carbon electrode. The efficient bottom-up process for decorating NiO on a carbon material in binary molten electrolyte enables not only to significantly reduce the loading level of the catalyst but also to enhance the electrochemical performance with preventing the detrimental parasitic reaction in the oxygen-gas-reservoir-free Li-O-2 cell. In particular, using the in situ gas analysis with electrochemical measurements, the 20 wt% NiO added to the carbon cathode is sufficient to reduce the charging potential without generation of parasitic gas evolution.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449447800009

S atoms can not only effectively stabilize oxygen vacancies (Vo), but also form the Co-S coordination with Co active site in the Vo, which can modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling FeCoOx-Vo-S to exhibit much superior OER activity. FeCoOx-Vo-S exhibits a mass activity of 2440.0 A g(-1)at 1.5 V vs. RHE in 1.0 mKOH, 25.4 times higher than that of RuO2. The Tafel slope is as low as 21.0 mV dec(-1), indicative of its excellent charge transfer rate. When FeCoOx-Vo-S (anode catalyst) is paired with the defective CoP3/Ni2P (cathode catalyst) for overall water splitting, current densities of as high as 249.0 mA cm(-2)and 406.0 mA cm(-2)at a cell voltage of 2.0 V and 2.3 V, respectively, can be achieved.									93	7	0	0	1	0	93			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000545688400001	32495475

The obtained bifunctional electrocatalyst shows good catalytic performance with comparable limiting diffusion current to PVC and comparable potential to RuO2, in particular, superior stability to both PVC and RuO2 towards ORR and OER. In view of the efficient bifunctional catalyst activity for ORR and OER, the obtained catalyst in ZAB displays high charge/discharge performance and long cycling stability, demonstrating great potential in grid-scale energy storage.									27	2	0	0	1	0	27			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000498040800001

Despite the substantial efforts, the driving force required for water oxidation is largely making the reaction inefficient. In the present work, we collected published studies involving DFT calculations for the OER, with the purpose to understand why the progress made so far, for lowering the overpotential of the reaction, is relatively small. The data revealed that the universal scaling relationship between HO* and HOO* intermediates is still present and robust, despite the variety in methods and structures used for calculating the binding energies of the intermediates. On the other hand, the data did not show a clear trend line regarding the O* binding. Our analysis suggested that trends in doped semiconducting oxides behave very differently from those in other oxides. This points towards a computational challenge in describing doped oxides in a realistic manner. We propose a way to overcome these computational challenges, which can be applied to simulations corresponding to doped semiconductors in general.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000521247400005	34122795

Herein, we report an anion exchange membrane electrolyzer using Fe-doped Ni hydroxide as an anode catalyst that is on par with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers in terms of the performance, 2 A cm(-2) at 2.046 V and 50 degrees C. We found that Fe doping stabilizes the alpha-Ni(OH)(2) phase, which is key to ensure the fast Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH redox transition and the subsequent fast reaction between Ni3+/4+ and the electrolyte (OH-), resulting in the excellent oxygen evolution reaction activity of Fe-doped Ni hydroxide. Spin-polarized DFT + U computations reveal that the local arrangement of Fe3+ with Ni3+/4+ plays a crucial role in enabling the high OER activity on the (001) facet of this anode catalyst.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2574-0962			WOS:000745945700001

Our theoretical investigation to probe the HER and OER on both the H and T phases of 2D TiS2 is based on electronic-structure calculations witihin the framework of density functional theory (DFT). Since TiS2 is the lightest compound among the group-IV TMDCs, it is worth exploring the catalytic activity of a TiS2 monolayer through the functionalization at the anion (S) site, substituting with P, N, and C dopants as well as by incorporating single sulfur vacancy defects. We have investigated the effect of functionalization and vacancy defects on the structural, electronic, and optical response of a TiS2 monolayer by determining the density of states, work-function, and optical absorption spectra. We have determined the HER and OER activities for the functionalized and defective TiS2 monolayers based on the reaction coordinate, which can be constructed from the adsorption free energies of the intermediates (H*, O*, OH* and OOH*, where * denotes the adosrbed state) in the HER and OER mechanisms. Finally, we have shown that TiS2 monolayers are emerging as a promising material for the HER and OER mechanisms under the influence of functionalization and defects.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000458952600015	30552837

So far, it is still challenging to develop a cost-efficient and highly active catalyst for OER processes. To address such issues, we design and synthesize NiP2/FeP heterostructural nanoflowers interwoven by carbon nanotubes (NiP2/FeP@CNT) by a hydrothermal reaction followed by phosphating. The NiP2/FeP@CNT catalyst delivers excellent OER performance: it displays an ultralow Tafel slope of 44.0 mV dec(-1) and a relatively low overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), better than RuO2 commercial catalyst; it also shows excellent stability without observable decay after 20-h cycling. The outstanding OER property is mainly attributed to its special 3D stereochemical structure of CNT-interwoven NiP2/FeP heterostructural nanoflowers, which is highly conductive and guarantees considerable active sites. Such nanostructure greatly facilitates the charge transfer, which significantly improves its electrocatalytic activity.

But the intrinsic oxidation reaction between 02 and coal is the main source responsible for the self heating and spontaneous combustion of brown coal. In this research, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was introduced to determine the intrinsic reaction of Ximeng brown coal oxidation at low temperature. The heat evolution of the intrinsic reaction after eliminating the evaporation of water and thermal decomposition of inner oxygen-containing functional groups was obtained by subtracting the DSC curve in N-2 from the DSC curve in air. It is considered that the intrinsic reactions between coal and oxygen could be divided into three stages, including the slow oxidation, accelerated oxidation and rapid oxidation stages. Compared with DSC-air curve, the DSC-sub curve based on the subtracting results elucidated the exothermic characteristics of intrinsic oxidation reaction in each stage more clearly. In addition, DSC-sub curve reduced the experimental errors inborn from the heating rate and the sample mass, so it had more practical application value than DSC-air curves. Activation energies obtained from DSC-sub curves can better reflect intrinsic oxidation reaction and be used as important indicators for the evaluation of coal spontaneous combustion tendency.

Copper is theoretically proposed to exhibit high reduction capability close to Pt, but its high diffusion behavior at elevated fabrication temperatures limits its homogeneous incorporation with carbon. Here, a Cu, Co-embedded nitrogen-enriched mesoporous carbon framework (CuCo@NC) is developed using, a facile Cu-confined thermal conversion strategy of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67) pre-grown on Cu(OH)(2) nanowires. Cu ions formed below 450 degrees C are homogeneously confined within the pores of ZIF-67 to avoid self-aggregation, while the existence of Cu. N bonds further increases the nitrogen content in carbon frameworks derived from ZIF-67 at higher pyrolysis temperatures. This CuCo@NC electrocatalyst provides abundant active sites, high nitrogen doping, strong synergetic coupling, and improved mass transfer, thus significantly boosting electrocatalytic performances in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A high half-wave potential (0.884 V vs reversible hydrogen potential, RHE) and a large diffusion-limited current density are achieved for ORR, comparable to or exceeding the best reported earth-abundant ORR electrocatalysts. In addition, a low overpotential (145 mV vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) is demonstrated for HER, further suggesting its great potential as an efficient electrocatalyst for sustainable energy applications.									396	23	0	0	18	0	399			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000409410000019

However, many transition metal oxides possess lower catalytic activity as catalysts in dual-functional oxygen reduction (ORR) and evolution reactions (OER). Within this work, we have devised and fabricated an N doped carbon dots (CDs) modified needle-like NiCo2O4 supported on graphene (NiCo2O4-G-NCDs) composite as promising dual-functional catalyst in both ORR and OER. Needle-like NiCo2O4-G-NCDs composites were fabricated by one-pot solvothermal method and displayed significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performances in both ORR and OER (0.82 V vs. RHE of half-wave potentials for ORR, smaller Tafel slopes (63.94 mV dec(-1)) and lower OER overpotential (308 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2)) than that of NiCo2O4-G and NiCo2O4-G-CDs). The resulting NiCo2O4-G-NCDs composite shows comparable dualfunctionality to the PVC and RuO2 for ORR and OER in alkaline condition. The enhanced electrocatalytic performances of NiCo2O4-G-NCDs composite should ascribe to the synergy between N-doped CDs and NiCo2O4. Our study affords a feasible strategy for the development of multifunctional electrocatalyst in metal-air batteries.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000505643500027

The mechanisms of CO formation reactions remain problematic, particularly the identity of the functional group precursors for low-temperature CO. In this paper, pyrolysis experiments of superfine pulverized coal were carried out in the N-2 and CO2 atmosphere under non-isothermal conditions, applying a fixed-bed reactor. The CO formation mechanisms were investigated from a functional-group standpoint. The deconvolution method via numerical analysis was adopted to resolve the multi-component envelop profiles of CO evolution. Five constituent reaction complexes induced by different oxygenated groups and reactions are recognized, combining the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. In addition, the effects of coal type, particle size, pyrolysis atmosphere and heating rate on the CO evolution were analyzed. Finally, different CO formation mechanisms initiated from the primary decomposition of distinctive oxygenated functionalities, secondary pyrolysis reactions of tars, and gasification reactions of chars are summarized.

UTE has far-reaching impact on revolutionary low-carbon metal extraction and the in situ production of oxygen for deep-space exploration. It is hence of urgency to systematically summarize the development of UTE. In this Review, the basic concepts of UTE and the physicochemical properties of molten oxides are analyzed. The principles in the design of inert anodes for the oxygen evolution reaction in molten oxides are discussed, which forms a solid basis for the in situ production of oxygen from simulated lunar regolith by UTE.

Here, authors employ chiral fused thiadiazole-helicenes to control spin polarization in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts.A sustainable future requires highly efficient energy conversion and storage processes, where electrocatalysis plays a crucial role. The activity of an electrocatalyst is governed by the binding energy towards the reaction intermediates, while the scaling relationships prevent the improvement of a catalytic system over its volcano-plot limits. To overcome these limitations, unconventional methods that are not fully determined by the surface binding energy can be helpful. Here, we use organic chiral molecules, i.e., hetero-helicenes such as thiadiazole-[7]helicene and bis(thiadiazole)-[8]helicene, to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by up to ca. 130 % (at the potential of 1.65 V vs. RHE) at state-of-the-art 2D Ni- and NiFe-based catalysts via a spin-polarization mechanism. Our results show that chiral molecule-functionalization is able to increase the OER activity of catalysts beyond the volcano limits. A guideline for optimizing the catalytic activity via chiral molecular functionalization of hybrid 2D electrodes is given.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2041-1723		WOS:000810123400012	35688831

Developing porous polymers with micro and mesoscale porosity with long-range order is challenging and involves multistep templated approaches. Here we demonstrate a simple surface-oxygen induced electropolymerization route to directly obtain self-assembled porous polymers of polyparaphenylene (PPP) and PPP based copolymers in ionic liquids. By combining experimental and theoretical studies, we show that surface oxygen on Cu changes the orientation and assembly of benzene which then results in a change in electropolymerization mechanism leading to a self-assembled porous structure with porosity between 2 and 5 mu m. Furthermore, with controlled experimental parameters, bicontinuous conducting polymers with porosity of >10 mu m are obtained. The porous conducting polymers show absorption of light in the visible range which was also used as an efficient electrode for investigation of the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000546772100001

The strategy of element modification is effective for tuning the electronic structures of electrocatalysts. Herein, binder-free, phosphorus-doped NiCo2S4/CFP (Ni-Co-S-P) was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions, followed by surface phosphorization via solid reaction. The incorporation of P modulates the electronic structure of the Ni-Co-S-P catalyst, increases the electrical conductivity, and promotes the electrochemical surface area and the number of active sites, thereby improving its activity. The Ni-Co-S-P catalyst delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 176 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and an overpotential of 265 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). When assembled into an electrolyzer both as a cathode and anode, it demonstrated outstanding activity for overall water splitting to afford a potential of 1.76 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with no obvious decay after 25 h.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000714702800001	34739538

Herein, we report a facile method for compounding two-dimensional sandwich-like Co/C samples with a series of different thicknesses of Pt layers, based on a seed-mediated growth method in chloroplatinic acid solution. There is only a 12.7% specific activity loss after 40000 potential cycles. The sample exhibits super-high durability activity compared with other CoPt alloy catalysts under the same test conditions, benefiting from a great carbon layer maskant and Pt shell protection. According to density functional theory calculations, the nonprecious metal core has an indispensable role in adjusting the surface Pt atom and enhancing the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction. Our studies represent a robust method to design a core-shell structure with an ultralow content of Pt and improve the oxygen reduction reaction activity by tuning the nanoparticle architecture.									19	1	0	0	1	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900016

The electrocatalytic performance evaluations show that the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of 342 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is superior to the most advanced ruthenium oxide electrocatalyst. The electrocatalyst also shows better stability than the benchmark RuO2. After 9 h, the current density is only decreased by 10%, which is far less than the loss of RuO2. Moreover, its onset potential for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 0.93 V and follows the ideal 4-electron approach. After the stability test, the current density of the electrocatalyst retains 94% of the initial value, which is better than Pt/C. The above results indicate that the electrocatalyst has bifunctional activity and excellent stability both for OER and ORR.

Simulations are performed using the ReaxFF classical reactive force field. We present here additional evidence that this method accurately reproduces ab initio derived energies relevant to HOPG oxidation. HOPG is modeled as multilayer graphene and etch-pit formation and evolution is directly simulated through a large number of sequential atomic oxygen collisions. The simulations predict that an oxygen coverage is first established that acts as a precursor to carbon removal reactions, which ultimately etch wide but shallow pits, as observed in experiments. In quantitative agreement with experiment, the simulations predict the most abundant product species to be O-2 (via recombination reactions), followed by CO2, with CO as the least abundant product species. Although recombination occurs all over the graphene sheet, the carbon removal reactions occur only about the edges of the etch pit. Through isolated defect analysis on small graphene models as well as trajectory analysis performed directly on the predicted etch pit, the activation energies for the dominant reaction mechanisms leading to O-2, CO2, and CO product species are determined to be 0.3, 0.52, and 0.67 eV, respectively. Overall, the qualitative and quantitative agreement between MD simulation and experiment is very promising. Thus, the MD simulation approach and C/H/O ReaxFF parametrization may be useful for simulating high-temperature gas interactions with graphitic materials where the microstructure is more complex than HOPG.									30	0	0	0	1	0	30			1089-5639			WOS:000317317300005	23438070

Aqueous electrolytes facilitate more sustainable battery technologies due to the attributes of being nonflammable, environmentally benign, and cost effective. Yet, water's narrow electrochemical stability window remains the primary bottleneck for the development of high-energy aqueous batteries with long cycle life and infallible safety. Water's electrolysis leads to either hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which causes a series of dire consequences, including poor Coulombic efficiency, short device longevity, and safety issues. These are often showstoppers of a new aqueous battery technology besides the low energy density. Prolific progress has been made in the understanding of HER and OER from both catalysis and battery fields. Unfortunately, a systematic review on these advances from a battery chemistry standpoint is lacking. This review provides in-depth discussions on the mechanisms of water electrolysis on electrodes, where we summarize the critical influencing factors applicable for a broad spectrum of aqueous battery systems.

In situ grown Ni nanoparticles on perovskites have been recently reported to enhance catalytic activities in high-temperature systems such as solid oxide cells (SOCs). However, the micrometer-scale primary particles prepared by conventional solid-state reactions have limited surface area and tend to retain much of the active catalytic element within the bulk, limiting efficacy of such exsolution processes in low-temperature systems. Here, a new, highly efficient, solvothermal route is demonstrated to exsolution from smaller scale primary particles. Furthermore, unlike previous reports of B-site exsolution, it seems that the metal nanoparticles are exsolved from the A-site of these perovskites. The catalysts show large active site areas and strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), leading to approximate to 26% higher geometric activity (25 times higher mass activity with 1.4 V of Eon-set) and stability for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) with only 0.72 mu g base metal contents compared to typical 20 wt% Ni/C and even commercial 20 wt% Ir/C. The findings obtained here demonstrate the potential design and development of heterogeneous catalysts in various low-temperature electrochemical systems including alkaline fuel cells and metal-air batteries.									32	1	0	0	0	0	32			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000510057300001		
J	Sun, Zemin; Lin, Liu; Yuan, Mengwei; Li, Huifeng; Sun, Genban; Nan, Caiyun; Ma, Shulan; Yang, Xiaojing								Two-dimensional beta-cobalt hydroxide phase transition exfoliated to atom layers as efficient catalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				281				420	428		10.1016/j.electacta.2018.05.201				AUG 10 2018	2018	Metal-oxygen batteries, especially Li-oxygen batteries (LOBs), have attracted tremendous research attentions in the past decades. It is necessary to design novel cost-effective catalysts in the development of high performance rechargeable LOBs. Herein, we prepare the atom-layered two-dimensional (2D) beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (AL-beta-Co(OH)(2)) via phase transition of layered alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets (alpha-Co(OH)(2)) in a mild wet chemical process. The thickness of AL-beta-Co(OH)(2) is less than 1.5 nm. It is the first time of using atom-layered b-Co(OH)(2) in the system of LOBs and this material shows outstanding catalytic performance. The AL-beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets as electrocatalysts in LOBs can better reduce the over-potential, enhance the specific capacity and improve cycling capability. It demonstrates a high initial capacity 11841 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 100 mA g(-1). It displays long cycle stability more than 70 cycles with a capacity restriction of 1000 mAh g(-1). These results suggest that this strategy for designing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts via exfoliation of materials to atom-layered level could be a promising way to improve the performance of LOBs.

J	Hou, Jincheng; Wang, Yuan; Wan, Xiangming; Chen, Wengang; Wang, Xiao; Yuan, Zhentao; We, Yan; Hu, Changyi								Stress Regulation of the Oxygen Reduction Reaction on a Pt (100) Surface Using First Principles Calculations								CHEMISTRY LETTERS				51	5			566	569		10.1246/cl.210786				MAY 2022	2022	The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a strained Pt (100) surface has been studied using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results showed a linear relationship between strain and the d-band center. The adsorption energy displayed greater sensitivity to compressive strain and the adsorption energy results indicated that the bridge site was more stable after the adsorption of *OH, *O and *OOH. Concomitantly, the calculated free energy diagram results confirmed that compression deformation could reduce the over potential of the ORR reaction and increase the catalyst activity on the Pt (100) surface. The evolution of H2O exhibited the largest free energy difference, suggesting that it was a potentially rate limiting step. Notably, the limiting potentials for the individual steps were fitted by the *OOH vs. *OH or *O scaling relationship and the maximum overpotential value for the ORR reaction was 0.820 V when the compressive strain reached -10%. This study provided mechanistic and quantitative guidance for the rational selection of stress regulation strategies to fabricate Pt catalysts with desirable electrocatalytic activity in emerging energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000813951000014

In this article, we report the synthesis of a series of Ni-based NiMOOH layered double hydroxide (LDH, M = Cr, Fe, Co) nanosheets with sizes of about 20 nm with tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH) as a base source under mild reaction conditions. NiFeOOH shows much lower onset potential than NiCoOOH, NiCrOOH and Ni(OH)(2) in alkaline solution. To further improve the OER activity, NiMOOH/CNT hybrid composites was prepared by in situ addition of carbon nanotubes (CNT) during the synthesis process of NiMOOH. The hybrid composites afford much higher activity than NiMOOH alone, especially for NiFeOOH/CNT with the overpotential of 278 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. The significantly improved OER activity of NiMOOH/CNT hybrid composites is mainly attributed to the synergetic effect of CNT and nanostructured NiMOOH by improving the electric conductivity and increasing the exposure degree of active sites for OER. Moreover, the hybrid composites also possess high stability for a prolonged testing time.									17	2	0	0	0	0	18			2046-2069			WOS:000381513600068

Here, we investigate the efficient conversion of biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), an important building block in the polymer and pharmaceutical industries, using a cheap and abundant nickel-based electrocatalyst. We elucidate the key factors for tuning the chemical selectivity for HMF oxidation over the competing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the catalyst surface. We show that the selectivity for HMF oxidation is enhanced by removing trace impurities of iron species as well as adjusting the composition of the alkali hydroxide electrolyte solution. LiOH solution without iron impurities is more favorable for HMF oxidation, whereas CsOH solution with iron species present is more active for the OER and unfavorable for HMF oxidation. Under optimized conditions, HMF oxidation in 1 M LiOH electrolyte solution without iron (pH 14) achieved 98% faradaic efficiency for the production of FDCA. The principles used in this work can be applied to other electrosynthetic reactions, in particular where the OER is the main competing side reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000703630600001

Herein, a facile solution impregnation method is developed for growing ultrathin (2 nm) highly crystalline beta-FeOOH nanolayers with abundant oxygen vacancies on BiVO4 photoanodes. These exhibited a remarkable photocurrent density of 4.3 mA cm(-2) at 1.23V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), AM 1.5G), which is approximately two times higher than that of amorphous FeOOH fabricated by electrodeposition. Systematic studies reveal that the excellent PEC activity should be attributed to their ultrathin crystalline structure and abundant oxygen vacancies, which could effectively facilitate the hole transport/trapping and provide more active sites for water oxidation.									398	18	0	0	46	0	401			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000424879400041	29333765

In this work, a layered Na0.67Cu0.28Mn0.72O2 cathode is reported that has reversible lattice oxygen redox activity with small voltage hysteresis. This compound provides a highly reversible capacity of 104 mAh g(-1) with a smooth voltage profile originating from both cationic and anionic redox reactions. Density functional theory calculations show that the nonbonding O 2p states along the Cu-O bonds promote the oxygen redox activity. In-situ X-ray powder diffraction patterns and Raman spectra show that the small voltage hysteresis during electrochemical cycling is rooted in the absence of phase transitions and the stable oxygen stacking sequence. These findings may provide new insight into the anionic redox activity and offer a new strategy to design cathodes with high energy density and structural stability.									55	7	0	0	2	0	58			2405-8297			WOS:000529908800027

While numerous works were devoted to understand the effect of the electrolyte composition on the physical properties of the catalysts' surface, very little is known yet about its exact impact on the OER kinetics parameters. In this work, we reveal that the origin for the electrolyte-dependent OER activity for Co-based catalysts originates from two different effects. Increasing the alkaline electrolyte concentration for La1-xSrxCoO3-delta perovskites with x > 0 and for amorphous CoOOH increases the pre-exponential factor, which can be explained either by an increase of the concentration of active sites or by a change in the entropy of activation. However, changing the alkali cation results in a decrease of the apparent activation enthalpy for Fe-containing amorphous films, traducing a change in intermediates' binding energies.									21	0	0	0	3	0	20			2155-5435			WOS:000526395000018

Water electrolysis is a key process in hydrogen generation, but electrolyzers face a couple technological hurdles before widespread integration could occur. Understanding morphology evolution and transport processes in an operating polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is key to reducing cost and increasing efficiency. In this study, combined operando X-ray computed tomography and radiography are used to study transport and degradation in PEM electrolyzers subject to applied current densities. Tomography enables three-dimensional steady-state imaging but does not capture transport subtleties. Radiography is limited to two-dimensions but does capture transient phenomena. The tomography results depict degradation of the catalyst layer on the anode side of the electrolyzer. The rate of degradation was observed to increase as the applied current density increased. The catalyst particle detachment is due to autonomous propulsion during the oxygen evolution reaction. Particles that mechanically rip off the membrane were observed to be redeposited into the porous transport layer. During radiography, sub-second exposure time is required to capture the transient behavior of oxygen evolution, even at the lower current densities (50-200 mAcm(-2)). Various flow regimes were observed in the channel ranging from bubbly to slug flow depending on current density. Experimental observations agree with a model that an increase in current density increases oxygen bubble diameter and decreases bubble residence time within the electrolyzer channel.

The excellent performance is attributed to the large exposed surface, low coordination number, moderate hydrogen adsorption energy, and low charge transfer resistance.									18	2	0	0	3	0	19			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000490309200001

In the current work, a new technique of fac-[Ir(H2O)(3)(NO2)(3)] preparation based on hydrothermal treatment of (NH4)(3)[Ir(NO2)(6)] was developed. For this purpose, the influence of reaction parameters such as the reaction time, temperature, and pH of the solution on the process of hexanitroiridate salt hydrolysis was investigated. The synthesized fac-[Ir(H2O)(3)(NO2)(3)] solution in this optimized way was used for the preparation of the series of Ir/g-C3N4 catalysts, which were evaluated in the water oxidation reaction with NaIO4 utilized as a sacrificial reagent. A 20-fold enhancement of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity was found to take place under visible light (lambda = 411 nm) illumination of the systems. The highest rate of the photoinduced OER per iridium center was achieved by the Ir-0.005/g-C3N4 (air, 400 degrees C) catalyst with an exceptional turnover frequency value of 967 min(-1) approaching the activity of known homogeneous iridium OER catalysts. The leaching experiments have shown that aquated Ir species are generated in a solution after prolonged functioning of the catalysts. Despite this, in the closed system the photodriven OER activity persists at a steady-state level evidencing an equilibrium achieved between dissolved and anchored Ir species forming catalytic tandem with the g-C3N4.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000842705700001	35881890

Herein, C-coated CoP hollow microporous nanocages (C-CoP-1/12) are synthesized by calcination of a Prussian blue analog precursor and subsequent phosphorization treatment. Under alkaline condition, the C-CoP-1/12 exhibit splendid electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 173 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 333 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The C-CoP-1/12 show high electrocatalytic performance for overall water splitting at a low potential of only 1.650 V for the driving current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and they exhibit remarkable stability for at least 24 h. The engineering of phosphating is the critical step for the synthesis of pure-phase CoP with hollow nanoarchitecture. Compared with Co2P, CoP possesses lower water dissociation barrier and favorable Delta G(H)* value according to theoretical calculations, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance. Such impressive water splitting performance is mainly attributed to the collective effects of metal phosphide with unique electronic structure, the shortened electron transport paths, and the conductive C coating. This strategy is believed to provide a basis for the development of electrode materials with highly efficient electrocatalytic water-splitting capability.									37	3	0	0	4	0	37			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000496763600040	31506661

The Ni and NiO compositions were controlled by varying the temperature during pyrolysis, which had significant effects on the crystallographic structure of the resulting hybrid and electrocatalytic properties. The Ni/NiO/N-doped activated carbon obtained at 500 degrees C shows modest Tafel slopes of 70 and 121 mV dec(-1) along with overpotentials of 346 and 180 mV to drive a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) for oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. In a two-electrode electrolyser the hybrid bifunctional electrocatalyst requires only 1.688 V to reach 10 mAcm(-2) current density, confirming excellent rate capability and robust stability with variable current densities of 10-30 mA cm(-2). The electrocatalytic performance of the NiOx-AC-500 parallel to NiOx-AC-500 cell is comparable to that of recently reported electrolysers. The superior electrocatalytic performance of our electrocatalyst is due to synergies between Ni and NiO in a hierarchically porous N-doped carbon structure, rich in active sites and efficient charge transfer. This work offers a sustainable approach to develop eco-friendly bifunctional electrocatalysts for high-performance water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, newly designed three transition metal-based phosphonate materials i.e., cobalt phosphonate (CoEDA), nickel phosphonate (NiEDA), and nickel-cobalt phosphonate (NiCoEDA), were synthesized using etidronic acid (1-Hydroxyethane 1,1-diphosphonic acid) as the organophosphorus source under hydrothermal reaction condition at pH 6.5. Among these materials, CoEDA exhibits a high surface area with a proper microporous channel, one of the key parameters for showing excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a lower overpotential (318 mV) and Tafel slope (70.1 mV dec(-1)). The superior catalytic activity towards OER can be correlated with the presence of the organic-inorganic hybrid material containing Co-O-P bond and the formation of highly electroactive cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) species onto the pore wall of the microporous channel. Besides, as-synthesized CoEDA catalyst displays outstanding catalytic stability for 25 h with a change in current density of only 6%.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805328600003

Due to Ni(Fe)OOH's layered structure, electrolyte species are able to easily intercalate between the octahedrally coordinated sheets. Electrolyte cations have long been considered inert spectator ions during electrocatalysis, but electrolytes that penetrate into the catalyst may play a major role in the reaction process. In a joint theoretical and experimental study, we report the role of electrolyte counterions (K+, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) on Ni(Fe)OOH catalytic activity in alkaline media. We show that electrolytes containing alkali metal cations (Na+ and K+) yield dramatically lower overpotentials than those with alkaline earth cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+). K+ and Na+ lower the overpotential because they have an optimal acidity and size that allows them to not bind too strongly or alter the stability of reaction intermediates. These two features required for intercalated cation species provide insight into selecting appropriate electrolytes for layered catalyst materials, and enable understanding the role(s) of electrolytes in the OER mechanism.									69	1	0	0	4	0	70			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000403530600019

Therefore, replacing the OER with a more favorable anodic oxidation reaction with remarkable kinetics is of paramount significance, especially the one that can produce value-added chemicals. Moreover, time-saving and cost-effective strategies for the fabrication of electrodes are helpful for the wide application of electrolysis. Herein, thermodynamically more favorable iodide electrooxidation over Ni doped Co(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays (NSAs) in alkaline solution is presented as the alternative to the OER to boost the HER. And the active species are determined to be the reverse redox of the Co(iv)/Co(iii) couple. Remarkably, a negative shift of voltage of 320 mV is observed at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) after using iodide electrolysis to replace ordinary water splitting. The synthetic strategy and iodide oxidation in this work expand the application of Co-based materials in the field of energy-saving hydrogen production.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			2516-0230			WOS:000611877100031	36131743

Compared with the crystalline catalyst, the amorphous catalyst has larger specific surface area and structural defects under the same mass, which makes it more active sites for the catalytic reaction. In addition, the excellent flexibility and flexibility of the amorphous catalyst can induce the active sites to form suitable morphology for promoting the reaction rate due to its uniformity and isotropy, which can adjust their catalytic conditions and provide volume and capacity according to the surface electron transfer, promoting the electrocatalytic activities of hydrogen evolution reaction(HER)and oxygen evolution reaction(OER)in water splitting. Herein, the latest progress in several major types of the amorphous catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting in recent years was reviewed, especially in the controllable synthesis of several kinds of amorphous catalysts, the control strategy on electrocatalytic performance for water decomposition, and the structure-activity relationship between surface electronic structure and catalytic activity and stability. Moreover, the prospects for the challenges and research direction of the adaptation relationship and modulation of the active site of the catalysts were proposed to shed light on further development of electrolysis water.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-0609			INSPEC:21772808

BCMEs possess water and oil nanochannels, and therefore, both hydrophilic and lipophilic precursors can be used. Thus, PtAq-CoAq, PtAq-CoOi, PtOi-CoAq and PtOi-CoOi were prepared (where Aq and Oi stand for the precursor present in aqueous or oily phase, respectively). The characterization of the Pt-Co3O4-HS confirmed the formation of metallic Pt and Co3O4 whose composition and morphology are controlled by the initial pH and precursor combination, determining the presence of the reducing/precipitant species in the reaction media. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt-Co3O4-HSs for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH and compared with Pt-HS. The lowest onset overpotentials for Pt-Co3O4-Hs were achieved with PtOi-CoOi (1.46 V vs. RHE), while the lowest overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) was obtained for the PtAq-CoAq (381 mV). Tafel slopes were 102, 89, 157 and 92 mV dec(-1), for PtAq-CoAq, PtAq-CoOi, PtOi-CoAq and PtOi-CoOi, respectively. The Pt-Co3O4-HSs showed a better performance than Pt-HS. Our work shows that the properties and performance of metal-metal oxide HSs obtained in BCMEs depend on the phases in which the precursors are present.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2073-4344		WOS:000592998700001

The obvious preparation strategy is to load metal-based compounds on the non-metal element doped carbon catalyst. A compact interface between heterogeneous materials is the key to obtain efficient performance. Herein, the cobalt-boron-oxide nanosheets were embedded into the N, P dual-doped carbon nanosheets, and a compact composite catalyst (Co-B-O/NPC) was constructed using boron as a medium. The Co-B-O/NPC-50% catalyst exhibits the ORR catalytic activity surpassing Pt/C catalyst, the OER catalytic activity exceeding RuO2, and the excellent catalytic activity of HER. These three catalytic performances originated from synergy also exhibit good stabilities. The rechargeable zinc-air battery using Co-B-O/NPC-50% as the electrocatalyst exhibits the power density of 110.7 mW/cm(2) and a stable charge-discharge cycling of more than 60 h. The overall water-splitting electrolyzer using Co-B-O/NPC as sole catalyst also exhibits excellent performance and stability. A complex energy-system that combines Zn-air battery, illumination and water-splitting was built due to trifunctional characteristics. This work not only presents a novel preparation strategy, but also can deepen the understanding of the structure-activity relationship of trifunctional electro-catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The metal oxides or hydroxides formed on their surface during the OER process are hypothesized to play an important role. However, their exact role is yet to be elucidated. Here unambiguous justification regarding the active role of oxo(hydroxo) species on O-Ni(1-x)FexP2 nanosheet with pyrite structure is shown. These O-Ni(1-x)FexP2 (x = 0.25) nanosheets demonstrate greatly improved OER performance than their corresponding hydroxide and oxide counterparts do. From density function theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that the introduction of iron into the pyrite-phased NiP2 alters OER steps occurred on the surface. Notably, the partially oxidized surface of O-Ni(1-x)FexP2 nanosheets is vital to improve the local environment and accelerate the reaction steps. This study sheds light on the OER mechanism of the 3d TMP electrocatalyst and opens up a way to develop efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts.									83	5	0	0	7	0	83			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000434031400023

A fundamental understanding of the atomic-scale reaction mechanism during OER could drive further progress, but a stable model system has yet to be provided. Here we show that Fe3O4 single crystal surfaces, prepared in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) are stable in alkaline electrolytein the range pH 7-14 and under OER conditions in 1 M NaOH. Fe3O4(001) and Fe3O4(110) surfaces were studied with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, and scanning tunneling microscopy in UHV, and atomic force microscopy in air. Fe3O4(110) is found to be more reactive for oxidative water splitting than (001)-oriented magnetite samples. Magnetite is electrically conductive, and the structure and properties of its major facets are well understood in UHV. With these newly obtained results, we propose magnetite (Fe3O4) as a promising model system for further mechanistic studies of electrochemical reactions in alkaline media and under highly oxidizing conditions.									23	2	0	0	0	0	23			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000463844500079

Herein, we report the construction of intrinsically metallic NiCoSe2 on carbon cloth with a crimped nanosheet configuration and highly open structure. This unique morphology endows NiCoSe2 with superhydrophilic properties, leading to close affinity with the electrolyte. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the combined contribution of Ni and Co elements to the electronic structure of the bimetallic selenides, revealing the strong interaction of the two metals toward enhanced electrical conductivity. Benefiting from the cooperative effects of the structural features, metallic nature and bimetal effect, NiCoSe2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance and robust durability toward overall water splitting, especially toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a low overpotential of 255.8 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) current density, indicating its enticing prospect in water electrolysis.									71	3	0	0	1	0	71			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448147200011

However, it is limited by the slow kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which can be improved using catalysts. Covalent organic framework (COF)-derived porous carbon can serve as an excellent catalyst support. Here, we report high electrocatalytic activity of two composites, formed by supporting RuO2 on carbon derived from two COFs with closely related structures. These composites catalyze oxygen evolution from alkaline media with overpotentials as low as 210 and 217 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), respectively. The Tafel slopes of these catalysts (65 and 67 mV/dec) indicate fast kinetics compared to commercial RuO2. The observed activity is the highest among all RuO2-based heterogeneous OER catalysts-a touted benchmark OER catalyst. The high catalytic activity arises from the extremely small-sized (similar to 3-4 nm) RuO2 nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed in a micro-mesoporous (BET = 517 m(2)/g) COF-derived carbon. The porous graphenic carbon favors mass transfer, while its N-rich framework anchors the catalytic nanoparticles, making it highly stable and recyclable. Crucially, the soft pyrolysis of the COF enables the formation of porous carbon and simultaneous growth of small RuO2 particles without aggregation.									22	1	0	0	1	0	22			2470-1343			WOS:000483407600052	31460475

Ozone density is measured by the laser absorption method, and OH density is measured by the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) method. A 100-ns pulsed corona discharge occurs between a series of 25 needle electrodes and a plate electrode. After the pulsed discharge, the time evolutions of ozone and OH densities are measured in humid air or a humid nitrogen-oxygen mixture. Results show that the addition of 2.4% water vapor to dry air reduces ozone production by a factor of about 6, and shortens the ozone formation time constant from 30 to 6 mus. Water vapor may reduce atomic oxygen levels leading to the decreased production of ozone by O+O-2 reaction. The LIF measurement for OH radicals shows that OH density is approximately constant for 10 mus after the pulsed discharge, then decays by recombination reaction and reactions with the discharge products of oxygen, such as ozone or atomic oxygen. Absolute OH density is estimated; it is about 3x10(15) cm(-3) in streamers at 10 mus after discharge in the H2O(2.4%)/N-2 mixture.

For geopolymers and cements, the H(2)produced by radiolytic processes is a key factor because of the large amount of water present in their porous structure. Herein, the gas composition evolution around geopolymers was monitored online under(60)Co gamma irradiation. The transient evolution of the hydrogen release yield was measured for samples with different formulations. Its evolution and the final values are consistent with the presence of a pseudo-first-order chemical reaction consuming hydrogen in the samples. The results show that this phenomenon can significantly reduce the hydrogen source term of geopolymer wasteform provided their diffusion coefficient remains low. Lower hydrogen production rates and faster kinetics were observed with geopolymer formulations in which pore water pH was higher. Besides hydrogen release, a steady oxygen consumption was observed for all geopolymer samples. The oxygen consumption rates are proportional to the diffusion coefficients estimated in the modelization of hydrogen recombination by a pseudo-first-order reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0022-3131	1881-1248		WOS:000560568600001

Here, core-shell-structured CoPx@FeOOH is designed for selective OER in seawater. This catalyst has high conductivity, large surface area, improved turnover frequency, and optimal absorption energy to OER intermediates, which together lead to excellent catalytic activity. The enhanced chemical stability and corrosion resistance ensure its catalytic performance in seawater. Specifically, it requires overpotentials of 283 and 337 mV to attain current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, in 1 M KOH seawater, with durability over 80 h of continuous testing without producing any hypochlorite. The CoPx||CoPx@FeOOH pair requires voltages of 1.710 and 1.867 V to attain current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2 with a high Faradaic efficiency, showing its great promise for fuel-gas production from seawater.									42	2	0	0	2	0	43			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000651749400004

Yet still, it remains unclear how the TMPs work synergistically with the N-doped support, and which N configuration (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, or graphitic N) contributes predominantly to the synergy. Here we present a HER electrocatalyst (denoted as MoP@NCHSs) comprising MoP nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon hollow spheres, which displays excellent activity and stability for HER in alkaline media. Results of experimental investigations and theoretical calculations indicate that the synergy between MoP and the pyridinic N can most effectively promote the HER in alkaline media.									181	15	0	0	21	0	182			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000488593600001	31515887

Herein, discarded biomass (pomelo peel, PP) is used as raw material and in-situ grew NiFe-Prussian blue analogues on its surface. Then a novel 3D binder-free and self standing NiFe@NC/PPC electrode is obtained through the carbonization process and directly used as a cathode in Li-O-2 batteries.Compared with PPC (carbonized pomelo peel) and NiFe@NC/CP (NiFe@NC catalysts coated on carbon paper), NiFe@NC/PPC gathered the advantageous characteristics of i) efficient diffusion rates for O-2/electrolyte and ii) good catalytic activity for oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER). The as fabricated Li-O-2 batteries, with NiFe@NC/PPC as cathode, are performed a relatively high specific capacity (13.79 mAh cm(-2)), a long cycle life (290 cycles) at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2). Therefore, considering the convenience of synthesis method and the inexpensive raw materials, this is a feasible way to prepare high performance and low cost cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries.									35	3	0	0	3	0	37			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000467661700072

At the core of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction conversion efficiency are interfacial processes with complex dynamic mechanisms, whose further acceleration is practically impossible without a thorough fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis. Here, we communicate new experimental insights into HER, which will potentially further deepen our general understanding of electrocatalysis. Of special note is the very surprising observation that the most active metals (i.e., noble metals) for HER, which exhibit the lowest overpotentials at a defined current density, exhibit the highest activation energies in comparison to the other metals from the d-block. This suggests a major, if not dominant, impact of the frequency factor on activity trends and the need for deeper reconsideration of the origins of electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000862869900001

However, oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a slow four-electron progress, is the bottle neck of water splitting. Thus, developing new, low cost, and effective catalysts for OER is a research hotspot in material and energy resource fields. Therefore, the research of nonprecious, metal-based OER catalysts has been popular. In this work, it is validated that 3D hollow Co(OH)(2) nanoflowers synthesized by a facile template-based strategy at room temperature are effective electrocatalysts for OER. The catalysts display high activity with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 310 mV and a small Tafel slope of 68.9 mV/dec in alkaline condition. It's noteworthy that this material is stable for over 20 h of chronopotentiometry. This work offers a simple and promising way to prepare efficient and durable electrocatalysts.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000427606100007

The earth-abundant transition-metal chalcogenides (TMCs) possess unique properties to realize hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but the semiconductor 2H phase behaves a medial activity for HER and even worse performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To date, developing the efficient and bifunctional TMCs electrocatalyst is an attractive but difficult task. Herein, Co-doped 1T'/T phase dominated MoS1+xSe1+Y alloy (Co-MoS1+xSe1+Y) nanosheets electrocatalysts were synthesized by a onestep facial hydrothermal method. Meanwhile, the crystal structures and element composition of the Co-MoS1+xSe1+Y were determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman spectroscopy. Importantly, the as-prepared catalysts Co-MoS(1+x)Se(1+Y )with the atomic ratio of Co: Mo = 1: 5 (MoS(1+x)Se(1+Y)1-5) shows superior electrochemical activity, achieving current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) at small overpotentials of 119 mV and 280 mV for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Moreover, applying the bifunctional electrode in an alkaline water electrolytic cell allows a high-efficiency electrocatalyst with only 1.60 V at j = 10 mA cm(-2), which could be practical in electrocatalytic overall water splitting reaction devices.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000523184600015

However, the state-of-the-art GDY-based electrocatalysts still suffer from weak catalytic activity and sluggish reaction kinetics originating from the severe scarcity of in-plane active sites and insufficient electrical conductivity. Targeted at this bottleneck issue, electronic structure regulation, recognized as an extremely precise technical route, is promising to improve HER performances of carbon-based electrocatalysts. Herein, a facile controllable chemical etching strategy is well leveraged to introduce sp(2)-hybridized carbon-oxygen bonds (Csp(2)-O) into GDY for precise manipulation both of its electronic and spatial structures. Experimental results and theoretical calculations coherently manifest that Csp(2)-O introduction into GDY can not only induce its electronic structure upheaval to strengthen surface electron transport capability, but also trigger intensive carbon-oxygen p-p orbital hybridization to enhance the catalytic activity of acetylenic bond sites. As a result, the optimal GDY sample after etching delivers excellent HER performance with an overpotential of only 101 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1), which surpasses most of reported metal-free based electrocatalysts. This work provides a universal route for precise modulation of inherent electronic structure in GDY, and can be further extended to boost the overall performances of other carbon-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2053-1583			WOS:000743711900001

Currently, hydrogen production via water electrolysis yields high hydrogen purity with easy operation and without producing polluting side products. Presently, platinum group metals and their oxides are the most effective catalysts for water splitting; however, their low abundance and high cost hinder large-scale hydrogen production, especially in alkaline and neutral media. Therefore, the development of high-efficiency, durable, and low-cost electrocatalysts is crucial to improving the overpotential and lowering the electrical energy consumption. As a solution, Ni2P has attracted particular attention, owing to its desirable electrical conductivity, high corrosion resistance, and remarkable catalytic activity for overall water splitting, and thus, is a promising substitute for platinum-group catalysts. However, the catalytic performance and durability of raw Ni2P are still inferior to those of noble metal-based catalysts. Heteroatom doping is a universal strategy for enhancing the performance of Ni2P for water electrolysis over a wide pH range, because the electronic structure and crystal structure of the catalyst can be modulated, and the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates can be adjusted via doping, thus optimizing the reaction performance. In this review, first, the reaction mechanisms of water electrolysis, including the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction and anodic oxygen evolution reaction, are briefly introduced. Then, progress into heteroatom-doped nickel phosphide research in recent years is assessed, and a discussion of each representative work is given. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for developing advanced Ni2P based electrocatalysts are proposed and discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

The OER catalytic activity as well as electrolysis energy efficiency surpasses any previously reported OER electrocatalyst in alkaline medium and energy efficiency of an electrolyzer using state-of-the-art Pt and RuO2 as the HER and OER catalyst, respectively. Through detailed electrochemical and structural characterization, we have shown that the enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to directional growth of the electrodeposited film that exposes a Ni-rich lattice plane as the terminating plane, as well as increased covalency of the selenide lattice which decreases the Ni(II) to Ni(III) oxidation potential. Thereby, the high efficiency along with extended stability makes NiSe2 as the most efficient water electrolyzer known to-date.									76	3	0	0	4	0	77			2045-2322			WOS:000401962500005	28546568

In this paper, the coupling effects of pH and dissolved oxygen on the corrosion behavior and mechanism of X80 steel in an acidic soil simulated solution were further analyzed by electrochemical methods and three-dimensional video microscope. Results showed that the hydrogen reduction reaction was almost the only cathode process in the anoxic and low pH system, and small and dense pits were present on the electrode surface. pH value increased, the pits decreased, but the size of pits increased. In the oxygen-adequate system, oxygen-consuming (OC) corrosion preferentially occurred, and a protective corrosion product layer (including FeOOH, Fe3O4, etc.) might be formed accordingly, but the proportion of hydrogen evolution (HE) increased and the product layer had defects at a low pH environment. The specific corrosion mechanism of X80 steel in an acidic soil simulated solution is described in the relevant models.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16				1996-1944		WOS:000493308500124	31569781

Although platinum is a representative cocatalyst for many heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions, it has not been used for photocatalytic water splitting, owing to its high catalytic activity for the reverse reaction of water splitting. In the present study, platinum nanoparticles were loaded as a cocatalyst on a calcium titanate photocatalyst by a conventional impregnation method and a photodeposition method and examined for photocatalytic water splitting in a flow of water vapor. Platinum nanoparticles loaded by the impregnation method were found to retain the oxidized form on the calcium titanate photocatalyst, even under photoirradiation, and promoted hydrogen and oxygen production by photocatalytic water vapor splitting without promoting the reverse reaction.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000471314900019	30803147

Reduction in dry CO occurs already slightly above 300 K, yielding CO2 by reaction with reactive lattice oxygen. Replenishment of any lattice oxygen species by defect quenching with CO2 is strongly suppressed. Adsorption of dry CO or CO2 leads to formation of weakly (monodentate HCO3) or more strongly bound carbonate species (bidentate or bridged CO3), for CO at least partly via reaction with lattice oxygen to CO2 (gas) and readsorption of CO2 (gas) on the In2O3 surface. Whereas CO2 evolution via reaction of a CO + H2O mixture on In2O3 starts at 430 K and accelerates above 550 K, only trace amounts of CO are formed upon reaction in a CO2 Hi mixture. Formaldehyde is converted with 95% selectivity to CO2 under typical steam reforming conditions and temperatures of similar to 550 K, i.e., at rates and selectivities comparable to methanol.									51	5	0	0	0	0	52			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000289215400060

The obtained Fe-P/WO2 composite possesses stable high HER catalytic performance. The over potential (eta(10)) and Tafel slope of the sample Fe-P/WO2 were only 48 mV and 19 mV.dec(-1) higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalyst, respectively. The excellent HER catalytic activity of Fe-P/WO2 composite is due to the synergetic catalytic effect between WO2 and the doped heterogeneous medium.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0366-7022	1348-0715		WOS:000487252500009

To settle such issue, for the first time, FeNi alloy nanosphere homogenously embedded porous nitrogen-doped nanocarbon (FeNi@NC) hybrid has been synthesized by pyrolyzing a precursor composite composed of nickel hexacyanoferrate and nitrogen-doped nanocarbon under the inert atmospheres without any further post-treatments. The as-prepared uniform FeNi alloy nanosphere embedded porous nitrogen-doped nanocarbon (FeNi@NC) hybrid exhibits a very low over-potential of 298 mV (vs. RHE) at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) , a small Tafel slope of 48.4 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability after 1.26 x 10(5) s (more than 35 h) at 10 mA cm(-2) towards OER. In addition, the mass normalized activity of FeNi@NC hybrid measured at fixed potential of 1.7 V (vs. RHE) is 295.9 A g(-1). The outstanding OER performance can be attributed to the porous nitrogen-doped nanocarbon structure, high specific surface area as well as good electrical conductivity. The results indicate that this work provides a new strategy to fabricate other transition bimetallic alloy embedded porous nitrogen-doped nanocarbon hybrid as OER electrocatalysts in the further.

Herein, a novel strategy based on spatially shaped femtosecond laser ablation pretreatment is proposed for constructing self-supported cobalt oxide electrocatalysts with hierarchical chestnut burr-like nanostructures on a copper substrate. The femtosecond laser ablation can create pinning and attachment sites for the growth of nanowires to form stable self-supported structures. Due to the hierarchical three-dimensional fluffy structures and tight adhesion between active materials and substrates, the prepared self-supported electrocatalysts can provide rapid charge transfer, a large surface area with ample active sites, accelerated electrolyte diffusion, effective catalytic components, and high conductivity during the electrocatalytic process. Naturally, the self-supported electrode demonstrated favorable electrocatalytic properties in alkaline solutions (1 M KOH), presenting low overpotentials of 105 and 235 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Moreover, the constructed electrolyzer system with the self-supported electrocatalysts can facilitate overall water splitting at the low cell voltage of 1.51 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibits durability for up to 72 h, indicating a high level of activity and stability for water electrolysis. This work presents a novel perspective for the construction of electrocatalysts structures with stable and efficient properties.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773586700001

Herein, novel porous disk-like nanostructured CoP (CoP NDs) were synthesized by a facile strategy involving precipitation, ammonia-etching and phosphidation steps. Endowed with abundant catalytically active sites and enriched nanoporosity, the CoP NDs show excellent bifunctional catalytic performances toward both HER and OER, which are comparable and even superior to those of the recently reported noble-metal-free electrocatalysts. Consequently, an efficent water electrolyzer composed of two symmetrical CoP ND electrodes can afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.62 V.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2398-4902			WOS:000526855200007

Significant efforts were dedicated recently to developing cheap and efficient earth-abundant electrocatalysts to make electrolyzed hydrogen economically competitive. Notwithstanding substantial progress, the operational voltage of water splitting in a single electrolyte system is still high, even highly efficient electrocatalysts are used to catalyze the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Taking into account that the HER and the OER are kinetically favorable in electrolytes with different pH values, in this work we demonstrate that overall water splitting can be accomplished in acid-alkaline dual electrolytes with an onset voltage as low as 1.13 V, enabled by a bipolar membrane (BPM) under the "reverse bias" condition with the novel dual-phase cobalt phosphide-cobalt ditelluride (CoP-CoTe2) nanowires being used as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts. Furthermore, we show that using a BPM under the "forward bias" the voltages needed to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) can be reduced to 1.01 and 1.37 V, respectively, due to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization resulting from the crossover of electrolytes. The bipolar membrane water electrolysis (BPMWE) can be sustained for at least 100 h without notable degradation.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663706300005

The composition changes of electrolyte in three compartments were tested as function of time to study ion transport in the electrodeposition process deeply. The results show that chloride ions are able to migrate and diffuse from the catholyte to the middle solution by the electric field and concentration gradient; similarly, protons are also able to migrate and diffuse from the anolyte to the middle solution. Hence hydrochloric acid forms electrochemically up to lmol/L, simultaneously obtaining oxygen evolution reaction instead of chlorine evolution at the anode. The production of acid is synchronized with the inhibition of chlorine evolution.									1	5	0	0	0	0	5			1004-0609			INSPEC:17051161

Due to the sluggish OER kinetics, searching for efficient low-cost non-precious metal catalysts is one of the crucial but very challenging steps. Herein, V2C MXene synergistically coupled with hypophosphiteintercalated FeNi (oxy)hydroxide (H2PO2-/FeNi-LDH-V2C) electrocatalyst is synthesized. The H2PO2-/FeNiLDH-V2C exhibits excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 250 mV (eta 10) and small Tafel slope of 46.5 mV dec- 1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, and excellent rechargeable Zn-air battery performance with superior open circuit potential (1.42 eV), power density (137 mW cm-2) and well durability. The strong interaction and electronic coupling with prominent charge-transfer between FeNi-LDHs and V2C MXene endow the composite significant OER performance and structural stability, and the adsorption/desorption balance for the OER reaction pathway, eventually promoting the intrinsic activity. This work demonstrates the great promise of MXene-based nanohybrids as advanced electrocatalysts for renewable energy applications.									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702068100001

The clay minerals including bentonite and kaolinite are rich with plenty of active centers and favorable chemical composition for the catalysis applications but limited by the insulating properties, thus they cannot be used as an electrode material for the water splitting. The unique presence of clay minerals in the form of pencil graphite rod (PGR) and its attractive architecture enabled us to exploit advantageous features and use them as an in situ electrode for growth of metal oxide nanostructures for the electrolysis applications. The naturally inherent presence of SiO2 favors the catalytic properties and durability of the electrode whereas the MgO produces the abundant oxygen vacancies and Co3 thorn ions for OER process. Herein, we present a facile approach of using PGR as host substrate and co-catalyst for the loading of Co3O4, NiCo2O4 and NiO nanostructures and the modified electrode carried high porosity for easily bubbling of oxygen gas, plenty of intrinsic active centers coming from both clay minerals and metal oxides for excellent OER process. The fabricated electrode is physically well-characterized, and it has a natural ability to sustain a long term stability even at higher current densities and industrial electrolyzer conditions. The NiCo2O4/PGR, Co3O4/PGR, and NiO/PGR electrodes exhibit an overpotential of 234, 242 and 272 mV respectively at a current density of 100 mAcm-2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolytic solution. The presence of large number of oxygen vacancies through SiO2 and MgO, high Ni2 thorn /Ni3 thorn and Co3 thorn /Co2 thorn ratios, multi metal centers, large specific surface area, high pore volume, high electrochemical active surface area and fast charge transport within the NiCo2O4/PGR are the main reasons for its superfast OER kinetics. Thus, the proposed method of electrode design will pave a potential way for high performance electrochemical devices like metal air batteries, fuel cell and supercapacitors.

The doping amount of niobium (5, 10, 20 at. %) was emphatically investigated to evaluate the effects on nanostructure, morphology, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Nb-doped titania supported IrO2. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that IrO2 supported by Nb-doped titania exhibits grain refinement and uniform dispersion. An investigation of the electrocatalytic activity by half-cell electrochemical testing reveals that the Nb-doped titania supported IrO2 catalyst demonstrates significant OER activity. When the Nb content reaches 20 at. % in the support, the Nb-doped titania supported IrO2 possesses the highest OER activity, which is superior to that of pristine titania supported IrO2 and unsupported IrO2. The single-cell tests also prove that 20 at. % is the best Nb doping amount for titania supports of IrO2. It is found that the majority of the OER activity increase is due to the Nb-doping induced enhancement of the specific surface area and surface activity of transferring charge and species. The additional specific surface area and redox couples of Nb(IV)/Nb(V) are also responsible for this performance enhancement. Herein, the as-synthesized Nb-doped titania is considered to be a promising oxygen evolution catalyst support for SPEWE applications.									39	1	0	0	2	0	39			2168-0485			WOS:000371755400017

Here, we report layer-by-layer in situ growth of low-level Fe-doped Ni-layered double hydroxide (Ni1-xFex-LDH) and Co-layered double hydroxide (Co1-xFex-LDH), respectively, with three-dimensional microflower and one-dimensional nanopaddy-like morphologies on Ni foam, by a one-step eco-friendly hydrothermal route. In this work, an interesting finding is that both N1-xFex-LDH and Co1-xFex-LDH materials are very active and efficient for OER as well as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic activities in alkaline medium. The electrochemical studies demonstrate that Co1-xFex-LDH material exhibits very low OER and HER overpotentials of 249 and 273 mV, respectively, at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2), whereas Ni1-xFex-LDH exhibits 297 and 319 mV. To study the overall water-splitting performance using these electrocatalysts as anode and cathode, three types of alkaline electrolyzers are fabricated, namely, Co1-xFex-LDH(+) parallel to Co1-xFex-LDH (-), Ni1-xFex-LDH(+) parallel to Ni1-xFex-LDH(-), and Co1-xFex-LDH(+) parallel to Ni1-xFex-LDH(-). These electrolyzers require only a cell potential (E-cell) of 1.60, 1.60, and 1.59 V, respectively, to drive the benchmark current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Another interesting finding is that their catalytic activities are enhanced after stability tests. Systematic analyses are carried out on both electrodes after all electrocatalytic activity studies. The developed three types of electrolyzers to produce H-2, are very efficient, cost-effective, and offer no complications in synthesis of materials and fabrication of electrolyzers, which can greatly enable the realization of clean renewable energy infrastructure.									72	1	0	0	9	0	72			1944-8244			WOS:000453488900067	30430830

Electrocatalysts accelerate the reaction by facilitating the required electron transfer(4), as well as the formation and rupture of chemical bonds(5). This involvement in fundamentally different processes results in complex electrochemical kinetics that can be challenging to understand and control, and that typically depends exponentially on overpotential(1,2,6,7). Such behaviour emerges when the applied bias drives the reaction in line with the phenomenological Butler-Volmer theory, which focuses on electron transfer(8), enabling the use of Tafel analysis to gain mechanistic insight under quasi-equilibrium(9-11) or steady-state assumptions(12). However, the charging of catalyst surfaces under bias also affects bond formation and rupture(13-15), the effect of which on the electrocatalytic rate is not accounted for by the phenomenological Tafel analysis(8) and is often unknown. Here we report pulse voltammetry and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements on iridium oxide to show that the applied bias does not act directly on the reaction coordinate, but affects the electrocatalytically generated current through charge accumulation in the catalyst. We find that the activation free energy decreases linearly with the amount of oxidative charge stored, and show that this relationship underlies electrocatalytic performance and can be evaluated using measurement and computation. We anticipate that these findings and our methodology will help to better understand other electrocatalytic materials and design systems with improved performance.Spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction establish that reaction rates depend on the amount of charge stored in the electrocatalyst, and not on the applied potential.									191	8	0	0	12	0	191			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000591335100022	33208960

Herein, porous cobalt/tungsten nitride (Co/WN) polyhedra were successfully synthesized by the growth of a polyhedral Co-W oxide precursor on Ni foam followed by a controlled nitridation as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for high-efficiency hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The porous structure of the Co/WN polyhedra can provide more reactive sites and promote mass/charge transfer. Moreover, the synergy between Co and WN can adjust the electronic structure, thus facilitating the adsorption/desorption of intermediates on the catalyst. Due to the above advantages, the optimized Co/WN polyhedra exhibit superior bifunctional performance in alkaline electrolyte with low overpotentials of 27 and 232 mV (without iR compensation) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. Especially, the Co/WN-600 sample shows better performance than commercial Pt/C and RuO2 at high current densities. Furthermore, the self-supported Co/WN polyhedra enable overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.51 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with outstanding catalytic durability.									23	2	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000589418400040

The thickness of the resulting films, whose use in electrocatalysis is unprecedented, is tuned by controlling the deposition time. The turnover frequency (TOF) for O-2 generation decreases drastically as the electrocatalyst amount increases from equivalent coverages of 3.5 monolayers (ML) for Fe(OH)(2) and of 0.06 ML for alpha-Co(OH)(2) electrodes. The contrasting behavior of both hydroxides comes from the different structure of the incipient deposits, formed by small acicular nanoparticles in the case of Fe(OH)(2) and larger flat microparticles in the case of alpha-Co(OH)(2). The former structure allows a large fraction of the Fe sites to be in direct contact with solution, while such a fraction rapidly diminishes with loading for alpha-Co(OH)(2). In addition, the resulting Co(OH)(2) electrodes show TOFs similar or higher than those of electrodes prepared by more complex routes. The optimum ultrathin films are remarkably stable in alkaline media, showing that the preparation of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution with an extremely small amount of metal through a novel, facile and scalable CBD is possible.

In order to improve electrocatalytic activity, it is necessary to design the structures and compositions of electrocatalysts. In this study, a series of multi-shelled CoxNi1-x oxide/phosphide hollow spheres with tunable element ratios were prepared. The electrocatalytic activity of the multi-shelled CoxNi1-x oxide/phosphide is strongly dependent on the molar ratio of Co and Ni. Based on the combined advantages of complex structures and compositions, the multi-shelled Co0.5Ni0.5 oxide/phosphide displays outstanding electrocatalytic performance in terms of high activity and stable durability for the OER, surpassing those of RuO2 and multi-shelled CoxNi1-x oxide/phosphide with other element ratios of Co and Ni. This result suggests a great possibility of rationally designing the composition for highly efficient electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000558102100024	32720957

The electrochemical activities of these carbide electrodes towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in concentrated phosphoric acid were investigated in a temperature range from 80 to 170 degrees C. A significant dependence of the activities on temperature was observed for all five carbide samples. Through the entire temperature range Group 6 metal carbides showed higher activity than that of the Group 5 metal carbides, attributable to the different electronic structures. Tungsten carbide among the studied electrode samples exhibited the highest HER activity. Upon anodic potential scans in the presence of oxygen, chromium, tantalum and tungsten carbides displayed passivation due to the formation of stable surface layers whereas niobium and molybdenum carbides seemed to undergo corrosion.

A long induction period which is hardly found in close-system appears in the presence of oxygen, and is affected by the concentration of chloroplatinic acid. The Pt cocatalyst is metal state and contributes to the electronic states near Fermi level judging from the valence band X-ray photoelectron spectrum. The cocatalyst metal Pt will reduce the surface photovoltage signals due to the metal feature. The hydrogen evolution rate increased and reached a platform with increasing the Pt coverage on the surface of photocatalyst which is characterized by the Pt:Ti atomic ratio.

The proposed heterostructure is fabricated via a facile chemical vapor deposition on Ni supported on graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) as a precursor. HER was an effect of photocatalytic water splitting and catalytic dehydrogenation of lactic acid used as sacrificial electron donor. However, photocatalysis played the dominant role in the acceleration of the reaction rate which was 17 times and 330 times higher in respect to the sample prior the CVD and to pristine GCN, respectively. The catalyst exhibited boosted electrocatalytic activity in OER and outstanding stability in respect to RuO2 in alkaline medium. The overpotentials calculated from linear sweep voltammetry at 10 mA cm(-2) is similar to 383 mV for the fabricated electrocatalyst in respect to 490 mV for the RuO2 and Tafel slope is calculated to be 106 mV dec(-1) in comparison to 136 mV dec(-1) for the reference which is above the state-of the-art bifunctional catalysts reported to date. The results reveal that the catalytic processes were boosted due to several key effects such as enhanced visible light absorption, better charge carriers transfer and separation, increased free charge carrier concentration and higher reducing ability of electrons.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000786612300001

In this study, np-Fe is easily fabricated using Fe-based metallic glass (Fe-MG) ribbons to prepare Fe-based nanocrystalline alloys as precursors after chemical dealloying in an HCl solution. The potential applications of np-Fe in energy conversion and environmental remediation are highlighted by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and dyeing wastewater treatment of an np-Fe800-12h. The results show that np-Fe has excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, np-Fe exhibits superior degradation capability toward azo dye pollutants and shows improved performance than even its nanocrystalline precursor and Fe-MG. This study thus paves a new avenue for fabricating the desired np-Fe as high-performance catalysts for energy conversion and wastewater treatment applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3093	1873-4812		WOS:000685507800003

Herein, we reported the Mn-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on flexible activated carbon cloth (Mn-CoP/CC) for the effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at low overpotential and high current density. Due to the novel 3D nanostructures of the carbon cloth and doping effect of the Mn clement, the Mn doped CoP/CC electrode delivered the best overpotential of 317 mV for water splitting with the current density of 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of similar to 65.1 mV/dec, and excellent stability over 16 h in 1.0 mol/L KOH, which is superior or comparable to the most of the reported cobalt-based catalysts. Thus outstanding electrocatalytic performance originates from the Mn doping effect, which resulted in increased surface area and fast charge-transfer. It is believed that these findings would help us to develop high effective and stable electrocatalysts for water splitting.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000432227700019

Here we suggest that the performance of NiFe-OH can be further enhanced by constructing pn junction. Using MnCo carbonate hydroxide (MnCo-CH)@NiFe-OH pn junction as a demonstration, we show that upon the construction of pn junction, the electrons flow from n-type NiFe-OH to MnCo-CH, which consequently generates a positively charged region on NiFe-OH. The density function theory calculation reveals that such an electronic property change results in an improved OER energetics. As a result, the MnCo-CH@NiFe-OH pn junction shows significantly enhanced OER performance that is -10 and -500 times that of NiFe-OH and MnCo-CH (in terms of the OER currents at the overpotential of 270 mV), respectively. Moreover, the pn junction also shows a greatly boosted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and therefore the overall water electrolysis activity that outperforms the Pt/C||RuO2 catalysts.									26	1	0	0	5	0	27			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663222200002

We have been proposing global carbon dioxide recycling to use renewable energy for all people in the whole world. The electricity converted from renewable energy will be used for production of hydrogen by seawater electrolysis. Hydrogen, for which no infrastructures of transportation and combustion exist, will be converted to methane by the reaction with carbon dioxide captured by energy consumers. Among systems in global carbon dioxide recycling, seawater electrolysis and carbon dioxide methanation have not been performed industrially. We created energy-saving cathodes for hydrogen production and anodes for oxygen evolution without chlorine formation in seawater electrolysis, and ideal catalysts for methane formation by the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen.

We find that the OER follows a bi-nuclear mechanism with adjacent top surface oxygen atoms as fixed adsorption sites, whereas the iridium atoms underneath play an indirect role and maintain their saturated 6-fold oxygen coordination at all stages of the reaction. The oxygen molecule is formed, via an Ir-OOOO-Ir transition state, by association of the outer oxygen atoms of two adjacent Ir-OO surface entities, leaving two intact Ir-O entities at the surface behind. This is drastically different from the commonly considered mono-nuclear mechanism where the O-2 molecule evolves by splitting of the Ir-O bond in an Ir-OO entity. We regard the rather weak reducibility of crystalline IrO2 as the reason for favoring the novel pathway, which allows the Ir-O bonds to remain stable and explains the outstanding stability of IrO2 under OER conditions. The establishment of surface oxygen atoms as fixed electrocatalytically active sites on a transition-metal oxide represents a paradigm shift for the understanding of water oxidation electrocatalysis, and it reconciles the theoretical understanding of the OER mechanism on iridium oxide with recently reported experimental results from operando X-ray spectroscopy. The novel mechanism provides an efficient OER pathway on a weakly reducible oxide, defining a new strategy towards the design of advanced OER catalysts with combined activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000792855000001	36204599

Herein, a composite of nickel-rich nickel nitride (NR-Ni3N) with graphitic carbon nitrides (GCNs) was prepared for the electrocatalytic OER, showing a low overpotential of similar to 290 mV, a small Tafel slope of similar to 70 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) current density, and low loss of activity after 36 h of test in an alkaline electrolyte, outperforming the pure Ni3N and even the noble catalyst RuO2. The characterization results revealed that the defective GCNs can promote the generation of a Ni-rich region in Ni3N in the nitridation process, and the high conductivity of the formed robust Ni-Ni3N heterojunction and its strong synergistic effect with GCNs explain the excellent OER electrocatalytic performances of NR-Ni3N/GCNs. This work provides a novel feasible strategy for the development of highly active OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000762953200013

However, current electrolyzers rely on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which has been expensive, location limited, high-risk, and generates low value (O-2) recovery. In this perspective review, we analyzed the state-of-the-art in electrolysis processes that use alternative anode reactions to improve the economic viability and scalability of water or CO2 electrolysis. We quantitatively compared a wide range of inorganic and organic electron donors in the anode that can lower energy costs and/or produce value-added products, and then assessed the use of different biotic and abiotic catalysts and the feasibility of using low-grade water sources as electrolytes. Through this wide-ranging assessment, we developed an example study for large-scale electrolysis in California, USA, provided long-term perspectives on OER substitutes for anode co-valorization, and delivered insight on future research directions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000703652800001

Upon exposure at moderate sample temperatures (298-423 K), numerous multilayer circular pits embedded in the reacted areas have been observed with the use of atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. These pits have diameters spanning nanometers to micrometers and depths from a few to tens of nanometers. The most striking characteristic of these pits is the convex curvature of the pit bottoms, where the highest point on the pit bottom is at the center and the lowest point occurs around the peripheral edge. Such structure arises by the interplay between kinetics of pit nucleation, the spatially anisotropic kinetics involved in the lateral and downward reactivity of HOPG, and the fluence of atomic oxygen. These kinetics, which are also influenced by the high reactivity of the translationally hot impinging oxygen atoms, govern the overall morphological evolution of the surface.									56	1	0	0	0	0	56			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000228847500026	16851995

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has long been the bottleneck of water splitting because of its high overpotential (eta) and sluggish kinetics, and development of efficient, stable, and non-noble-metal-based OER catalysts has been an extensively studied topic. Here, we propose short hydrogen bonds on reconstructed nanocrystal surface to enhance oxygen evolution activity by investigating three types of phase structures (beta(11), beta(I) and gamma(0)) of Li2CoSiO4 (LCS) nanoparticles as OER electrocatalysts. Among them, the beta(IL)-LCS outperforms the previously reported Co-based catalysts and the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst for OER in the alkaline condition. Our experiments combined with ab initio calculations indicated that due to the line-linked arrangement of Co active sites at the surface of beta(11)-LCS, short hydrogen bonds (2.54 angstrom) are formed and linked into a network at the reconstructed surface by rotating the flexible CoO4 tetrahedra after surface delithiation, thus facilitating proton transfer and dissociation, leading to a unique dual-center catalytic pathway with low theoretical thermodynamic overpotential (0.35 eV) for the OER process.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000419751100046

Molybdenum dissolution was studied in sodium nitrate solution under acidic (pH 1) and alkaline (pH 12) conditions at high current densities, which is typical for the industrial electrochemical machining process (ECM). The anodic oxygen evolution was evidenced by using the fluorescence quenching technique. The oxygen efficiency amounts to approximate to 1% at pH 12 and approximate to 7% at pH 1. These and considering previous results, lead to the assumption that a part of molybdenum does not dissolve as Mo6+. This agrees with oxidation of dissolved ions in a subsequently coupled amperometric cell at pH 12. The evolution of oxygen as well as supplementary material diagnostics clearly shows the (trans-)passive dissolution of molybdenum via the formation and dissolution of molybdenum oxide films under acidic as well as under alkaline conditions in sodium nitrate solutions. Considering all data, the authors conclude that the average valency is slightly lower than z = 5.5 at pH 1 and z = 5.9 at pH 12. The assumption of the partial dissolution of lower valent molybdenum ions is supported by the observation of a blue coloring of the remaining electrolyte on the sample surface after the experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0263-4368	2213-3917		WOS:000706677800002

Stress evolution during potential cycling reports on changes in oxidation state and oxide forms. Hysteresis observed in the potential-dependent stress from Ir, Au, and Pt electrodes is associated with chemical irreversibility in electrode composition and roughness., Alternatively Ni and Co exhibit reversible conversion between hydroxide and oxyhydroxide forms during cycling. From the experimentally determined stress, charge passed during electrode oxidation, and Young's modulus, the change in strain exhibited by Ni and Co electrodes during hydroxide-oxyhydroxide conversion is calculated to be 7.0% and 8.4%, respectively. We also show that the magnitude of change in stress is proportional to the amount of material that is further oxidized.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000345263300044	25343569

Structural, optical, electrochemical and photocatalytic properties of NiO/TiO2-CeO2 semiconductors were examined. The influence of different NiO contents on the electrocatalytic activity of NiO/TiO2-CeO2 samples was investigated in the oxygen evolution reaction and the results showed that the samples with the lowest NiO content have the highest electroactivity. The photocatalytic activity was determined during the phenol decomposition process over the samples with different NiO:TiO2-CeO2 ratios and the best photocatalytic activity is observed for the sample with 4.1 mol% NiO. The sample with the lowest NiO content obtained by a relatively simple method is suitable for use both as an electrode material in the oxygen evolution reaction and as a photocatalyst in the phenol decomposition process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1878-5190	1878-5204		WOS:000664398500001

Herein, we developed an approach to regulate the morphology and electronic structure of alpha-Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)x nanoplates, in which FeCl2 (as a precursor) plays a significant role under reflux conditions. The resulting 2D alpha-Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)x nanoplates exhibit more accessible edge active sites and more high-valence Co species to boost its intrinsic activity. Therefore, this electrocatalyst shows outstanding oxygen evolution reaction performance (with an overpotential of 225 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec-1 and good stability) and excellent activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (with an overpotential of 122 mV at 10 mA cm-2) in 1M KOH solution. When employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts on both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, alpha-Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)x can afford 10 mA cm-2 at 1.62 V with long-term stability. The one-pot synthesis of 2D Fe-doped transition-metal hydroxide nanoplates enriched with abundant edge sites may provide a new strategy for fabricating efficient overall water splitting catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			INSPEC:19558667

XRD analysis and high-resolution SEM observation using low accelerated incident beam revealed that decreasing Ir ratio made a phase transition of IrO2 from crystalline to partly amorphous, and nano IrO2 particles of 10 nm or less and nano chains made of them, which were uniformly dispersed on the flat area of the coating, were generated at 50-60 mol% Ir. The relationship between nano-scale surface morphology of the coating and electrocatalysis for oxygen evolution in H2SO4 solutions was also investigated. The active surface area and oxygen evolution current increased with reducing Jr ratio. The electrocatalysis of the IrO2-Ta2O5 coatings for oxygen evolution is possible to be attributed to nano IrO2 particles.

In situ generated metal oxyhydroxides on the surface of TMPs serve as real active sites. However, the reconstruction of most of the reported TMPs is incomplete and the active components cannot be fully used. Herein, hollow nanostructured Ni5P2/FeP4 nanoboxes (NiFeP NBs) are designed and synthesized as pre-catalysts. During the OER, the NiFeP NBs deeply reconstruct into low-crystalline and ultrathin NiOOH/FeOOH nanosheet assembled nanoboxes (NiOOH/FeOOH NBs). In situ Raman spectroscopy and ex situ characterization studies provide evidence that the hollow nanostructure facilitates the deep reconstruction of NiFeP NBs. Benefiting from the hierarchical hollow structure, the abundant interface between NiOOH and FeOOH, and plentiful defects, the reconstructed NiOOH/FeOOH NBs exhibit superior OER activity and excellent stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the Fe-Ni dual sites in the NiOOH/FeOOH interface may be the possible active sites.									49	1	0	0	3	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000664234200001

Among those, the development of boron-based advanced catalysts is subject to designing the active and durable compounds, working as bifunctional materials under alkaline medium. In this study, a series of ZrB2-based catalysts with a general formula of Zr(1-x)TMxB2 (x = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) (TM = Fe, Co, and Ni) were prepared through a straightforward route and employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The electrochemical measurements confirmed that the incorporation of Ni into the crystal structure of ZrB2 in the Zr0.8Ni0.2B2 sample led to an onset potential of 1.58 V in OER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), indicating a remarkable performance with a very low overpotential of 350 mV. Besides, Zr0.8Ni0.2B2 displayed an infinitesimal value of 56.6 mV dec(-1) regarding the Tafel slope, which was lesser as compared to the commercial RuO2 (66.2 mV dec(-1)). For the case of HER, Zr0.8Co0.2B2 showed the best performance compared to other samples with an overpotential of 420 mV and a Tafel slope of 101.6 mV dec(-1), following the Volmer mechanism. Both catalysts were examined for their long-term stability, manifesting excellent catalytic durability even after 12 h. Surprisingly, Zr0.8Co0.2B2 exhibited a drop from 420 to 380 mV in the overpotential value after 1000 CV sweeps, providing a promising performance in terms of HER. As-prepared metal-substituted ZrB2 electrocatalysts have great potential to be implemented in various green energy system applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, the interplay between invasive single Pt atom and native O-v in SA-Pt/rutile TiO2(110) surface, as well as their synergetic effect on water dissociation are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We show that importing Pt atom as Pt-ads, Pt-2c, Pt-5c and Pt-6c modes could decelerate the O-v migration effectively, especially in Pt-6c mode. Under oxygen-rich conditions, Pt-6c substitution could make oxygen O-v formation easier, but migration harder. On Pt-6c/Ti1-yO2-x1(110) surface, as a bimetal center, Pt-4c-Ti-5c concave could not make water dissociation process easier; however, the O-2c closed to Pt become a good proton acceptor to make water dissociation on Ti-5c-O-2c more convenient with the aid of topmost Ti-5c.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000664423800002

In this study, a noblemetal free OER electrocatalyst consisting of Mo-doped Ni3S2 nanocluster arrays on Nickle foam (Mo-Ni3S2/NF).fabricated using a modified one-step solvothermal approach.is developed and evaluated. The proposed electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional OER activity, requiring overpotentials of only 212 and 291 mV to deliver OER current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in alkaline seawater. The presence of Mo promotes Ni-S coordination, resulting in strong electronic interactions and substantially enhanced OER kinetics. Meanwhile, surface sulfate ions and (oxy)hydroxide (NiOOH) generated during the OER lead to enhanced activity and corrosion resistance, enabling Mo-Ni3S2/NF to operate continuously at 100 mA cm(-2) for 500 h in alkaline natural seawater. This study is expected to inform the progression of sulfur-based transition-metal electrocatalysts for seawater oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000797928000050

Herein, it is demonstrated that the surface decoration of a nickel foam (NF) with porous Ni/Ni3S2 microsheets yields an electrode with high electrical conductivity and an abundance of accessible Ni-0-Ni3S2 interfaces as active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 1m potassium hydroxide, Ni-Ni3S2/NF exhibits outstanding HER activity (an overpotential of 57mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2)) and similarly impressive OER activity (a low overpotential of only 295mV at a current density of 20mAcm(-2)). A water electrolyzer constructed using Ni-Ni3S2/NF as the HER and OER electrodes exhibits a low cell voltage of only 1.57V with no obvious performance loss over 30h, outperforming devices based on expensive Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. To the best of the author's knowledge, Ni-Ni3S2/NF is one of the best non-precious metal electrocatalysts reported to date for overall water splitting.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			2699-9412			WOS:000783863100008

Designing high performance Al/CuO-based initiator devices definitively requires reliable prediction of their ignition and reaction kinetics including self-heating or ageing as a function of heating rate and environmental conditions. The paper proposes a heterogeneous reaction model integrating an ensemble of basic mechanisms (oxygen diffusion, structural transformations, polymorphic phase changes) that have been collected from recent experimental investigations. The reaction model assumes that the rate of reaction is limited by the transport of oxygen across the growing layer of Al2O3 separating Al and CuO. Importantly, we show that the model predicts reasonably all exotherms through a wide range of temperature (ambient - 1000 degrees C), all resulting from a pure diffusion process as experimentally observed for such Al/CuO multilayers. The model shows how the temperature ramp affects the structure of the multilayer and especially the growth of alumina-based interfacial regions. It highlights the importance of the interfacial chemistry evolution such as the native mixture of AlxCuyOz transformation into a thin amorphous alumina, and the polymorphic phase transformation of this latter. The first one occurring at similar to 350 degrees C results in a loss of continuity of the interface leading to the accelerated redox reaction whereas the second one occurring between 500 and 600 degrees C produces a denser barrier to oxygen diffusion leading to the stop of redox reaction. We finally use the model to simulate thermal annealing as usually performed in accelerated ageing experiments. We theoretically observe and experimentally validate that a two weeks exposure of the multilayers at 200 degrees C starts degrading the multilayers thermal properties whereas when the temperature remains below 200 degrees C, the material keeps its entire integrity.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1364-7830	1741-3559		WOS:000476934500006

Porous organic polymers (POPs) have recently emerged as a versatile platform for the development of conventional heterogeneous catalysts, but their role in developing electrocatalysts for water splitting is underexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of an azo-functionalized POP (NDI-PG) in aqueous solution, under mild conditions, via the diazo coupling of redox active naphthalene diimide (NDI) based diamine with phloroglucinol. The azo nitrogen from the NDI diamine and one of the adjacent phenolic oxygen atoms in the POP are utilized to coordinate Co-II (Co-II-NDI-PG) and the resulting complex can be exploited as an OER electrocatalyst. Co-II-NDI-PG with a metal loading as low as 8% exhibited the best electrocatalytic activity toward water oxidation in alkaline solution with an overpotential of 340 mV. Additionally, the catalyst showed an improvement in the reaction kinetics with a low Tafel slope of 68 mV per decade. This report also compares the electrocatalytic activity of a Co-II coordinated POP containing benzidine (Co-II-BD-PG) in place of NDI diamine. NDI, being a redox active planar moiety unlike benzidine, exhibits better -electron delocalization facilitating an uninterrupted charge transfer which is beneficial for electrocatalysis.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448413100058

Herein, we prepared molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-decorated hollow nanoframes of a Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (Etched-PBA-MoS2) by mild chemical etching of the Co-Fe Prussian blue analog (PBA) nanocubes, followed by MoS2 decoration. We propose using an ethanol-water mixture as a mild etchant, eliminating the need for a capping or stabilizing agent. Prominently benefiting from the enhanced active surface area and the synergistic effect of multi-components, the as-prepared Etched-PBA-MoS2 nanoframes deposited on a microporous carbon cloth could deliver an excellent OER activity with an overpotential of only 260 mV to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in 1.0 M KOH.

Herein, nanocoral-like cerium-activated cobalt selenide (Ce-CoSe2) nanocomposites to enhance the OER catalytic activity have been successfully prepared by one-pot hydrothermal route via simply altering the cerium content. Owing to the ingenious introduction of cerium, as-prepared Ce-CoSe2 electrode displays remarkable OER performance in comparison with CoSe2. The nanocoral-like Ce-CoSe2 catalyst prepared under optimal condition just needs low overpotential of 276 and 398 mV at 10 and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. Additionally, it attains the current density of 255 mA cm(-2) at the potential of 2.0 V vs. RHE, and shows long-term stability during OER.

The complexing ability of glycine with a transition metal was exploited to form [Co(gly)(3)](-) dispersion at pH 10, which was used for the electrodeposition. High-resolution TEM, UV/Vis-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to confirm that the as-synthesized materials had an alpha-Co(OH)(2) phase. The electrocatalytic oxygen and hydrogen evolution activity of the glycine-coordinated alpha-Co(OH)(2) was found to be approximately 320 and 145 mV, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2). The material required approximately 1.60 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode; RHE) to achieve the benchmark of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting with a mass activity of approximately 63.7 A g(-1) at 1.60 V (vs. RHE). The chronoamperometric response was measured to evidence the stability of the material for overall water splitting for up to 24 h.

Herein, we fabricate an efficient MoS2-based catalyst (O-MoS2) with oxygen substituting a little part of sulfur in MoS2. Because the introduced O heteroatoms have the stronger electronegativity than S, the inert basal surface is activated, providing numerous active sites, improving the electrical transmission efficiency, and inducing the transition from the 2H to 1T phase of MoS2. The overpotential of as-fabricated O-MoS2 at 10 mA/cm(2) is only 120 mV in alkaline electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that introducing O heteroatoms into MoS2 optimizes the adsorption of H* and decreases the Gibbs free energies of the water dissociation, thus improving the HER performance significantly.

Electrochemical water splitting has shown attractive potential with regard to hydrogen production, and countless efforts have been devoted to developing advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting in recent years. Specifically, the development of robust electrocatalysts for the water oxidation reaction, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is more challenging due to the four-electron transfer process and high working potentials in corrosive environments. Recently, a variety of heterostructured electrocatalysts have exhibited intriguing performance toward water oxidation due to their unique structural merits including the confinement effect, electronic interaction, strain effect, interfacial bonding effect, and synergistic effect. In this review, the recent advances in heterostructured electrocatalysts for the OER are highlighted, and the underlying theories are summarized. Notably, we place a strong focus on heterostructures as a whole rather than reviewing individual building blocks separately, aiming to emphasize the superiorities of heterostructured electrocatalysts and discuss the relevant structure-function relationship. Also, the general design principles for constructing efficient heterostructured electrocatalysts toward water oxidation are summarized. This review provides new insights into understanding the interface chemistry in heterostructured OER electrocatalysts, and will provide a variety of new possibilities for the design and development of advanced OER electrocatalysts and beyond.									36	3	0	0	3	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200001

Here, a metal-free tyramine functionalized graphene oxide (T-GO) electrocatalyst is proposed to use in alkaline electrolytes for enhanced OER. Moreover, the T-GO and GO nanomaterials are well characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. T-GO exhibits an electrocatalytic OER with a current density of 2 mA cm(-2) at a low onset potential of approximate to 1.39 V and a small Tafel slope of about 69 mV dec(-1) and GO exhibits an onset potential of 1.51 V and Tafel slope of about 92 mV dec(-1). Additionally, the current stability and RRDE based diffusion controlled response of the T-GO electrocatalyst are outstanding compared to GO. This study establishes metal free T-GO as an efficient electrocatalyst for the OER and used for cathodic production of hydrogen as a counter reaction in the field of water splitting.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			2046-2069			WOS:000461567800004	35518457

In all of these processes, heme oxygenase has evolved a similar structural and mechanistic scaffold to function within seemingly diverse physiological pathways. The heme oxygenase reaction is catalytically distinct from that of other hemoproteins such as the cytochromes P450, peroxidases, and catalases, but shares a hemoprotein scaffold that has evolved to generate a distinct activated oxygen species. In the following review we discuss the evolution of the structural and functional properties of heme oxygenase in light of the recent crystal structures of the mammalian and bacterial enzymes.									152	2	0	0	128	0	155			1523-0864	1557-7716		WOS:000177727700007	12230872

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-functionalized few-layer black phosphorus nanosheets (PVP-BP) are used as the matrix. With the help of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interaction, Co, N-codoped porous carbon (PC) with different morphologies can be straightforwardly grown on the surface of PVP-BP. By adding cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), PC presents cubic morphology, otherwise, it shows dodecahedron morphology. Both samples, PVP-BP-PC-1 and PVP-BP-PC-2, possess high BET specific surface areas (SSAs) of 1466.7629 m(2) g(-1) and 1344.6098 m(2) g(-1), and exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities. At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), PVP-BP-PC-1 and PVP-BP-PC-2 require the overpotentials of 190 mV and 238.2 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively, while 433 mV and 430.8 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively.

Despite tremendous efforts, large-scale fabrication of highly-active and durable oxide electrocatalytic electrodes remains as a great challenge. Herein, we report a fast and general strategy for manufacturing a series of hierarchical nanostructured metal oxides (MOx, M= Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ag, Sn, W and NiFe) as electrocatalysts by laser ablation on corresponding metal substrates. Particularly, the NiO nanocrystal electrocatalysts (similar to 3 nm) grown on Ni plates have been directly employed as highly active and stable bifunctional electrodes for both hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions, by taking advantage of its large surface area, rich defects, high hydrophilicity and aerophobicity. The facile laser treatments to construct nanoporous electrodes should facilitate the development of low-cost and high-performance electrocatalytic overall water splitting with large-scale.									79	8	0	0	1	0	81			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000400647900024

Despite promising research progress in the preparation of various non-noble metal based electrocatalysts, it is still highly challenging but desirable to develop novel fabrication strategies to synthesize highly active and cost-effective ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysts in a precisely controlled manner. Herein, we report atomic layer deposition (ALD) of highly monodisperse Co3O4 nanocrystals of different sizes on N-doped electrospun carbon nanofibers (nCNFs) as high performance bifunctional catalysts (Co@nCNFs) for the ORR and OER. Co@nCNFs (with an average Co3O4 particle size of similar to 3 nm) show high ORR performance exhibiting an onset potential of 0.87 V with a low Tafel slope of 119 mV dec (1) approaching that of commercial Pt/C. Similarly, the Co@nCNF electrocatalyst showed remarkable catalytic activity in the OER. The turnover frequency (TOF) value determined at an overpotential of 550 mV for the Co@nCNFs is similar to 0.14 s(-1) which is ca. 3 and ca. 15-fold higher than those of bulk Co (similar to 0.05 s(-1)) and the standard state-of-the-art IrOx (0.0089 s(-1)) catalyst, respectively. This work will open new possibilities for fabrication of inexpensive non-noble metal materials in highly controlled manner for applications as bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysis.									16	3	0	0	0	0	16			2516-0230			WOS:000480635100037	36133191

Thus, the development of efficient electrocatalysts with high activity and durability is of great technological and scientific significance. We demonstrate here for the first time that pristine carbon nanotubes (CNTs) composed of between 2 and 7 concentric tubes and an outer diameter of 2-5 nm have an outstanding activity for the OER in alkaline solution as compared with single-walled and multi-walled CNTs (SWNTs & MWNTs). For example, current density measured at 1.8V (vs RHE) for the OER on triple-walled CNTs is 56 mA cm(-2), similar to 10 times higher than 5.9 mA cm(-2) measured on SWNTs and 35 times higher than 1.6 mA cm(-2) measured on MWNTs. The activity of such CNTs is significantly higher than that of conventional 20% Ru/C and 50% Pt/C electrocatalysts at high polarization potentials. Such CNTs also show an excellent stability toward OER. One hypothesis is that for the OER on CNTs with specific number of walls, efficient electron transfer occurs on the inner tubes of the CNTs most likely through electron tunneling between outer wall and inner tubes, significantly promoting the charge transfer reaction of OER at the surface of outer wall of the CNTs. For SWNTs, such separation of functionality for OER is not possible, while effective electron tunneling between outer wall and inner tubes of the CNTs diminishes as the number of walls increases due to the reduced dc bias (i.e., the driving force) across the walls or layers of MWNTs. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the observed distinctive volcano-type dependence of the electrocatalytic activity and turnover frequencies (TOF) of CNTs as a function of number of walls.

Here, in combination of composition, structure, and catalytic mechanism analysis, the porous Co0.7Fe0.3P@C catalyst was synthesized by a facile phosphidation process of Co0.7Fe0.3@C which is derived from the corresponding Co-Fe coordination polymer precursors. The Co0.7Fe0.3P@C catalyst shows enhanced electrochemical activity toward oxygen evolution reaction and water splitting due to the incorporation of Fe element and the porous structure, comparable to the commercial noble metal catalyst. Furthermore, the coated carbon can not only promote electronic transmission but also protect the active Co0.7Fe0.3P nanoparticles, resulting in good activity and stability. These fascinating findings in this work would promote the designation and preparation of promising bimetallic oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst utilizing coordination polymers as precursors for various energy systems in the future.									16	2	0	0	2	0	16			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000434894100016

The manganese and manganese oxide cluster anions are studied in a pulsed supersonic molecular beam experiment and generated in a conventional laser vaporization cluster source with an additional flow tube reactor. Relative reactivities are determined at near room temperature as a function of oxygen partial pressure, cluster size, and composition. We observed for the first time the controlled formation of at least four stable manganese oxide series: Mn(x)O(-), Mn(x)O(2)(-), Mn(x)O(3)(-), and Mn(x)O(4)(-) (x = 2-12). The reactivities decrease rapidly with cluster size reaching a minimum around Mn, and Mn;. They increase smoothly with further increasing cluster size and show no significant pressure dependence for clusters of x > 5. The adsorption of molecular oxygen on the cluster surface most probably takes place in a dissociative way resulting in the formation of distinct Mn-O bonds. The Mn(5)(-) cluster exhibits a special behavior. It has the highest intensity in mass spectra and shows the lowest reactivity towards oxygen. Another interesting feature is the evolution of an intense Mn(2)O(-) peak with increasing oxygen pressure, (Int J Mass Spectrom 185/186/187 (1999) 673-683) (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1387-3806			WOS:000079857900062

The effects of amorphous nature and surface chemical environment on the functionalities of metal oxide are systematically investigated with well-crystalline and amorphous MnO2 nanocrystals with/without surface anchoring of highly oxidized iodate clusters. The amorphous MnO2 nanocrystal containing anchored iodate clusters shows much better performance as an oxygen evolution electrocatalyst and cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries than both iodate-free amorphous and well-crystalline homologues, underscoring the remarkable advantage of simultaneous enhancement of structural disorder and surface electron density. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopic analysis demonstrates the promoted formation of double (Mn(sic)O) bond, a critical step of oxygen evolution reaction, upon amorphization caused by the poor orbital overlap inside highly disordered crystallites. The beneficial effects of iodate anchoring and amorphization on electrocatalyst functionality are attributable to the alteration of surface bonding character, stabilization of Jahn-Teller active Mn3+ species, and enhanced charge transfer of interfaces. The present study underscores that fine-tuning of structural disorder and surface bonding nature provides an effective methodology to explore efficient metal oxide-based electrocatalysts.									24	1	0	0	1	0	23			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000485816900001	31490620

In this work, we report a newly designed mixed-node MOF catalyst, CoxFe1-x-MOF-74 (0 < x <= 1), which acts as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution with remarkably low overpotential (280 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)), small Tafel slope (56 mV/dec), and high faradic efficiency (91%) and can deliver a current density of 20 mA/cm(2) at 1.58 V for overall water splitting. Moreover, using the combination of multiple spectroscopic methods, including X-ray absorption, electron spin resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc., we unraveled the mechanistic origin of the enhanced catalytic performance of CoxFe1-x-MOF-74 compared to its single-metal counterparts. We show the mixed-node MOF can provide more open metal sites and an enhanced electron-rich environment, which facilitates efficient charge transfer and results in significantly enhanced OER activity.									170	13	0	0	8	0	170			2380-8195			WOS:000447581500032

However, to enable Li-O-2 batteries for practical applications, numerous challenges need to be overcome, e. g. high overpotential, low rate capability, and poor cycling stability. The key factor to tackle these issues is to develop highly-efficient cathode catalysts. Moreover, cathode catalysts with a porous structure and large surface area are favorable in Li-O-2 batteries. In this paper, hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanoboxes with well-defined interior voids, functional shells and a large surface area have been facilely synthesized via an ion exchange reaction between Prussian blue analogue nanocubic precursors and OH at a low temperature (60 degrees C). The obtained products possess hierarchical pore sizes and an extremely large surface area (272.5 m(2) g(-1)), which provide more catalytically active sites to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a Li-O-2 battery cathode, as well as facilitating the diffusion of oxygen and the electrolyte. The hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanobox cathode shows enhanced discharge capacity, reduced overpotential, improved rate performance and cycle stability, in comparison with the EC-300J carbon cathode. The superb performance of the hierarchical porous Co3O4 nanoboxes, together with the facile fabrication approach, presents an alternative method to develop advanced cathode catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.									59	4	0	0	3	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374862600015

Developing efficient, robust, and green catalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is of great interest. This study concerns a facile and green approach for producing RuNi/RuNi oxide nanoheterostructures by controllable partial oxidation of RuNi nanoalloy, which is characterized and confirmed by various techniques, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This nanoheterostructure demonstrates outstanding bifunctional activities for catalyzing the HER and OER with overpotentials that are both among the lowest reported values. In a practical alkali-water-splitting electrolyzer, it also achieves a record-low cell voltage of 1.42 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which is significantly superior to the commercial RuO2//Pt/C couple and other reported bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations are employed to elaborate the effect of Ni incorporation. This simple catalyst preparation approach is expected to be transferrable to other electrocatalytic reactions.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000535041700028	32187860

As an alternative, the use of green hydrogen produced by electrocatalysis constitutes a nice strategy as its products and reactants are not toxic to the environment. However, the use of scarce materials and high overpotentials to accomplish the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) make electrocatalysis an uncompetitive process. To solve these challenges, a low-cost procedure for the preparation of earth-abundant Ni, Fe and NiFe decorated electrodes has been developed. For this purpose, pencil graphite rods have been selected as highly porous substrates. A reasonable performance is achieved when they are employed for the OER. Furthermore, for the first time, a detailed analysis of impedance spectroscopy allows the association of the Ni redox transitions Ni2+/Ni3+ and Ni3+/Ni4+ (including the identification of the hydrated alpha-gamma and the non-hydrated beta phases) with an electrochemical redox capacitance response. Additionally, the Ni3+/Ni4+ redox peak capacitance together with a quick decrease in the charge transfer resistance indicates the implication of Ni4+ in the OER.

Electroreforming of organic substances coupling with electrochemical hydrogen evolution is an innovative strategy to achieve energy-saving co-generation of value-added chemicals and hydrogen. Herein, NiIr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheet arrays are in situ grown on Ni foam (NiIr-MOF/NF) and employed as a bifunctional self-supported electrocatalyst to oxidize small organic molecules of methanol to the value-added chemical formate while efficiently facilitating hydrogen production. The constructed co-electrolytic system based on HER-methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) bifunctional NiIr-MOF/NF electrocatalyst possesses ultra-high energy conversion efficiency for electrochemically assisted overall water splitting, with a low cell voltage of only 1.39 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Especially, the Faradaic efficiencies of the cathode and anode could both reach nearly 100% for H-2 and formate generated in 1 M KOH containing 4 M methanol.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000707857800001

Herein, the synthesis of novel FeNiP solid-solution nanoplate (FeNiP-NP) arrays and their use as an active catalyst for high-performance water-oxidation catalysis are reported. The as-prepared FeNiP-NP catalyst on a 3D nickel foam substrate exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a very low overpotential of only 180 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an onset overpotential of 120 mV in 1.0 m KOH for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The slope of the Tafel plot is as low as 76.0 mV dec(-1). Furthermore, the long-term electrochemical stability of the FeNiP-NP electrode is investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) at 1.10-1.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), demonstrating very stable performance with negligible loss in activity after 1000 CV cycles. This present FeNiP-NP solid solution is thought to represent the best OER catalytic activity among the non-noble metal catalysts reported so far.									127	8	0	0	8	0	127			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000417490700020	29058346

A UiO-66(Zr) MOF design was selected for this study that incorporates three linker designs, a 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (BDC), BDC functionalized with an amino group (BDC-NH2), and BDC functionalized with nitro group (BDC-NO2). The study found several key differences between homogeneous planar catalyst thermodynamics and MOF-based thermodynamics, the most significant being the non-unique or heterogeneity of reaction sites. Additionally, the functionalization of the MOF was found to significantly influence the hydroperoxyl binding energy, which proves to be the largest hurdle for both oxide and MOF-based catalyst. Both of these findings provide evidence that many of the limitations precluding planar homogeneous catalysts can be surpassed with a MOF-based catalyst. The BDC-NH2 proved to be the best performing catalyst with a predicted over-potential for spontaneous OER evolution to be 3.03eV.

The synergistic effect between PANI coating and underlying porous FeP not only affords richly exposed active sites, but also modulates the electronic structure of FeP and thus accelerates the charge or mass transfer efficiency, which eventually improves the catalytic activity. The self-supported PANI/p-FeP/NCF/CP composite requires low overpotentials of 59 and 76 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) current density in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Otherwise, PANI/p-FeP/NCF/CP only requires an overpotential of 355 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )in 1.0 M KOH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). PANI/p-FeP/NCF/CP exhibits good durability for HER and OER due to the protective effect of PANI coating in the electrochemical process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000838336600004

The improvement of specific activity of Pt is typically achieved by introducing the transition metal to obtain the alloy structure. Different from the traditional alloy structure, herein, we report Pt catalyst modified with Co single atoms obtained by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The as-prepared catalysts show much higher mass activity and excellent stability compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The atomic resolution TEM images and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) indicate the formation of atomically dispersed Co on Pt. First principle calculations reveal that the Co atom affects the electronic structure of the Pt catalysts, which resulted in the high HER and ORR performance. This work provides a new approach for the rational design of highly active and stable Pt-based catalysts, which hold great potential for application in various catalytic reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000744083100003

To replace noble-metal based catalysts and boost catalytic performance of carbon-based materials, we initially develop the nickel, phosphorus, sulfur and nitrogen co-modified mesoporous carbon (NiPS3@NMC) as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. The performance for ORR (half-wave potential at 0.90 V) and OER (10 mA cm(-2) at 1.48 V) surpasses those of Pt/C coupled with IrO2 catalysts and most of the non-precious metal based bifunctional electrocatalysts reported in related literature. Moreover, the electrochemical durability is also confirmed by accelerated durability tests (ADTs) and long-term chronoamperometry (CA) tests. We demonstrated that the interfacial effect between NiPS3 quantum sheets (QSs) and NMC substrates by thermal activation contributed to the enhanced oxygen electrode bifunctionality with more active sites, due to the electrons-donating from nickel, phosphorus and sulfur elements and relatively enriched pyridinic type N. Such excellent overall performance highlights the potential application of NiPS3 QSs and NMC composites as the materials on energy conversion and storage.

At the RCs, the key steps of transformation of solar radiation into electrochemical free energy take place. Two types of RCs exist which differ in the nature of their electron acceptor for 'stable' light induced charge separation: iron-sulphur cluster in type I and quinone in type II. The type II of oxygenic photosynthesis is unique since it has the added machinery for oxygen evolution.									39	0	0	0	20	0	39			0011-3891			WOS:000278319800015

Herein, a selenide hybrid consisting of Co3Se4 and FeSe2 was prepared successfully by a facile one-step hydrothermal method using CoFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets as the precursor. Electrochemical tests on the rotating disk electrode demonstrate that the hybrid possesses good performance for the OER during water splitting. The Co3Se4&FeSe2 catalyst can achieve an overpotential as low as 280 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (close to RuO2) with a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). Such OER activity is also better than those of the majority of the as-reported metal selenide catalysts. It could be attributed to the high electrocatalytic activity of Co3Se4 and the synergistic effect between the two metal selenides, which reduce the reaction energy barrier effectively. Long term stability tests show that the sample can last for 24 hours without significant attenuation. Therefore, this work not only provides a facile synthesis method for metal selenides from LDH precursors, but also supplies an efficient hybrid electrocatalyst as a promising candidate for water oxidation.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2052-1553			WOS:000475394700019

In this study, a simple and scalable strategy is proposed to fabricate 3 D heteronanorods on nickel foam, in which nickel molybdenum phosphide nanorods are covered with cobalt iron phosphide (P-NM-CF HNRs). As a result of the rational design, the P-NM-CF HNRs have a large surface area, tightly connected interfaces, optimized electronic structures, and synergy between the metal atoms. Accordingly, the P-NM-CF HNRs exhibit a remarkably high catalytic activity for the OER under alkaline conditions and wide-pH HER. For overall water splitting, the catalyst only requires a voltage of 1.53 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH with prominent stability, and the activity is not degraded after stability testing for 36 h. This new strategy can inspire the design of durable nonprecious-metal catalysts for large-scale industrial water splitting.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000538859000001	32363782

The results indicate that an increase in pressure increased the NO2 formation, while NO and N2O decreased. The partial pressure of oxygen had a weak effect on NO formation. These results must be interpreted in accordance with the fact that the gases collected represent more closely the desorption step of oxidized-nitrogen-char reactions than those obtained in situations where homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions of nitrogen species are difficult to separate.

In this article, mesoporous cobalt molybdenum nitride (Co3Mo3N) is prepared using a coprecipitation method followed by ammonia annealing treatment. Much more active sites generated by well designed mesoporous nanostructure and intrinsically electronic configuration lead to excellent electrocatalytic performance for ORR/OER in Li-O-2 cells, delivering considerable specific capacity and alleviating polarization. It is manifested that high charge-discharge efficiency and good cycle stability were obtained in the LiTFSI/TEGDME electrolyte owing to a stable interface between optimized electrolyte and electrode material.									123	13	0	0	3	0	127			1932-7447			WOS:000313932800013

According to first-principles thermodynamics calculation, we predict B-doped graphene can be a potential catalyst to improve the charge rate of lithium-air battery. The lowest-energy reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is predicted as Li+ -> Li+ -> O-2. The rate-determining step (RDS) is predicted as the O-2 evolution step. B doped graphene can reduce the RDS barrier by 0.40 eV, indicating that charge rate may be significantly improved. B-doping can increase charge transferring of Li2O2 to the substrate by 0.36 e(-), which helps to active Li-O bonds and oxidize O-2(2-) to O-2. We suggest a good OER catalytic substrate that can reduce the O-2 evolution barrier should show p-type surface behavior.									70	6	0	0	1	0	71			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000342652000002

Herein, Ni5P4 is proposed as a cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution and hydrazine oxidation in a reformed electrolyzer. Experiments indicate that the electrolytic overpotential could be significantly reduced by replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the hydrazine oxidation reaction at the anode. Furthermore, a scenario for hydrogen production is demonstrated by utilizing a stable and low-cost perovskite solar cell (PSC) with a carbon back electrode to drive a reformed electrolyzer. Importantly, a single PSC can drive three reformed electrolyzers in series for hydrogen production by carefully matching the operating point of the electrolyzer with the maximum power point of the photovoltaic device, thereby, yielding a H-2 evolution rate of 1.77 mg h(-1) for the whole PV-EC system. This can be a potential starting point for hydrogen production using a single PSC-driven electrolysis system.									7	2	0	0	0	0	7			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000459737500010	30520261

The electrocatalyst is a key component for operating URFC unit cell devices. Optimal electrocatalyst materials should be bi-functional with catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Over the past few decades, platinum has been recognized as a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst material for the URFC system. However, the ORR and OER activity of Pt is inadequate during the round-trip energy conversion process due to the formation of an oxide layer (PtOx) and the high onset potential for H-2 evolution. To address these issues, extensive effort has been made to enhance the OER performance without affecting the ORR performance. The most efficient alternative electrocatalyst materials comprise combinations of platinum group metals (PGMs) and their oxides, especially Pt-Ir, Pt-Ir-Ru, Pt-IrO2, Pt-Ir-IrO2, and Pt-IrO2-RuO2. This comprehensive review emphasizes the potential of various bifunctional electrocatalyst materials for renewable energy generation in the URFC system. Herein, we discuss the limitations of Pt electrocatalysts in the URFC-OER process based on the reaction mechanism. The classification of different bifunctional electrocatalysts is extensively reviewed and highlighted based on the structural, microstructural, fuel cell-ORR, and water electrolysis-OER characteristics, round-trip energy conversion efficiency, inadequacies, and advantages. Taking these features into account, we discuss the possibilities and performance of cost-effective bifunctional electrocatalyst materials for the ORR/OER electro-catalytic process in advanced URFC systems. This review presents an exclusive vision for the development of bifunctional electrocatalyst materials and should stimulate research on bifunctional electrode-based URFC systems.

As a result, the as-synthesized 3D self-supported Cu-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on carbon paper (Cu-CoP NAs/CP) exhibits admirable electrocatalytic performance toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotentials of 81 and 411 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M PBS (Phosphate Buffer Solution), respectively. Moreover, a neutral electrolyzer, using Cu-CoP NAs/CP as both the anode and cathode, achieves a low cell voltage of 1.72 Vat 10 mA cm(-2), superior to that of the typical Pt/C parallel to IrO2 couple (1.81 V) and of most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrocatalysts. Impressively, the electrolyzer can be driven by a single AA battery (similar to 1.5 V), indicating its practicality in neutral water or seawater splitting. Experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculations results reveal that the incorporation of Cu into CoP can effectively improve the conductivity and optimize the electronic structure to facilitate the H* adsorption and desorption and the formation of O* intermediates (generated CoOOH active species), thus yielding superior HER and OER catalytic activities. This study opens up a promising way to rationally design highly efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for electrocatalysis applications.									94	8	0	0	4	0	96			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000514218900004

Compared with industrial Pb -0. 3%Ag -0.06% Ca anodes, the overpotential of oxygen evolution of Pb -0. 3% Ag - 0.6% Sb -0. 06% Ca is 27 mV lower at 500 A/m2, and the electrode surface exchange current density is about two times higher in value than the ones for Pb -0. 3%Ag - 0. 06% Ca anodes. For Pb -0. 3% Ag -0. 06% Ca anode, Sb addition obviously improves the electrocatalytic activity, benefits oxygen evolution reaction as well as reduces cell voltage and power consumption.

Solid-state reaction was completed upon reactive flash sintering taking place at similar to 1002 degrees C under 200 V/cm. Hexagonal BaTiO3 phase, which rarely occurs at such temperatures, was obtained after flash sintering at a current density of 23.5 mA/mm(2). It is speculated that oxygen deficiency during flash sintering triggered cubic-to-hexagonal transition of BaTiO3. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction results show that solid-state reaction takes place prior to flash sintering. Electric field could accelerate the reaction but did not alter the sequence of phase evolution.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000676115500001

We report N-doped carbon nanofibers as the catalyst of an oxygen reduction reaction, which were synthesized via carbonizing bacterial cellulose-polypyrrole composites. The as-prepared material exhibited remarkable catalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction with comparable onset potential and the ability to limit the current density of commercial Pt/C catalysts in both alkaline and acid media due to the unique porous three-dimensional network structure and the doped nitrogen atoms. The effect of N functionalities on catalytic behavior was systematically investigated. The results demonstrated that pyridinic-N was the dominating factor for catalytic performance toward the oxygen reduction reaction. Additionally, N-doped carbon nanofibers also demonstrated excellent cycling stability (93.2% and 89.4% retention of current density after chronoamperometry 20 000 s in alkaline and media, respectively), obviously superior to Pt/C.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000412644300002	27869642

The metal wire-type "one-body" electrode prepared in the full-immersion reactor demonstrates the unique three-dimensional fractal structure with high branching degree and surface area. Moreover, the compositional turning of metal crystal via element doping is beneficial to improving the conductivity and crystal structure. The Ni and Zn elements are introduced to form Ni-Fe and Zn-Fe alloy dendrites, showing a preferable electrochemical catalytic oxygen evolution performance. The as-prepared Ni-Fe dendrite demonstrates a lower overpotential about 248 mV (vs RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) in the alkaline condition.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000512716600001

Herein, S modulated Ni3FeN supported on N/S co-doped graphene (S-Ni3FeN/NSG) is synthesized via controlling the nitriding process of NiFe disulfides. The beneficial effect of the design strategy and S decoration on electrocatalytic activity are determined and analysed systematacially. The S-Ni3FeN/NSG-700 delivers excellent bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis performance with half-wave potential of 0.878 V for ORR and low OER overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that S decoration effectively promotes the formation of OOH* intermediates and observably decreases the maximum of change of the Gibbs free energies for four primitive OER steps. Notably, when S-Ni3FeN/NSG700 as air electrode applied in Zn-air battery test, the device shows superb durability for 1200 discharge/charge cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). The corresponding all-solid Zinc-air battery exhibits excellent mechanical flexibility and a high power density of 140.1 mW cm(-2). Two Zinc-air batteries in series can long-term stably power a self-made water-splitting device. This work provides new insights into highly efficient and low-cost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst designing.									49	2	0	0	1	0	49			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000541147500008

Herein, we report hollow CoP nanosphere-embedded carbon nanotube/nitrogen-doped carbon (NC-CNT/CoP) nanoarrays, in which a nanoscale Kirkendall effect generates few-layer graphene-coated hollow CoP nanospheres with abundant active sites. The integrated NC-CNT/CoP electrode behaves as an efficient pH-universal HER catalyst and, through in situ transformation, the derived materials show excellent OER performance. The NC-CNT/CoP-based electrolyzers achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low voltages of 1.63, 1.69, and 1.66 V in KOH, PBS, and H2SO4, respectively, which are similar to the values obtained using noble metal catalysts. Importantly, the integrated electrode exhibits superior stability than that of the benchmark noble metals in a wide pH range.

As supercapacitor material, the CoMoO4@Ni(OH)(2) coreshell hollow nanotubes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 1246 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1), and 86.7% of the original capacitance was also retained at 5 A g(-1), indicating an excellent rate performance. Theoretical analysis showed that the surface capacitance dominated the total capacitance of the CoMoO4@Ni(OH)(2) electrode. The asymmetric supercapacitor device based on CoMoO4@Ni(OH)(2) and porous carbon exhibited high energy density of 62.5 Wh kg(-1). In addition, the overpotential of the as-prepared material was 0.35 V in the oxygen evolution reaction at the scan rate of 10 mV s(-1), showing high activity. All these electrochemical properties indicated that the fabricated hierarchical CoMoO4@Ni(OH)(2) core-shell nanotubes were promising candidates for highly performed bifunctional supercapacitors and oxygen electrocatalysts.

Theoretically, rechargeable flexible zin-cair (Zn-air) batteries could provide high specific energy, while their large-sCale applications are still greatly hindered by high cost and resources scarcity of noble metal -based oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts as well as inferior mechanical properties of the air cathode. Combining metallic Co4N with superior OER activity and Co-N-C with perfect ORR activity on a free-standing and flexible electrode could be a good step for flexible Zn-air batteries, while lots of difficulties need to be overcome. Herein, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we first propose a strategy for in situ coupling of strung Co4N and intertwined N-C fibers, by pyrolyzation of the novel pearl-like ZIF-67/polypytrole nanofibers netwcitk rooted on carbon cloth. Originating froth the synergistic effect of Co4N and co-N-C and the stable 3D interconnected conductive network structure, the obtained free-standing and highly flexible bifunctional, oxygen electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability for both OM and ORR in terms of low overpotential (310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) for OER, a positive half-wave potential (0.8 V) for ORR, and a stable current density retention for at least 20 h, and especially, the obtained Zn air batteries exhibit a low discharge charge voltage gap (1.09 V at 50 mA cm(-2)) and long cycle life (up to 408 cycles). Furthermore, the perfect bendable and twistable and rechargeable properties of the flexible Zn air battery particularly make it a. potentially power portable and wearable electronic device.									701	41	0	0	14	0	709			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000381715700030	27463122

In this work, we show a cell configuration, including a multiwalled carbon nanotube electrode and a low flammability glyme electrolyte, capable of hundreds of cycles without signs of decay. Nuclear magnetic resonance and electrochemical tests confirm the suitability of the electrolyte in a practical battery, whereas morphological and structural aspects revealed by electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction demonstrate the reversible formation and dissolution of lithium peroxide during the electrochemical process.

However, the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as the anodic reaction, typically consumes approximately 90% of the electricity input, necessitating the development of an efficient OER for energy-saving purposes. Herein, we developed a unique heterostructure of multi-double (bi)-shelled Co-based spheres via a facile template-free method, in which each bi-shelled structure is composed of Co9Se8/Co9S8/CoO (Co-S-Se) with a symmetric configuration. These heterogeneous nanospheres possess both sufficient heterointerfaces and a high density of active sites and exhibit excellent OER activity in alkaline media with a low overpotential of 226 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 46.5 mV dec(-1), and long-term durability over 15 h. As a proof and concept, when coupled with a cathodic CO2 reduction reaction, the electrochemical performance of Pd nanosheets (NSs) for CO2 reduction can be significantly enhanced in terms of product selectivity and energy input. Our study might provide insight into the development of efficient OER electrocatalysts for practical CO2 reduction reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1884-4049	1884-4057		WOS:000822353100001

Engineering the electronic structures and surface properties of electrocatalysts is a feasible approach to improve their catalytic performance. Introducing defects such as anion and cation vacancies into transition metal-based materials to enhance their activity for various energy-related electrocatalytic reactions has been receiving increasingly attention in recent years.

Herein, we fabricate a novel Ni3S2@Co(OH)(2) heterostructure with a tentative method combining hydrothermal method with electrodeposition, in which the Ni3S2 nanosheets are evenly integrated with Co(OH)(2) nanoparticles. Electrochemical tests reveal preeminent catalytic activities and durability on this heterostructure for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It presents high catalytic activities of 110 and 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, in 1.0 M KOH solution. Moreover this bifunctional electrode requires only 1.61 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent durability when assembled as an electrolyzer, superior than that of Pt-C parallel to IrO2. The promoted activities are benefited from the interfacial cooperation and synergistic effect between Ni3S2 and Co(OH)(2), because of which the charge-transfer ability is enhanced and surface reactivity is of furtherance. This work is of very profound significance on electrocatalysts for water splitting, specific performances: (1) This heterostructure is synthesized based on interface engineering. (2) The promoted performance is due to the synergistic effect of two onefold-components. (3) The catalysis activities for HER and OER can synchronously reach ideal states when it is used as bifunctional catalyst.									48	1	0	0	1	0	48			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000441872300017

Focused on the intersection of the three hotspots, solar-driven thermal & donor modulated electrolytic water splitting to hydrogen production plus wastewater treatment was constructed for efficient hydrogen production and effective wastewater treatment. The system was facilitated by an action of a solar highly thermal coupling and donor-alternative to the redox chemistry. For a motivation of totally elucidating the solar thermo-assisted and organic donor-alternated water splitting system, the redox model and thermodynamic calculation were first conducted in this paper, based on the combination of the electrochemical and thermodynamic equations of the hydrogen production complex. The redox models fully demonstrate that the prevailing and dominant reactions occur in the alternative of the complex organic donors, fed in soluble small organic molecules in wastewater such as small organic alcohol, aldehyde, and acid. The results novelly showed that the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode was found to be replaced by the alternative of the easily electron-donated molecules to dominate the anodic reaction of the organics to carbon dioxide. The calculated thermo-dependent potentials reveal that the thermo-assisted action results in a negative temperature coefficient to the cell potential. The thermodynamic calculation theoretically proves that the electrolytic potential is sharply reduced by a switch of the anodic reaction and thermo-assisted effect. Therefore, both thermal assistance and organic donor alternation give fall to the cell potential (from 1.229 V to 0.4-0.6 V) and switch from the oxygen evolution reaction to the anodic oxidation of organic molecules. The operated cell potentials are predicted reasonably more than the applied voltage required for the endothermic water-splitting redox, nearly no H-2 evolution in such a range of the applied bias. The data can be applied for the organic donor choice and temperature modulation for the promotion of the hydrogen production. The data could offer theoretical support for solar-enabled hydrogen production and water treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000603332600008

By taking inspiration from the catalytic properties of transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), we herein propose a general MOF-intermediated synthesis of a series of hollow CoFeM (M = Bi, Ni, Mn, Cu, Ce, and Zn) trimetallic phosphides composed of ultrathin nanosheets as advanced electrocatalysts for the OER. A dramatic improvement of electrocatalytic performance toward the OER is observed for hollow CoFeM trimetallic phosphides compared to bimetallic CoFe phosphides. Remarkably, composition-optimized CoFeBiP hollow microspheres could deliver superior electrocatalytic performance, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of only 273 mV. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the Bi and P doping effectively optimizes the electronic structure of Co and Fe by charge redistribution, which significantly lowers the adsorption energy of oxygen intermediates. Moreover, the hollow microsphere structures composed of ultrathin nanosheets also enable them to provide rich surface active sites to boost the electrocatalytic OER.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000639143600001	33889888

However, most of their performances are still inferior to state-of-the-art precious metals especially for Ru and Ir. Herein, we apply a continuous ion exchange method and further hydrothermal treatment to synthesize the flake-like Ag-CoSO4 nanohybrids beginning from Co-BTC (BTC: benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid) metal-organic frameworks precursor. The catalyst exhibits superior OER performance under the alkaline electrolyte solution (a low overpotential of 282 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 mol/L KOH), which is even better than RuO2 due to the improved conductivity and rapid electrons transfer process via introducing small amount of Ag. The existence of Ag in the hybrids is beneficial for increasing the Co(IV) concentration, thus promoting the *OOH intermediate formation process. Besides, due to the very low requirement of Ag content (lower than 1 atom%), the cost of the catalyst is also limited. This work provides a new insight for designing of inexpensive OER catalysts with high performance and low cost.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1674-0068	2327-2244		WOS:000512882000014

Nanoscale integration of these two materials is challenging. A new synthesis route is developed that integrates 2D MOF nanocrystals and graphitic carbon nanolamellae into layered composites. The graphitic carrier contributes excellent charge-transport properties, and the 2D macromolecular MOF precursor provides a suitable shuttle for introducing highly dispersed metal species. Furthermore their direct chemical environment can be controlled via selection of organic linker. Thermal decomposition of 2D cobalt tetrafluoro benzene-dicarboxylate MOF nanocrystals within such composites enables the stabilization of cobalt oxyhydroxyfluoride nanoparticles on the graphitic carrier, which display an extraordinary activity for the OER in alkaline media, with low onset overpotential (310 mV(RHE)) and current densities >10(4) mA cm(-2) mu mol(Co)(-1) at an operating overpotential of 450 mV, alongside excellent operational stability. The wide compositional array of MOFs makes this synthesis approach versatile toward advanced (electro)catalysts and other functional materials for applications from sensing to energy storage and conversion.									33	3	0	0	1	0	34			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000453273200003

Herein, hydrothermal and annealing processes are employed to prepare FeCo alloy nanoparticles in Ndoped carbon shells on a defect-rich carbon support (FeCoNC/D). The introduction of defect-rich carbon support combined with the strong coupling of distributed FeCo alloy and N-doped carbon shell efficiently enhances the electrocatalytic activity. The FeCoNC/D exhibits superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 892 mV (vs. RHE) for the ORR and an overpotential of 362 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for the OER. Moreover, Zn-air secondary battery prepared with FeCoNC/D displays a higher specific capacity of 725 mA h gZn -1, a power density of 157 mW cm-2 at 245 mA cm-2, and long-term cycling stability compared to state-of-the-art Pt/C-RuO2.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000809949300003

Defects in electrocatalysts strongly impact their chemical properties and can dramatically enhance the electrocatalytic performance. However, the rational tuning of defects and lattice distortions in electrocatalysts for efficient and stable electrolytic activity in alkaline media remains a challenge. Here, we highlighted defect- and lattice distortion-enriched 3D hierarchical Co9S8/Ni3S2 nanowire arrays supported on Ni foam to expose a greater number of active sites for an efficient OER. The obtained Ni foam supported Co9S8/Ni3S2 nanowire arrays exhibit an overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 79 mV dec(-1), which is comparable to and even better than the performance of the best OER electrocatalyst under alkaline conditions. This work also offers an approach for designing other advanced OER electrocatalysts for sustainable energy technology and devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000769566000001		
J	Su, Yi; Luo, Yonghao; Wu, Wenguang; Zhang, Yunliang; Zhao, Shanhui								Characteristics of pine wood oxidative pyrolysis: Degradation behavior, carbon oxide production and heat properties								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				98				137	143		10.1016/j.jaap.2012.07.005				NOV 2012	2012	Oxidative pyrolysis of pine wood was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with mass spectrometer (MS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) methods. The effects of oxygen concentration on pyrolysis behavior, carbon oxide production and heat properties were investigated. Several parameters were defined to evaluate the oxygen influence. It was found that oxygen dramatically promotes the oxidative degradation and char oxidation rate. The reactivity index was found to be proportional to the oxygen concentration, which suggested that oxidative degradation reactions were under increasingly kinetic control in elevated oxygen concentration environments. Carbon oxides evolution properties were investigated. There are two releasing peaks in MS curves for oxidative condition comparing with one peak under inert condition. They are related with oxidative degradation and char oxidation, respectively. Both total amounts and rates of carbon oxides emission were found to increase with oxygen concentration. The cumulative emission ratio of CO to CO2 first decreases then increases with oxygen concentration with 10% as turning point. It may be caused by different oxygen diffusion behaviors with variable oxygen concentrations. The absolute reaction heat value of oxidative pyrolysis (-7.23 MJ kg(-1), 5% O-2) is much larger than that of inert condition (+0.28 MJ kg(-1)). Increasing of oxygen concentration results in an increase of heat emission. Comparing with pine wood low heat value, the net heat emission efficiencies under different oxygen concentrations (5%, 10%, 15%, 21%) are 39.73%, 44.84%, 68.90% and 78.41%, respectively.

J	Crowtz, T. C.; Dahn, J. R.								Screening Bifunctional Pt Based NSTF Catalysts for Durability with the Rotating Disk Electrode: The Effect of Ir and Ru								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				165	10			F854	F862		10.1149/2.0891810jes				2018	2018	Various amounts of Ir (<20 mu g cm(-2)) and Ru (up to 12 mu g cm(-2)) on a consistent base Pt loading of 85 mu g cm(-2), were sputter deposited on a nanostructured thin film catalyst support to mimic a hydrogen fuel cell's cathode catalyst. The nanostructured support was grown on glassy carbon disks designed for a rotating disk electrode, which was used to simulate what happens to a fuel cell cathode during repeated start-up, operation, and shut-down. The testing protocol subjected the catalyst to a minimum potential of 0.65 V-RHE and a maximum between 1.53 and 1.8 V-RHE. The upper potential was achieved with a galvanostatic hold which is an alternative way to simulate potential transients on the cathode caused by start-up and shut-down. Increasing Ir loading improved the durability of both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. When combined with Ir, Ru provided no benefit to OER durability except at an Ir loading of 10 mu g cm(-2). Ru addition (no Ir present) improved the ORR durability compared to pure Pt. ORR durability was not influenced by Ru addition to Ir-containing samples. In general, ORR durability showed no dependence on Ru loading for all the Ru containing samples and ORR activity was decreased by OER catalyst addition, though more so for Ir than Ru.

The effect of dopant concentration, TiO2 thickness, and the concentration of the electroactive species in the solution was analyzed. A diminution of the electron transfer current with titanium oxide thickness was obtained whereas an increase of the current was found on augmenting Pt amount. At low titanium oxide thickness both inner-sphere reactions behave in the same way as in the case of pure Pt, indicating that platinum sites are the active ones. However, at higher titanium oxide thickness, the platinum sites become less active and the valve metal oxide (TiO2) begins to block OER and CLER reactions. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results are compared with those of the current-potential measurements and a good correlation is found between them.

Alkaline OER electrocatalyzed by Ni and Co hydroxides are well known which showed unexpected enhancement with the addition of Fe. We found that the commercially procured Cu foam containing trace amount of Ni (similar to 1.5 wt.%) upon anodization formed Cu(OH)(2)-CuO nanowires with conceivable formation of Ni(OH)(2) and experienced a notable enhancement in its OER activity. When sufficient amount of Fe was intentionally supplemented during anodization, OER activity of the same was further improved. Specifically, as a combined result of anodization in KOH and in Fe supplemented KOH, overpotential at 50 mA cm(-2) was lowered by 153 mV. Such an activation also improved the kinetics of OER by lowering the Tafel slope by 100 mV dec(-1). With these, it has been shown here that a moderately active OER catalyst i.e., Cu(OH)(2)-CuO/Cu formed upon the anodization of Cu foam can be turned into a highly active catalyst just by utilizing the trace Ni that it already contains and intentionally supplementing sufficient amount of Fe.

The effect of %Pt (w/w) and %H2WO4 (w/w) on the Pt-H2WO4 electrode performance was studied. The electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction, e.g., exchange current density, mass activity, and specific activity of a 2% Pt-H2WO4 based electrode was several times higher than those of 10% Pt. The performance of the 2% Pt-1%H2WO4 was not due to an increase of its electrochemically active surface area. This may be due to electronic interaction and synergetic effects between electrocatalyst and support and its chemical composition.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			0013-4651			WOS:A1994PA46300002

In particular, interface/surface engineering is an effective way to modify active sites and facilitate electron transfer, thereby improving OER performance. Herein, Co-based coordination polymer-derived hollow Co4S3@NiMoO4 nanotube was synthesized via a facile two-step solvothermal/hydrothermal method. [Co(C4H7NO4)]center dot xH(2)O (Co-Asp, Asp = L-aspartic acid) nanowire as morphological template to prepare hollow Co4S3 nanotube through the anion exchange. Then, Co4S3 was transformed into Co4S3 and NiMoO4 nanosheets were deposited on the surface of the Co4S3 nanotube in hydrothermal reaction. The hollow Co4S3 nanotube effectively avoids the aggregation of NiMoO4 nanosheets during the synthesis process. In addition, hollow Co4S3@NiMoO4 nanotube has dramatically increased surface area and more exposed active catalytic sites. Compared to a single Co4S3 and NiMoO4, hollow Co4S3@NiMoO4 nanotube exhibits good electrocatalytic OER performance with Tafel slopes of 102 mV dec(-1) and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 320 mV in 1.0 M KOH. At higher current density, the OER performance of hollow Co4S3@NiMoO4 nanotube is as good as that of commercial RuO2. More importantly, this work provides a novel template for interface/surface engineering, which can applied in other fields. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among these losses, the sluggish interfacial charge transfer of the vanadium species on the respective electrode renders large overpotentials giving rise to inevitable hydrogen and oxygen evolutions during the charging process. In this study, we report an unprecedented method based on the redox targeting concept to tackle the above issues. Prussian blue (PB) and a Prussian blue analogues (PBA) with identical redox potentials to VO2+/VO2+ and V2+/V3+ are grafted on cathode and anode, respectively. Upon operation, the reversible proton-coupled redox targeting reactions between PB and VO2+/VO2+ on cathode, PBA and V2+/V3+ on anode facilitate the interfacial charge transfer of the vanadium species and concomitantly inhibit the hydrogen and oxygen evolutions, which improves the selectivity of the redox reactions and considerably enhances the round-trip energy efficiency and cycling performance of VRB in a wide range of current densities. The above redox-assisted catalytic reactions were scrutinized and the mechanisms are unequivocally manifested with various electrochemical and spectroscopic measurements. We anticipate the surface immobilized redox catalysis approach demonstrated here would generically provide a paradigm for improving the sluggish kinetic processes in a variety of electrochemical devices.									29	1	0	0	3	0	29			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000444859700030

The electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, current density analyses, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results conclude that the monolayer deposition process accomplishes full coverage on the substrate and that the thickness of the deposition layer can be controlled on a single atom scale. It is found that a dual buffer, comprising a thin Ni coating and an Au nano-film, is necessary to cover carbon fiber substrate to ensure a complete monolayer Pt coverage. Moreover, the Pt monolayer is found to work better than thicker Pt -the best norm in the field, for catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient and prompt capture of oxygen intermediates has been a challenging research topic. In this issue of Joule, Bin Liu, Jingguang Chen, and colleagues developed an operando technique to probe the OH*, the first intermediate in the OER process. They found that the OH* is electrophilic. Inspired by the preferred combination of electrophiles and nucleophiles, they applied nucleophilic bait to catch the OH*. A clear sign is given by the current difference in the linear sweep voltammetry curve when alcohols such as methanol are added. This efficient in situ probing of oxygen intermediates opens a door for exploring the oxygen-involved process in energy storage and conversion research.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2542-4351			WOS:000472067900006

Experimental measurements and theoretical calculations on the lattice parameters of black TiO2 show that surface oxygen vacancies induce internal lattice strain during two-step aluminothermic reduction, which regulates the band structure and optimizes the photoinduced charge behavior of black TiO2. The hydrogen evolution rate of black TiO2 with strain modification shows a 12-fold increase to 1.882 mmol/g.h (equal to 4.705 mu mol/cm(2).h) under visible light illumination. The metastable state caused by the surface oxygen vacancies leads to the formation of a high-energy surface, which enhances visible light absorption and improves the photoinduced charge separation efficiency. Furthermore, the internal lattice strain provides the driving force and channel for the directional movement of photoinduced electrons from the bulk to the high-energy surface for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. This strategy provides a new method for designing a high-performance photocatalyst for H-2 production.									43	1	0	0	2	0	42			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000645520700035	33853323

Although precious metal-based mixed metal oxides (MMOs) have been widely used as CER catalysts, they suffer from the concomitant generation of oxygen during the CER. Herein, we demonstrate that atomically dispersed Pt-N-4 sites doped on a carbon nanotube (Pt-1/CNT) can catalyse the CER with excellent activity and selectivity. The Pt-1/CNT catalyst shows superior CER activity to a Pt nanoparticle-based catalyst and a commercial Ru/Ir-based MMO catalyst. Notably, Pt-1/CNT exhibits near 100% CER selectivity even in acidic media, with low Cl- concentrations (0.1M), as well as in neutral media, whereas the MMO catalyst shows substantially lower CER selectivity. In situ electrochemical X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the direct adsorption of Cl- on Pt-N-4 sites during the CER. Density functional theory calculations suggest the PtN4C12 site as the most plausible active site structure for the CER.									54	2	0	0	4	0	55			2041-1723			WOS:000511941200002	31964881

In this work, using earth-abundant transition metals (i.e., nickel, iron, and copper), 3D hierarchical nanoarchitectures, consisting of ultrathin Ni-Fe layered-double-hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH) nanosheets or porous Ni-Fe oxides (NiFeOx) assembled to a metallic NiCu alloy, are delicately constructed. In alkaline solution, the as-prepared Ni-Fe LDH@NiCu possesses outstanding OER activity, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 218 mV, which is smaller than that of RuO2 catalyst (249 mV). In contrast, the resulting NiFeOx@NiCu exhibits better HER activity, yielding a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 66 mV, which is slightly higher than that of Pt catalyst (53 mV) but superior to all other transition metal (hydr)oxide-based electrocatalysts. The remarkable activity of the Ni-Fe LDH@NiCu and NiFeOx@NiCu is further demonstrated by a 1.5 V solar-panel-powered electrolyzer, resulting in current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 293 and 506 mV, respectively. Such performance renders the as-prepared materials as the best bifunctional electrocatalysts so far.									101	3	0	0	7	0	101			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000459798700017	30589134

This model consists in a distributed equivalent circuit that describes the transport and charge storage of electroactive species coupled with the reaction throughout the internal surface. The evolution of the impedance spectra with the variation in the dc-applied voltage was predicted, and the measurements obtained showed a very good agreement with the theory. The model allows the evolution of parameters related to transport, charge storage, and reaction, to be followed under widely varying conditions, from the capacitive domain to the region of heavy current flow by intense surface reaction. The active surface sites play a dominant role both in the capacitive charging process and in the transport component of the impedance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

We present a rational tuning of the hole-accumulation and hole-transfer ability of a catalyst by in situ deposition of IrOx on NiOx islands on model Si electrodes and we demonstrate a distinct hole accumulation behavior during the OER through electrochemical methods, in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroelectrochemistry. We find that the NiOx islands with <10% coverage on an n++-Si dark electrode demonstrate a 6-fold higher capacity of hole accumulation relative to that on an n-Si photoanode under illumination. A further in situ targeted deposition of soluble hexahydroxyiridate on the NiOx leads to the formation of NiOx/IrOx junctions, where the IrOx further depletes the extracted holes by NiOx from the n-Si photoanode decreasing the overpotential by similar to 260 mV at 20 mA cm(-2), yet the IrOx promotes the hole accumulation at the NiOx/IrOx on the dark electrodes presenting a similar decrease of the overpotential. In contrast to the dark-holes, an extremely lower charging level of photogenerated holes of the same catalyst at the identical current density reasoned a seemingly higher reactivity to drive the OER, and reasonably demonstrated a stronger oxidation/ corrosion to the Si electrode.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200012

Nickel and its alloys are promising materials to substitute noble metals. Nickel based materials are cost-effective with good availability and show comparable catalytic performances. The nickel molybdenum system is a very interesting alternative to platinum in water electrolysis. We produced ligand-free nickel-molybdenum nanoparticles by laser ablation in water and acetone. Our results show that segregated particles were formed in water due to the oxidation of the metals. X-ray diffraction shows a significant change in the lattice parameter due to a diffusion of molybdenum atoms into the nickel lattice with increasing activity in the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. Even though the solubility of molecular oxygen in acetone is higher than in water, there were no oxides and a more homogeneous metal distribution in the particles in acetone as seen by TEM-EDX. This showed that dissolved molecular oxygen does not control oxide formation. Overall, the laser ablation of pressed micro particulate mixtures in liquids offers a combinational synthesis approach that allows the screening of alloy nanoparticles for catalytic testing and can convert micro-mixtures into nano-alloys.

The results show that the monolayer possesses thermodynamic stability, suitable bandgap (similar to 1.89 eV), low excitons binding energy (similar to 0.19 eV) together with high hole mobility (similar to 10(3) cm(2 )V(-1) s(-1)). Notably, the results suggest that the oxygen evolution reaction can undergo spontaneously without any sacrificial reagents. In contrast, the overpotential of hydrogen evolution reaction can partially be overcome by the external potential under solar light irradiation. Furthermore, the intrinsic electric field induced by the symmetry breaking along the perpendicular direction of Janus WSeTe monolayer not only suppresses the electron-hole recombination but also contributes to the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, which is calculated to be similar to 19%. These characteristics make the Janus WSeTe monolayer to be a promising candidate for solar water splitting.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000709975300001	34614482

The resultant Ni3S2-NGQDs/NF can serve as an active, binder-free, and self-supported catalytic electrode for direct water splitting, which delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 216 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 218 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. This bifunctional electrocatalyst enables the construction of an alkali electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.58 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10 mA cm(-2). The experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effects of the constructed active interfaces are the key factor for excellent performance. The nanocomposite of NGQDs and Ni3S2 nanosheets can be promising water splitting electrocatalyst for large-scale hydrogen generation or other energy storage and conversion applications.									103	7	0	0	4	0	105			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000403805900008	28481435

Herein, a facile approach to deposit Pt nanoparticles on two-dimensional V2C MXene (Pt/V2CTx) is achieved. Pt nanoparticles with narrow size distribution (similar to 3 nm) and high loading capacity are uniformly anchored on the surface of V2CTx. The obtained catalysts possess outstanding activity and stability for HER. In 0.5 M H2SO4 , the overpotential of Pt/V2CTx (20%) is 67 mV, and the Tafel slope is 20.6 mV/dec. The oxygen-rich surface of V2CTx can provide good hydrophilicity, low hydrogen adsorption free energy and oxophilicity to provide abundant bonding sites for Pt nanoparticles. Moreover, the intrinsically excellent conductivity of V2CTx and strong coupling between V2CTx and Pt are also of benefit for improving the charge transfer and accelerating the HER kinetics. Therefore, Pt/V2CTx may be a promising candidate for HER.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000760272900004

The ultrathin structure helps in enhancing the conductivity with the increase in exposed active sites which ultimately facilitates the cat-alytic activity of the 2-D bimetallic MOFs for energy applications. The catalytic activity of 2-D bimetallic MOF can be explained using electroanalytical methods like impedance, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel plots. To understand catalysis at the molecular level in terms of the charge transfer kinetics and study the effect of unsaturated metal sites on catalysis density functional theory can be employed. Unfortunately, only a few reports have been published to explore 2-D bimetallic MOF for applications like water splitting reactions (oxygen evolution reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions), and energy stor-age devices (batteries, supercapacitors, and pseudocapacitors).

However, few of them are capable of photocatalytic overall water splitting. Here, by means of first-principles calculations within the quasi-particle approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we demonstrated a unique framework of triphenylenes (sp(2)) and acetylenic linkages (sp), namely triphenyldiyne (TDY) that has the electronic band structure suitable for photocatalytic overall water splitting along with pronounced optical absorbance in visible light. The redox ability of its photogenerated electrons is high enough to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Through Ni doping with TDY, its overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be reduced to match the redox ability of its photogenerated holes, enabling the photocatalytic overall water splitting in sunlight without the need of sacrificial reagents. This work offers not only a low-cost, earth-abundant and environmental-friendly photocatalyst, but also a promising strategy for designing highly efficient photocatalysts for overall water splitting.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000571344300063	32936175

Electrocatalytic water splitting suffers from sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics leading to low energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a strategy is presented that integrates anodic electrochemical flocculation with cathodic hydrogen production from water splitting in 0.5 m Na2SO4. Iron encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes array on iron foam (Fe@N-CNT/IF) is employed as an electrode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the Fe@N-CNT/IF possesses superior HER activity requiring an overpotential of 525 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2), which is close to that of 20 wt% Pt/C. Benefiting from the lower oxidation potential of iron (E degrees(Fe/Fe2+), 0.44 V) than that of OER (E-OH-/O2(0), 1.23 V), the cell voltage for integrated electrochemical flocculation and H-2 production is significantly reduced by 1.31 V relative to overall water splitting to achieve 20 mA cm(-2). More important, the production of electrochemical flocculation can be applied to water purification, because of the excellent adsorption capacity. Finally, metal-carbon electrocatalysts are prepared again by pyrolysis of flocculation adsorbents containing toxic heavy metals and organics. This result provides a new direction for designing a heterogeneous electrolysis system for energy conversion and environmental treatment applications.									55	5	0	0	5	0	55				2198-3844		WOS:000476593500001	31559143

Herein, we report for the first time the synthesis of one dimensional (1D) hollow MFe2O4 (M = Cu, Co and Ni) fibers by the Solution Blow Spinning (SBS) technique and their performance towards OER in alkaline medium. The formation mechanism of the hollow structure and the influence of the fibrillar morphology on the performance of electrocatalysts were discussed. Electrocatalytic performance to generate 10 mA cm(-2) with low overpotential followed the sequence: CuFe2O4 > CoFe2O4 > NiFe2O4. The improved OER performance of hollow CuFe2O4 fibers is due to a superior number of active sites exposed to surface reactions, confirmed by a remarkable electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 225 cm(2). Solution blow spun hollow ferrite fibers showed better electrocatalytic activity towards OER than 1D, 2D and 3D ferrite-based nanostructures reported in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The first-row transition-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with high activity have been developed to replace the noble-metal catalysts, e.g., RuO2 and IrO2. In the work reported in this paper, we developed the Ni-Fe Prussian-blue analog (PBA) on the Ni foam surface (PBA/NF) via an in situ electrodeposition method and transferred the PBA/NF into bimetallic phosphides (NiFePx/NF) through the phosphidation process as highly active OER electrocatalysts in alkaline medium. The in situ electrodeposition method could not only precisely control the nucleation and growth processes of PBA on the surface of nickel foam, as well as the purity, structures, and morphologies of the deposits obtained, but also provide sufficient adhesive force between catalysts and Ni foam substrates without further use of poorly conductive binder material, which guaranteed robust electrode stability. When applying for OER, NiFePx/NF presented excellent catalytic activity. Upon screening a wide electrodeposition time range, results demonstrate that NiFePx-80/NF (deposition time 80 min) possessed the best OER catalytic activity with only 224 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a Tafel slope of 29 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, which shows that the use of electrodeposition methods to directly grow PBA nanomaterials on conductive substrates may be an effective method for the preparation of multifunctional electrocatalysts.

Furthermore, perovskite-structured materials can be utilized as an oxygen electrode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) at even elevated temperatures due to their distinctive layered structure, providing great flexibility regarding the modification of their electronic configurations. Herein, we investigate whether alkaline earth metaldoped bismuth iron oxides (Bi0.6M0.4FeO3, M = Ba, Sr, Ca, and Mg) can act as both bifunctional catalysts for URFCs and cathode materials for SOFCs. Among these, Bi0.6Ca0.4FeO3 (BCFO) exhibits remarkable OER and ORR catalytic performances, with better long-term stability than that of a pristine BiFeO3 (BFO) catalyst in alkaline media at room temperature. Moreover, the DC conductivity of BCFO is more than 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of the BFO material at 500-700 degrees C for SOFCs. In addition, BCFO has a aTEC value of 12.4x10(-6) K-1 at 25-650 degrees C, which is near those of yttria-stabilized zirconia and rare-earth-doped ceria electrolytes. Hence, BCFO demonstrates potential as an oxygen electrode material for operation at room and elevated temperatures.									14	2	0	0	0	0	15			2046-2069			WOS:000412977000049

The tubular FeOOH microstructures were first obtained by a heating reflux route. Then, tubular ferrite MFe2O4 (M = Fe, Co, Ni) microstructures were produced by a solvothermal method. The as-prepared products were characterized by the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and EDS mapping. Experiments showed that as-obtained ferrite catalysts demanded the overpotentials of -201 similar to-359 mV or similar to 340-432 mV to afford the current density of -/+10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long-term durability for 50 h in 1.0 M KOH solution. Among them, NiFe2O4 tubular microstructures presented the best electrocatalytic activities for HER and OER due to the largest BET specific surface area, the highest electrochemical active surface area and the smallest chargetransfer resistance.

Consequently, they exhibit a superior activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with ultralow overpotentials of 176 and 240 mV at 10 and 300 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH (aq), respectively. CoFe(dobpdc)-III also shows a record low overpotential of 204 mV at J(10) mA cm(-2) among the electrocatalysts based on CoFe MOF and an excellent overpotential at a high current density (100 mA cm(-2)) of 312 mV in 0.1 M KOH (aq). This is the first report of a convenient method to straighten up MOF nanorods on a template for highly efficient OER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000667982100048	34110779

Due to their structural diversity and ultra-high surface area, metal-organic framework (MOF) ultrathin nanosheets have expected to provide not only more accessible active sites, but also faster mass transfer and diffusion and have been realized as OER electrocatalysts. Therefore, we develop the controllable synthesis of Co-based MOF ultrathin nanosheets (NMOF-Co) incorporated with different-valence Fe ions, which are used as a high-performance electrocatalyst via a post-synthetic modification method. The binary metal electrocatalyst demonstrated more effective kinetics than the single metal electrocatalysts. By virtue, the obtained electrocatalyst with a uniform thickness of similar to 4.0 nm (defined as (Fe(II)(1)Fe(III)(1))(0.6)/NMOF-Co) sets in at potential of only 1.56 V with small Tafel slope of 50 mV.dec(-1), which is more superb than that of RuO2 and bulk material Fe(II)(1)Fe(III)(1))(0.6)/Bulk-MOF-Co. The findings show that the structure of ultrathin nanosheets and the Fe incorporation are critical to the outstanding performance of MOF nanosheets for tuning the electrocatalytic activity, which is of great significance in the field of MOF electrocatalysis.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000672588600004

The structural evolution and reducibility of Ce-Fe oxygen carriers with calcination temperatures from 600 to 900 degrees C were investigated by XRD, BET, Raman, XPS and TPR techniques and correlated to their activity for methane selective oxidation. The Ce-Fe mixed oxides calcined at low temperatures (e.g., 600 degrees C) show abundant oxygen vacancies and high specific surface areas, which enhances the concentration of surface adsorbed oxygen and favors the complete oxidation of methane by means of gas-solid reactions. On the other hand, a calcination temperature of 900 degrees C results in serious sintering and militates against the formation of Ce-Fe solid solution, which brings about catalytic methane decomposition because of the low lattice oxygen mobility. A compromise calcination temperature at 800 degrees C favors the interaction between iron and cerium oxides, which could improve the lattice oxygen mobility of Ce-Fe oxygen carrier, leading to a high reactivity for methane selective oxidation. More importantly, the lattice oxygen mobility of the oxygen carrier is enhanced by the generation of oxygen vacancies after a repetitive redox treatment (methane reduction/air re-oxidation), which allows the Ce-Fe oxygen carrier to maintain a high activity and stability during the successive production of synthesis gas through a redox process.

VIII group transition metal phosphides (TMPs) gradually stand out due to their intriguing properties including low resistance, excellent catalytic activity and stability. Herein, we adopt an unconventional metal-organic framework (MOF) as precursor as well as an optimized pyrolytic strategy to fabricate a unique hybrid of bundled N-doped carbon nanowires confined small-sized cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanocrystals (CoP/NCNWs). As a HER catalyst, CoP/NCNWs hybrid exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential and durable long-term stability in both acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively, which could be ascribed to the structural integrity of the hybrid and the synergetic effects between catalytically active CoP components and the protective N-doped carbon matrixes. Furthermore, the as-synthesized nanocomposite also presents favorable performances toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This research provides an operable strategy to construct low-dimensional carbonaceous materials coupled with TMPs using MOFs as precursor and shows the promising potential of multifunctional nanomaterials in electrocatalytic applications.

Evolution of gases (CO, CO2, H-2, and CH4) was quantified as a function of temperature in the range 700 degrees C to 935 degrees C and CO2/C ratios in the range of 0.5-1.5 (wt/wt). The main aim of this study was to determine the effect of temperature and CO2/C ratios on the output syngas and to understand which reactions were influential withinthe operational limits of the experimental parameters. Additionally, results from CO2 gasification and oxygen gasification were thoroughly compared. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the significance of changes in operating parameters on the process. Variation in temperature seemed to have a Significant effect on the output, whereas the effects of CO2/C ratios were not that profound. The analyses of the gas evolution trends suggested that the Boudouard reaction, char reforming'reaction, and free radical combination reactions dominated the chemistry of the process,									47	1	0	0	7	0	48			0888-5885			WOS:000372479000025		
J	Nylen, Linda; Gustavsson, John; Cornell, Ann					/0000-0001-5816-2924			Cathodic reactions on an iron RDE in the presence of Y(III)								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				155	10			E136	E142		10.1149/1.2958299				2008	2008	During electrolysis of a solution containing Y(III) ions, a hydrous Y(OH)(3) film forms in the alkaline layer close to a hydrogen-evolving cathode. The film hinders the reduction of dissolved oxygen and activates the reduction of water, hydrogen evolution. The ability to hinder certain reactions while catalyzing hydrogen evolution may be useful in electrolysis applications. In this work the electrochemical properties of an in situ formed yttrium-hydroxide film were studied on an iron rotating disk electrode (RDE) in 0.5 M NaCl with addition of YCl3, NaClO, and of NaNO3. It was found that the film also hinders the reduction of protons, hypochlorite ions, and nitrate ions. At low concentration of Y(III) or at high current density, when the hydrogen evolution was vigorous, no activation of hydrogen evolution was observed. Under these conditions the film still hindered the reduction of ions. The reactant in the catalyzed hydrogen evolution reaction is most likely water molecules within the hydrous film. Nitrate ions were easily reduced on an iron cathode when no Y(III) ions were present in the solution. When studying effects of yttrium addition to a chloride solution the use of YCl3, rather than Y(NO3)(3), as Y(III) source is recommended.

Herein, we report cobalt disulphide encapsulated in self-catalyzed carbon nanotubes (S, N-CNTs/CoS2@Co) serving as a bifunctional catalyst, which exhibits excellent hydrogen evolution reaction performance (10.0 mA cm(-2) at 0.112 V, and low Tafel slope for 104.9 mV dec(-1)) and oxygen evolution reaction performance (10.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.57 V, and low Tafel slope for 76.1 mV dec(-1)), meanwhile with a strong stability at various current densities. In-depth study reveals that the excellent catalytic properties can be mainly attributed to the increased catalytic sites induced by S, N co-doping, the improved electronic conductivity derived from the carbon nanotubes, and Mott-Schottky effect between the metal cobalt and semiconductive cobalt disulfide. Notably, when the bifunctional catalysts are applied to overall water splitting, a low potential of 1.633 V at the current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2) is achieved, which can compete with the precious metal catalyst benchmarks in alkaline media, demonstrating its promising practicability in the realistic water splitting application. This work elucidates a practicable way to the design of transition metal and nano-carbon composite catalysts for a broad application in the fields of energy chemistry. (C) 2018 Science China Press.

Each compound has been stabilized with two different oxygen stoichiometries. The structural study shows, firstly, the good cationic homogeneity of the samples and, secondly, that the Sc and Fe atoms are randomly distributed over the same crystallographic site, whatever the scandium content. This implies that no anionic order is possible. A detailed Mossbauer spectroscopy study clearly shows that the substitution of scandium for iron involves an oxygen content decrease which decreases the tetravalent iron content until its total disappearance for x=0.5. The evolutions of the isomer shift, the quadrupolar splitting and the relative intensity versus the Sc3+ content are depicted in the present paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, cobalt single-atom anchored on nitrogen-doped graphene-sheet@tube (CoSAs-NGST) is derived from a novel Co, Zn-coordinated zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoZn-ZIF) in the presence of dicyandiamide. CoSAs-NGST exhibited a hybrid structure with a bamboo-like graphene tube and sheet. The atomic configuration of intrinsic defects is characterized by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The morphology differentiation from cake-shape structure to low-dimension hybrid not only enhances the dispersity of single atoms but also induces defect state evolution, which results in the formation of a CoN4-rich graphene tube. Density functional theory (DFT) modeling revealed that the coupling effect on oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR/OER) pathways of Co-N-4-tube and Co-N-4-sheet is responsible for the enhanced activity of CoSAs-NGST. In addition to the superb ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic performance, CoSAs-NGST also demonstrates a notably small charge-discharge voltage drop of 0.93 V when applied in the rechargeable zinc-air battery outperforming Pt/C + RuO2 catalyst. The present study provides an insight into the relationship between the structure design and atomic modulation of the carbon based catalysts.									57	4	0	0	2	0	57			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000623181800001

Constructing heterogeneous structures can integrate distinct individual properties into one entity and can yield exceptional functionalities. Herein, we report heterogeneous NiS2/CoS2 nanohybrids that are synthesized by successive ion injection method. Benefiting from the synergistic effect, the weak lattice distortion and the electronic modulation, the NiS2/CoS2 electrode exhibits much more catalytic active sites and faster electronic transfer rate, thus leading to better oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performances in KOH solution than the individual NiS2 and CoS2. Moreover, the solid state Zn-air battery (SSZAB) with NiS2/CoS2 as the air electrode exhibits a peak power density of 101 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 734 mAh g(-1). For practical application, the two-series-connected NiS2/CoS2-based SSZABs can power light-emitting diode (LED) screens and water splitting system efficiently. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties of NiS2/CoS2 in solid state electrolyte deserve further investigation.

Among many low-cost metal based candidates, transition metal oxides with the CNTs composite have gained increasing attention. In this paper, the 3-D hollow sphere MnO2 nanotube-supported Co3O4 nanoparticles and its carbon nanotubes hybrid material (Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs) have been synthesized via a simple co-precipitation method combined with post-heat treatment. The morphology and composition of the catalysts are thoroughly analyzed through SEM, TEM, TEM-mapping, XRD, EDX and XPS. In comparison with the commercial 20% Pt/C, Co3O4/MnO2, bare MnO2 nanotubes and CNTs, the hybrid Co3O4/MnO2-CNTs-350 exhibits perfect bi-functional catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline condition (0.1 M KOH). Therefore, high cell performances are achieved which result in an appropriate open circuit voltage (similar to 1.47 V), a high discharge peak power density (340 mW cm(-2)) and a large specific capacity (775 mAh g(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2)) for the primary Zn-air battery, a small charge-discharge voltage gap and a high cycle-life (504 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2) with 10 min per cycle) for the rechargeable Zn-air battery. In particular, the simple synthesis method is suitable for a large-scale production of this bifunctional material due to a green, cost effective and readily available process.

Materials were obtained by using low temperature malic acid sol-gel route. To know the redox behaviour, electrocatalytic activity and thermodynamic parameters of oxides, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and anodic polarization curve (Tafel plot) were recorded in 1 M KOH at 25 degrees C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study indicates the formation of almost pure perovskite phase of the material. A pair of redox peaks was observed (anodic; Ep(a) = 494 +/- 12 mV and corresponding cathodic; Ep(c) = 360 +/- 4 mV) in the potential region 0.0-0.7 V prior to onset of OER. As observed in the case of La-based perovskite oxides, Sr-substitutions in the SmNiO3 also enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the material. However, Sm-based oxides showed least electrocatalytic activity as compared to La-based oxides. The estimated values of Tafel slope and reaction order indicate that each oxide electrode, except SmNiO3, follows similar mechanistic path towards OER. Standard entropy of activation (Delta S degrees(#)), standard enthalpy of activation (Delta H degrees(#)) and standard electrochemical energy of activation (Delta H-el degrees(#)) was determined by recording the anodic polarization curve in 1M KOH at different temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1480-2422	2292-1168		WOS:000767315600008

The earth-abundant high-valency metals, especially vanadium, can modulate the electronic structure of 3d metal oxides and oxyhydroxides and offer the active sites near-optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates. Here, the authors propose a facile assembling and regulating strategy to controllably synthesize a serial of transition metal (CoFe, NiFe, and NiCo)-based vanadates for efficient OER catalysis. By tuning the reaction concentrations, NiFe-based vanadates with different crystallinities can be facilely regulated, where the catalyst with moderate heterophase (mixed crystalline and amorphous structures) shows the best OER catalytic activity in terms of low overpotential (267 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), low Tafel slope (38 mV per decade), and excellent long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte, exceeding its noble metal-based counterparts (RuO2) and most current existing OER catalysts. This work not only reports a facile and controllable method to synthesize a series of vanadates-based catalysts with heterophase nanostructures for high-performance OER catalysis, but also may expand the scope of designing cost-effective transition metal-based electrocatalysts for water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000726558700001	34866325

The EGSI was firstly treated in Fe2+, Ni2+ and urea mixture to obtain FexNiyOH/EGSI and then were further transformed into FexNiyOOH/EGSI by the electrooxidation in NaOH solution. SEM results indicated various morphologies including nanoflowers, nanosheets and cubes could be obtained depending on the ratio of Fe2+ and Ni2+. Raman spectra, XRD and electrochemical results indicated that the NiOOH was produced in electrooxidation process, which improved its catalytic activity of OER remarkably. Besides, modest Fe-doping could make it achieve better catalytic activity because Fe-doping could alter the redox properties of NiFe hydroxide to result in low overpotential. As a result, the FexNiyOOH/EGSI presented good OER and HER performances. The optimum Fe1.5Ni0.5OOH/EGSI as cathode and Fe0.2Ni1.8OOH/EGSI as anode were applied for water splitting, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.69 V, indicating that it could work at a lower potential.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			2365-6549			WOS:000459318200022

The defect-rich Co-CeO(x & nbsp;)cocatalyst modification improves the conductivity, light absorption, charge transfer efficiency, and surface photo voltage generation of the Co-CeOx/Sb-TiO2 hybrid NRs photoanode. The Co-CeO(x & nbsp;)cocatalyst also serves as the surface passivating overlayer for the Sb-TiO2 photoanode, which suppresses the surface states mediated recombination of electron-hole pairs in the NRs. The PEC studies further indicate that Co-CeO(x & nbsp;)cocatalyst induces remarkably large band bending at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface and shortens the carrier diffusion length and depletion layer width, facilitating the rapid separation and transportation of the photocarriers for the surface PEC reactions. The experimental and theoretical studies confirm that the Co-doping in CeO(x & nbsp;)cocatalyst enhances the surface oxygen vacancy defects, which provides active catalytic sites for OH- adsorption and charge transportation for enhanced OER kinetics. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate a higher conductivity of the Co-CeO(x & nbsp;)cocatalyst, advantageous for rapid charge transfer capability during PEC reactions. The synergy between all these merits helps the optimized Co-CeOx/Sb-TiO2 photoanode to deliver a maximum photocurrent density of 1.41 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and an ultra-low turn on potential (V-on) of 0.1 V-RHE under AM 1.5G solar illumination compared to the Sb-TiO2 NRs (0.96 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE and V-on = 0.42 V-RHE). This work demonstrates the design of an efficient defect-rich cocatalyst modified photoanode for solar energy harvesting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

To enhance the stability of electrocatalyst and reduce the cost, it is of paramount importance to reveal the active site's dynamics (using in situ techniques for getting the real-time information) which directly affect the reactions such as oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and so on. Since such reactions are crucial for many engineering and scientific applications, in situ characterization techniques are required, which could capture such reactions happening at a different length and time scale. This article analyzes the recent progress made in the field of electrocatalyst's characterization using in situ neutron techniques. The article also paves the future path and has delineated the future challenges involved in multiscale correlative techniques (e.g., neutron techniques in the combination of synchrotron or microscopic techniques) used for getting the multiscale (atomic to micrometer range) mechanistic information about the electrocatalyst's working and degradation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2451-9103			WOS:000819856600022

Surface engineering, such as the introduction of oxygen vacancies into NiFe LDH, has been reported to further improve the OER performance; however, searching a facile approach remains an issue. In this work, we report a novel and efficient electrochemical reduction method for in situ introduction of oxygen vacancies into NiFe LDH laminates by applying a constant negative voltage. The results show that the reduced NiFe LDH (denoted as r-NiFe LDH) exhibits enhanced OER performance versus its counterpart NiFe due to the increase of oxygen vacancy density, the electrochemically active surface area, wetting ability, and the significant electron transfer rate. In 1 M KOH, the r-NiFe LDH shows a high current density of 110 mA cm(-2) at 1.60 V (vs. RHE), which is 2.8 times the current density of NiFe LDH (40 mA cm(-2)), as well as the long-term stability of 100 h. This electroreduction method is also applicable to other LDH materials loaded by different current substrates or synthesized by various methods, demonstrating its universality for the enhancement of the OER activity of LDH electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000847514500001	36040751

These techniques have proven to be very powerful for the characterization and identification of homogeneous kinetics coupled to the charge transfer, with high sensitivity and reduced capacitive and background effects.From the general analytical expressions here deduced, interesting limiting cases and eccentric behaviours are revealed. Methodologies and tools are given for the extraction of the chemical kinetics and thermodynamics on the basis of the analysis of the RPV limiting current, RPV cross potential and DDPV peak potential. The results can be valuable for the investigation of outstanding processes such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the voltammetry of which can be described in a first approach by the IT-CeqC mechanism.

This monolayer appears to have outstanding stability as revealed by its energetic, kinetic, thermodynamic, and mechanic calculations, and it can withstand temperatures as high as 900 K. Monolayer delta-SnS is a wide direct-bandgap (2.354 eV) semiconductor, and its electron mobility is as high as similar to 1.25 x 10(3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), higher than that of monolayer KTlO (similar to 450 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and MoS2 (similar to 200 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). Optical absorption spectra, reaching up to the order of similar to 10(5) cm(-1), are obviously excellent in the visible-light region, suggesting efficient harvesting of solar radiation. Because of its unique atomic motif, monolayer delta-SnS presents an unusual bidirectional auxetic effect: a high negative in-plane Poisson's ratio (-0.048 and -0.068), which is larger than those for many recently reported two-dimensional auxetic materials, e.g., black phosphorene (-0.027), borophene (-0.04), and monolayer penta-B2N4 (-0.02). The bandgap and band edge can be substantially manipulated under strain to meet the requirement of the water-splitting reaction. Particularly, when pH = 7, suitable band-edge alignments and small overpotentials of the photocatalytic OER (oxygen evolution reaction) and HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) appear, endowing monolayer delta-SnS with great potential as an efficient visible-light-driven bifunctional photocatalyst for water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000674333400060	34196545

Herein, we report an active mesoporous Ni2P @ FePO(x)Hy pre-electrocatalyst, which delivers high j = 1 A cm(-2) at eta = 360 mV in 1 M KOH with long-term durability (12 days), fulfilling all the desirable commercial criteria for OER. The electrocatalyst shows abundant interfaces between crystalline metal phosphide and amorphous phosphorus-doped metal-oxide, improving charge transfer capability and providing access to rich electroactive sites. Combined with an excellent non-noble metal-based HER catalyst, we achieve commercially required j = 500/1000 mA cm(-2) at 1.65/1.715 V for full water-splitting with excellent stability in highly corrosive alkaline environment (30% KOH). The alkaline-anion-exchange-membrane water-electrolyzer (AAEMWE) fabricated for commercial viability exhibits high j of 1 A cm(-2) at 1.84 V with long-term durability as an economical hydrogen production method, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C-IrO2 catalyst.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000783882000004

Herein, we report a novel heterogeneous catalyst comprising Ni3S2 nanoparticles embedded in ultrathin NiV-layered double hydroxide nanosheet arrays supported on nickel foam, denoted as Ni3S2@NiV-LDH/NF. We demonstrate that the active edge-state length and the surface chemical state of such NiV-LDH-based heterostructures are well modulated by tailoring the coupling interfaces, resulting in the exposure of more catalytic reaction sites and enhancement of the electronic interactions between NiV-LDH and Ni3S2, thus greatly promoting the water dissociation kinetics. As expected, the optimized Ni3S2@NiV-LDH/NF heterostructures exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an extremely low overpotential of 126 mV and 190 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER without iR compensation in alkaline media, respectively. More importantly, Ni3S2@NiV-LDH/NF simultaneously functioned as both the anode and cathode for water splitting to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of only 1.53 V with an outstanding durability for 160 h. This work provides a new insight into the regulation of the coupling interface for obtaining highly active heterostructured catalysts for overall water splitting.									96	4	0	0	3	0	97			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000469245300019	31012892

The ZnO nanorods were uniformly and firmly grown on the indium tin oxide glass and possessed high photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution performance. Then electrocatalysis Nickel-borate were deposited onto the surface of ZnO with electro-assisted photodeposition method. The composite photoanodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) , X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the W-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, and the photoelectrochemical water oxidation properties of ZnO/Ni-Bi composite photoanodes were investigated by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical methods. The effect of deposition methods, deposition time and heat treatment progress to the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution performance of the ZnO/Ni-Bi composited photoanodes were investigated. The performance of ZnO is improved for as high as 40% after coupling with Ni-Bi. The high oxygen evolution activity of the composite photoanodes can be attributed to separation and inhibit of hole-electron recombination by Ni-Bi through facilitating the transfer of photon-induced holes from ZnO for water oxidation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-6893			INSPEC:15495029

This paper develops a 2D numerical method to investigate the self ignition of coal dust layers with an emphasis on the roles of the oxygen mole fraction and diluent gas. A global one-step 2nd-order reaction kinetic model considering both coal density and oxygen density is used to estimate the reaction rate of self-heating process until ignition. In addition, the overall heat transfer coefficient is evaluated based on a steady state method and the kinetic parameters are estimated by fitting experimental and numerical temperature evolution figures. This model has been found to be valid to predict the transient temperature and concentration profiles until ignition. The numerical results of the minimum ignition temperature of dust layers (MITL) are in close agreement with experimental observations. The ignition delay time and the most sensitive ignition position (MSIP) of dust layer are found to vary with varying ambient gas conditions, hot plate temperatures and ambient temperatures using the verified model. The model provides a satisfactory explanation for the dependence of ignition characteristics of coal dust layer in oxygen-enriched oxy-fuel atmospheres. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nickel phosphides have been widely explored for electrocatalytic HER due to their unique electronic properties, efficient electrocatalytic performance, and a superior anti-corrosion feature. However, the HER activities of nickel phosphide electrocatalysts are still low for practical applications in electrolyzers, and further studies are necessary. Therefore, at the current stage, a specific comprehensive review is necessary to focus on the progresses of the nickel phosphide electrocatalysts. This review focuses on the developments of preparation approaches of nickel phosphides for HER, including a mechanism of HER, properties of nickel phosphides, and preparation and electrocatalytic HER performances of nickel phosphides. The progresses of the preparation and HER activities of the nickel phosphide electrocatalysts are mainly discussed by classification of the preparation method. The comparative surveys of their HER activities are made in terms of experimental metrics of overpotential at a certain current density and Tafel slope together with the preparation method. The remaining challenges and perspectives of the future development of nickel phosphide electrocatalysts for HER are also proposed.									26	0	0	0	0	0	26				2073-4344		WOS:000519998900046

Herein, a bimetallic phosphide composite (Co2P@NC-Fe2P) is successfully synthesized from a ferric hydroxyphosphate-zeolitic imidazolate framework hybrid precursor (FeHP-ZIF-67). Benefitting from morphology and composition regulations, the FeHP-ZIF-67 precursor is prepared by a room-temperature solution synthesis method, which exhibits an optimal morphology, where FeHP microspheres are coated with excess ZIF-67 nanoparticles. During the annealing of FeHP-ZIF-67, FeHP serves as a source of phosphorus to form Fe2P and Co2P simultaneously, where Co2P nanoparticles coated with an N-doped carbon (NC) matrix derived from ZIF-67 are partially adsorbed onto the surface of Fe2P microspheres, thereby forming numerous NC-Fe2P interfaces. The optimal Co2P@NC-Fe2P composite has an overpotential of 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), and long-term stability of over 35 h in an alkaline medium for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Such a superior OER performance is attributed to the active NC-Fe2P interfaces in the Co2P@NC-Fe2P composite. This work provides a new strategy to optimize transition-metal phosphides with effective interfaces for OER electrocatalysis.									40	1	0	0	0	0	39			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000541679900037	32412228

Herein, one-dimensional porous Fe3S4-Fe7Se8 heterostructured nanowires confined in carbon (Fe3S4-Fe7Se8@C) were synthesized via the selenization of Fe-based organic-inorganic nanowires. Benefiting from the merits of morphology, composition and surface structure characteristics, i.e., the high structural void porosity, the direct electrical pathways of nanowire topology and the conductive carbon layer coating, the titled catalyst not only offered a larger accessible electrocatalytic interface but also facilitated diffusion of the electrolyte and gas. Moreover, the electron redistribution at the Fe3S4-Fe7Se8 heterojunction interfaces reduced the adsorption free-energy barriers on the active sites, endowing the catalysts with faster reaction kinetics and improved electrocatalytic activity. Accordingly, the optimal Fe3S4-Fe7Se8@C produced a low hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential of 124 mV at 10 mA cm (-2) with a Tafel slope of 111.2 mV dec(-1), and an ultralow oxygen evolution reactions overpotential of 219 mV at 20 mA cm (-2 ), respectively. When applied as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a low battery voltage of 1.67 V was achieved along with excellent stability for at least 12 h.

Steady state polarization curves obtained in different aqueous xM NaOH (0.1 less-than-or-equal-to x less-than-or-equal-to 4) in the 30-80-degrees-C range fulfill Tafel relationships at low overpotentials; the Tafel slope is close to 2.3(RT/F) V dec-1 for both G-16 and oxide coated G-16 electrodes. At high overpotentials, ohmic relationships with slopes becoming increasingly steep, regardless of the NaOH concentration, are observed. In the Tafel region, the reaction order with respect to OH- is near 2. The apparent current density at constant potential, for oxide coated G-16 electrodes, is greater than that for uncoated G-16. The high catalytic activity of the oxide coated G-16 for the o.e.r. is attributed to its spinel-type structure. The kinetics of the o.e.r. at low overpotentials is explained through a mechanism involving a first electron transfer step followed by a rate-determining chemical step.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			0021-891X			WOS:A1994NF90000005

At the origin of both the activity and the instability of iridium oxides used as OER catalysts in acid conditions is the formation of high-valence IrOx intermediates such as IrO3. Nevertheless, owing to its reactivity with water, this intermediate was never stabilized, and its electrochemical/chemical behavior was never studied in depth. Here, we report a strategy to stabilize this elusive IrO3 intermediate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that upon reactivity with water, gaseous oxygen is generated, while the intermediate is protonated following the reaction IrO3 + xH(2)O -> H2xIrO3 + x/2O(2). The resulting hydrated iridium oxide H2IrO3, which possesses three-dimensional proton intercalation/deintercalation channels, can be considered as an enlightening OER model electrocatalyst in acidic media. Owing to its unique proton insertion ability, we could study a yet ill-described charge compensation mechanism upon OER relying on the bulk reversible exchange of protons, which shows remarkable performances and stability. Indeed, enhanced OER is measured, with a dissolution rate lower than the one measured for the "stellar" IrOx /SrIrO3 catalyst. Such a finding opens the route toward the design of new catalysts enlisting proton insertion that could be competitive for water splitting in acidic media.									43	3	0	0	2	0	44			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000480826900054

C.; Ramakrishnan, Shanmugam; Vijayapradeep, Subramanian; Kim, Ae Rhan; Kim, Jong-Soo; Yoo, Dong Jin								Anion dependency of spinel type cobalt catalysts for efficient overall water splitting in an acid medium								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				451						138471	10.1016/j.cej.2022.138471				JAN 1 2023	2023	Developing effective electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an important task in sustainable water splitting for manufacturing green hydrogen. In the present study, we report a bifunctional catalyst prepared with an easy and cost-effective synthesis method for designing a spinel-structured, cobalt-based, and carbon-supported electrocatalyst (Co3O4@rGO and Co3S4@rGO). X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals that Co-O and Co-S bonds are formed at the edge between cations and anions in the Co3O4, Co3S4 on the surface of reduced graphene oxide, which can alter the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Fabricated Co3S4@rGO nanostructure catalysts showed best catalytic activity toward HER (n(10): 151 mV) and OER (n(10): 350 mV) comparable to those of commercial Pt-C and IrO2, respectively. This showed a significant improvement of water splitting performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte as compared to Co3O4@rGO electrocatalyst, with an operating voltage of 1.82 V at a current density 10 mA cm(-2). These spinel cobalt electrocatalysts greatly enhanced the water splitting performance depending on the choice of anion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000862701600005

Herein, Ni5Mo/NiCo2O4 heterojunctions loaded on nickel foam were prepared. The catalyst shows excellent bifunctional activity, with an HER overpotential of 44mV at 10mA cm(-2) and an OER overpotential of 305mV at 50mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte. In addition, it is worth noting that the overpotential of HER and OER at 500mA cm(-2) are only 229 mV and 368 mV, respectively. It is evidenced that the combination of Ni5Mo and NiCo2O4 transfers electrons from Co2+/Co3+ to Ni-0/Mo-0, which optimizes the electronic structures of the active sites of Ni-0, Mo-0 and Co3+, thus greatly enhances the intrinsic HER and OER activities. When Ni5Mo/NiCo2O4/NF is used as anode and cathode for water splitting under alkaline conditions, a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.54 V and a long-term stability up to 50 h. This work highlights the synergy effect of alloy and oxide heterojunctions in efficient water electrocatalysis.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2468-8231			WOS:000789318800007

Driven by renewable energy sources such as solar energy and wind energy, hydrogen generation from water electrolysis is expected to truly achieve the goal of carbon neutrality, among which direct splitting of seawater is of increasing signif-icance since the naturally abundant feedstock. With a typical overall salinity reaching & SIM;3.5 wt% and a pH around 8, the challenges of seawater electrolysis lie not only in the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER), but also in the competition of chloride-ions oxidation reaction (CER). In this review, an overview of the latest developments in seawater splitting was outlined. Firstly, the challenges inhabiting the progress in seawater electrolysis such as detrimental chlorine evolution reaction and unfavorable insoluble precipitates formation were pictured, followed by a brief introduction to the state-of-the-art advances in water electrolysis. Next, a framework that was expected to realize the large-scale industrialization of seawater electrolysis was described based on several effective strategies for seawater decomposition. Benefiting from the efficiently tun-able structure-activity relationship, OER electrocatalysts in the seawater-splitting scenario will bring wide-spread prosperity to the hydrogen economy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000870699900006

Results show that additional amalgamation of Ni along with the open-pore architecture of Ni/NiO significantly improves the conductivity and offers additional active sites, which in combination, facilitate the charge transfer, lower the onset OER potential, improve the reaction kinetics and increase the overall turnover frequency during the electrocatalytic OER. The chemical and microstructural modification of Ni/NiO also stimulates the poisoning-resistant behaviour and electromechanical stability of the material, during the electrocatalytic OER for longer duration. Significant current and potential oscillations are observed in the "i vs. t" and "V vs. t" plots, from where a major mechanistic conclusion is drawn regarding the very fast OER kinetics and the poisoning-resilient behaviour of Ni/NiO against (-OH and -O)(ads), during the electrocatalytic OER. The presented approach can be a reference for the future design of all non-noble metal OER electrocatalysts, towards application in ultra-efficient energy conversion and storage devices based on oxygen electrochemistry.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000580644700036

Till date, however, their OER performance is far from satisfactory in terms of both activity and stability due to low amount of active sites and a severe aggregation/restacking effect. Herein, we developed the in situ growth of nitrogen-doped, oxygen-functionalized and edge/defect-rich vertically aligned graphene nanosheets on the surface of a carbon cloth (N, O-VAGNs/CC). The separate graphene nanosheets fixed to the surface of the carbon cloth could effectively avoid aggregation. In addition, the vertically aligned morphology provides a highly superficial area and open space, resulting in maximally exposed active sites and unhindered gas transport. Moreover, compared with undoped graphene, the N, O-VAGNs/CC possesses numerous functional groups, abundant defects and active-edges, which are favorable to OER activity. Impressively, this graphene design drastically enhanced OER activity with an overpotential of 351 mV and a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution, which is superior even to the state-of-the-art RuO2 electrocatalysts, indicating remarkable stability and durability in alkaline media. This study may provide an insight into the design and fabrication of alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts for the design and fabrication of alternatives to noble metal-based catalysts for the OER.									48	2	0	0	1	0	49			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000423981200030

Theelectrocatalyst is synthesized through a hydrothermal-calcinationmethod of adding graphene oxide using ZIF-67 as a templatefollowed by an annealing process in the presence of NaH2PO4middotH2O. In the designed electrocatalyst, the formed hollow nano-particles had an average diameter of 100 nm. The synthesizedelectrocatalyst displays a hydrogen evolution reaction overpotentialof 54 mV at 10 mA cm-2current density in 0.5 mol L-1H2SO4solution at room temperature, comparable to Pt/C catalysts. Theoxygen evolution reaction overpotential in 1 mol L-1KOHelectrolyte is 288 mV, which is almost equivalent to that of IrO2.Stated thus, the as-prepared composite catalysts are promising candidates for bifunctional catalysts for water splitting technology,relieving the limitation of commercial catalysts caused by their single catalytic performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000793737800031

Here, some basic principles of semiconductor photoelectrochemistry are reviewed with particular emphasis on the effects of slow interfacial electron transfer at n-type semiconductors in the case of light-driven oxygen evolution. A simple kinetic model is outlined that considers the competition between interfacial transfer of photogenerated holes and surface recombination. The model shows that, if interfacial charge transfer is very slow, the build-up of holes at the surface will lead to substantial changes in the potential drop across the Helmholtz layer, leading to non-ideal behavior (Fermi level pinning). The kinetic model is also used to predict the response of photoanodes to chopped illumination and to periodic perturbations of illumination and potential. Recent experimental results obtained for alpha-Fe2O3 (hematite) photoanodes are reviewed and interpreted within the framework of the model.									171	4	0	0	10	0	172			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000313800200005

Coupling TMPs with carbon materials can increase OER activity by improving the dispersion of active sites and introducing more OER-active species. However, the overwhelming majority of previous works have used either ex-situ methods to prepare TMPs@carbon hybrids or have obtained TMPs@ disordered carbons. Here, we report an in-situ synthesized TMPs coupled with carbon tubes as an active OER catalyst. Bimetallic NiFe phosphide (Ni2-xFexP) coupled with N/P co-doped carbon tubes (NPC), i.e., Ni2-xFexP@NPC, is prepared by pyrolyzing phytic acid sodium salt hydrate, melamine, and transition metal nitrate. Bimetallic NiFeP@NPC is found more active in catalyzing OER compared to monometallic Ni2P@NPC and Fe2P@NPC, metal-free NPC, and NiFeP@P-doped disordered carbon (NiFeP@PC). Its high performance is attributed to the unique tubular structure of its carbon material and the addition of a second metal into binary TMPs, contributing to a larger electrochemical active surface area and faster charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, NiFeP@NPC exceeds the benchmark RuO2 in terms of the OER activity, and it exhibits little activity degradation in both accelerated aging and chronopotentiometric tests, demonstrating a great promise as a high-performance OER electrocatalyst.									93	5	0	0	8	0	94			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500029		
J	El-Deab, Mohamed S.; Kitamura, Fusao; Ohsaka, Takeo					El-Deab, Mohamed/0000-0001-9089-3399			Impact of acrylonitrile poisoning on oxygen reduction reaction at Pt/C catalysts								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				229				65	71		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.11.100				MAY 1 2013	2013	This study addresses the poisoning effect of acrylonitrile (AcN) on the catalytic activity of a Pt/C catalyst modified GC disk electrode toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in O-2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. A significant retarding effect of AcN on the catalytic performance of the Pt/C catalyst toward the ORR is observed. For instance, the presence of 1 ppm AcN in solution causes a cathodic shift of the half-wave potential of the ORR by ca. 85 mV with the formation of hydrogen peroxide (2-electron reduction product of O-2). Similar Tafel slopes (close to -68 mV dec(-1)) are obtained at the unpoisoned and the poisoned Pt/C catalysts at low current density region. Whereas, a larger Tafel slope (ca. -228 mV dec(-1)) is observed at the poisoned catalyst than that obtained at the unpoisoned Pt/C catalyst (ca. -128 mV dec(-1)) at high current density region. The adsorption of AcN on the surface of the Pt/C is believed to alter its work function (Phi) in such a way that deteriorates its catalytic activity. The recovery of the performance of the Pt/C catalyst is achieved by employing a few potential cycles between the onset potentials of the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reactions.

In this paper, metal organic layer (MOL) derived Co/Co9S8 nanoparticles coated with N,S co-doped graphene-like carbon nanosheets were synthesized with the help of the space-confinement effect of montmorillonite (MMT). The as-prepared material shows excellent electrocatalytic activity both for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions in 0.1 M KOH solution: its ORR onset potential is 0.93 V (vs. RHE) and the limiting diffusion current density is 4.7 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the retention of current for the as-prepared material is 85% after a stability test for 10 000 s for the ORR, while those of the template free catalyst and commercial Pt/C glided below 80%. Additionally, its Tafel slope is 265 mV dec(-1), which is much smaller than that of the control sample, suggesting the excellent OER kinetics. The excellent catalytic activity and stability can be attributed to the relatively higher specific surface area, higher number of pyridinic-N and Co-N-x active sites, and higher graphitization degree compared to the template free catalyst.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000540929200045

Oxygen did not evolve if limonite was added to hydrogen peroxide frozen at a temperature of dry ice. However, at room temperature, a vigorous chemical reaction occurred and a large amount of oxygen evolved. Apparently, the ground of Mars contains not only hydrated iron oxides but also frozen hydrogen peroxide whose thawing in the incubation chamber of Viking resulted in its catalytic degradation under the action of iron ions. The evidence thus obtained and its comparison with the data of American scientists account for considerable evolution of oxygen detected by Viking upon analysis of the Mars ground.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			0026-3656			MEDLINE:703649	703649

The Ni3Fe alloy nanostructured framework provides large electroactive surface area and accelerates the charge transport, while the Ni3Fe-(OH)(9) nanoshell allows an excellent electrochemical accessibility and high catalytic activity. When acting as an anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the hybrid catalyst is characterized by a low onset potential (eta(onset) = 230 mV), small Tafel slope (28 mV/dec), and stable catalytic activity (over 24 h). More importantly, the hybrid can act as an excellent bifunctional catalyst and deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.63 V with long stability in a symmetric alkaline electrolyzer for overall water electrolysis.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000458705200011

In this study, carbon hollow spheres with highly dispersed nitrogen and phosphorus co-coordinated iron atoms (FeNPC) on their surface have been successfully fabricated, exhibiting exceptional ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic solutions. Specifically, the obtained FeNPC catalyst is capable of catalyzing the ORR with an onset potential of 1.03 V and a half-wave potential of 0.88 V (both vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline solution, outperforming the commercial Pt/C catalyst under identical conditions. Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that the quasi-octahedral O-2-FeNxPy species are the active sites of the FeNPC composite. These species modify the electronic configuration of Fe centers and weaken the adsorption of the OH* intermediate, thereby promoting the ORR process. Additionally, the FeNPC catalyst also displays a catalytic activity towards the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), making it an active air electrode catalyst in rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a high peak power density of 233.2 mW cm(-2) and an excellent cycling stability at 3 mA cm(-2) for over 15 h.									57	3	0	0	3	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000474712700035

Nevertheless, the development of highly-active bifunctional catalysts at low cost for both ORR and OER still remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report a new N-doped graphene/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) hybrid (NGSH) material as an efficient noble-metal-free bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. NGSHs were fabricated by in situ doping during chemical vapor deposition growth on layered double hydroxide derived bifunctional catalysts. Our one-step approach not only provides simultaneous growth of graphene and SWCNTs, leading to the formation of three dimensional interconnected network, but also brings the intrinsic dispersion of graphene and carbon nanotubes and the dispersion of N-containing functional groups within a highly conductive scaffold. Thus, the NGSHs possess a large specific surface area of 812.9 m(2) g(-1) and high electrical conductivity of 53.8 S cm(-1). Despite of relatively low nitrogen content (0.53 at%), the NGSHs demonstrate a high ORR activity, much superior to two constituent components and even comparable to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts with much better durability and resistance to crossover effect. The same hybrid material also presents high catalytic activity towards OER, rendering them high-performance cheap catalysts for both ORR and OER. Our result opens up new avenues for energy conversion technologies based on earth-abundant, scalable, noble-metal-free catalysts.									520	33	0	0	18	0	529			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000337799300013	24574006

Very simply, the metal precursor deposited on the CP was thermally treated by a torch-gun for just 6 s, resulting in the formation of RuO2, Co3O4, and mixed oxide nanoparticles. The material could be directly used as working electrode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with commercial and other state-of-the-art electrocatalysts, the fabricated electrode showed a superior electrocatalytic activity for OER in 1 m HClO4 and 1 m KOH in terms of not only a low overpotential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) but also a high current density at 1.6 V-RHE with satisfying a long-term stability. The novel strategy without requiring time-consuming and uneconomical steps could be expanded to the preparation of various metal oxides on conductive substrates towards diverse electrocatalytic applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000731296700001	34846780

Photosystem two complexes functional for oxygen evolution could be assembled in the methionine and tyrosine mutants up to similar to 15% of wild type levels, whereas no complexes with oxygen evolution activity could be detected in the glutamine mutant. PSII supercomplexes isolated from the tyrosine and methionine mutants were as active as wild type in terms of light-saturated rates of oxygen evolution but in contrast to wild type contained no bound heme despite the presence of the alpha subunit. Oxygen evolution in the tyrosine and methionine mutants was, however, more sensitive to photoinactivation than the WT. Overall, these data establish unambiguously that a redox role for the heme of cytochrome b(559) is not required for photosynthetic oxygen evolution. Instead, our data provide new evidence of a role for cytochrome b(559) in the protection. of the photosystem two complex in vivo.									23	3	0	0	20	0	25			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000170613500071	11390403

Here, we provide a robust CoO/CoSe2 hybrid electrocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction in a wider pH limits through an effective in situ partial surface-oxidation-selenization route. The purpose and ideas of the design are elaborated by the clever use of the process of partial transforming MOFs to LDHs, in situ growing ZnCo-LDHs on the surface of ZIF-8, increasing the number of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of MOFs to achieve more Co and subsequent CoO, and constructing CoO/CoSe2 heterostructure materials by further selenization. More importantly, the CoO/CoSe2 nanoparticles is encapsulated with in-situ grown nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon shell and embedded in N, Se co-doped carbon network. Owing to the well-designed nanostructure and the synergistic effect from CoO and CoSe2, this hybrid electrocatalyst show substantially enhanced activity and improved longterm durability beyond CoO under both acid and alkaline conditions. This research work may pave a new avenue for the design of universal CoO-based electrocatalysts and their application in clean energy related fields.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000662997500007

Herein, we demonstrate an in situ surface modification strategy for alpha and beta-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets to boost their OER activities via a simple substitution of their surface hydroxyl functional groups by carboxylate or acetic anhydridate ones, respectively. This in situ surface modification can increase the areal densities of active sites and reduce the OER energy barriers while maintaining initial structure and morphology. Experimental results show that the modified catalysts can present much larger electrochemical active surface area (ECSA) and lower OER onset overpotential in comparison with the fresh ones. In case of carboxylate-modified alpha-Co(OH)(2) nanosheets, the onset overpotential has decreased from 266 to 233 mV and the required overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) has decreased from 309 to 288 mV on glassy carbon electrode. Density of states (DOS) calculations reveal an optimized adsorption energy of reaction intermediates. Remarkably, tuning surface electronic structure of catalyst by appropriately choosing highly electronegative functional groups can be considered as an efficient approach to enhance its OER activity.									17	3	0	0	0	0	17			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000534223100020

Herein, we developed an approach to regulate the morphology and electronic structure of -Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)(x) nanoplates, in which FeCl2 (as a precursor) plays a significant role under reflux conditions. The resulting 2D -Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)(x) nanoplates exhibit more accessible edge active sites and more high-valence Co species to boost its intrinsic activity. Therefore, this electrocatalyst shows outstanding oxygen evolution reaction performance (with an overpotential of 225mV at 10mAcm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 39mVdec(-1) and good stability) and excellent activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (with an overpotential of 122mV at 10mAcm(-2)) in 1M KOH solution. When employed as bifunctional electrocatalysts on both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, -Co0.9Fe0.1(OH)(x) can afford 10mAcm(-2) at 1.62V with long-term stability. The one-pot synthesis of 2D Fe-doped transition-metal hydroxide nanoplates enriched with abundant edge sites may provide a new strategy for fabricating efficient overall water splitting catalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000471342200007

Herein, we report an electrochemically deposited mixed Cu-Co-P film, as a bifunctional catalyst with high stability and activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, in 1 M KOH). In alkaline medium, the Cu-Co-P catalyst outperforms the state-of-art catalysts for both HER (Pt) and OER (RuO2) and is stable under continuous electrolysis for up to 72 hours. Using Cu-Co-P electrodes as both the anode and the cathode increases the activity by similar to 2.5 times greater than the integrated performance of RuO2 (anode) and Pt (cathode) at 1.9 V. The competent bifunctionality of Cu-Co-P is facilitated by Cu incorporation, leading to a low surface passivation of the electrode. This study offers a new strategy to develop earth abundant bimetallic phosphides, which are potential catalysts for many alternative energy technologies.									42	2	0	0	2	0	43			2168-0485			WOS:000458086100027

Herein, we present a fast and simple method of synthesizing iron-doped amorphous nickel boride on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. The hybrid exhibits outstanding OER performance and stability in prolonged OER operation. In 1.0 M KOH, only 230 mV is required to afford a current density of 15 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). DFT calculations lead to a suggestion that the in situ formation of MOxHy during electrochemical activation acts as active sites for water oxidation. The superior OER activity of the as-prepared catalyst is attributed to (i) its unique amorphous structure to allow abundant active sites, (ii) synergistic effect of constituents, and (iii) strong coupling of active material and highly conductive rGO. This work not only provides new perspectives to design a highly effective material for OER but also opens a promising avenue to tailor the electrochemical properties of metal borides, which could be extended to other materials for energy storage and conversion technologies.									49	2	0	0	3	0	50			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000455561200089	30520625

The emphasize is put on the spinel and perovskite families. The properties of the oxides depend on the preparation procedure. Some methods of preparation of powders and films of mixed oxides are briefly presented : thermal decomposition of salts, freeze drying, spray pyrolysis, sol-gel, sputtering and electrochemical. Characterization of the products by X-ray diffractometry is not sufficient. Surface optical methods like, for instance, near grazing X-ray diffraction are useful with very thin films, together with UV-vis-NIR reflectance spectroscopy for their identification. Transmission and/or reflexion IRFT spectroscopy is also useful, as the thickness detection lower limit can be as low as 5 nm in the best case with this technique. Optical spectra of Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 are presented. The knowledge of the cationic distribution in the mixed oxide is essential to a better understanding of the electrocatalytic properties. Cyclic voltammetry provides an electrochemical mean of characterization of the oxide/solution interface. A double electrode flow through cell has been designed to investigate the ORR on films and to determine the ratio of the direct reduction rate constant (k1) to the indirect (peroxide) reduction rate constant (k2). This will be exemplified with the copper manganite spinel Cu1+xMn2-xO4 on which k1/k2 increases from 2 to 9 when x increases from 0.2 to 0.4.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1155-4339			WOS:A1994ND95000007

In this work, based on computational screening over doping of 23 kinds of transition metals (TMs), we use first-principles study to explore the ORR and OER activity of TM-N(4)embedded black phosphorus carbide monolayer (b-PC). The results show that its catalytic performance highly depends on the number of electrons in the d orbital and the number of valence electrons of introduced TM atom. Moreover, we found that Co-N-4-bPC (eta(ORR)= 0.31 V;eta(OER)= 0.22 V), Rh-N-4-bPC (eta(ORR)= 0.33 V;eta(OER)= 0.62 V), and Ir-N-4-bPC (eta(ORR)= 0.21 V;eta(OER)= 0.21 V) can be promising candidates as bifunctional catalysts for both the ORR and OER and can be comparable or superior to TM-N-4-graphene in terms of overpotential. They experience no structural distortion at 500 K. Moreover, the exfoliation energy of b-PC is lower than that of graphene, and these three promising candidates show much lower formation energy than TM-N-4-graphene. Our study provides a systematical method for designing and developing high performance 2D material-based single atom catalysts (SACs) beyond graphene.									15	0	0	0	0	0	14			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000572677500017	32896844

With several decades of research, the scientific community still encounters great academic and technological challenges to efficiently generate hydrogen from water with sunlight at large scale and low cost. Recent developments based on novel system designs have led to significant advances in the fundamental understanding of light-induced charge dynamics and related interfacial chemical reactions and efficiencies. This Review provides a thorough overview of the very recent progress in new materials and photoelectrochemical system designs, surface engineering strategies, and efficient new cocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) as well as advanced spectroscopic studies related to photogenerated charge dynamics and interfacial electronic structure. A focus is given on newly developed strategies to improve the rate-determining steps, as well as emerging approaches for surface modifications, surface reaction dynamics, and optimal device structure design from a charge transfer viewpoint. Finally, a promising new system is being proposed and described, derived from the overall understanding, mechanisms, and concepts reported in the literature for efficient and stable water splitting systems.									147	7	0	0	16	1	148			2380-8195			WOS:000389617700022

Herein, a facile strategy is demonstrated to synthesize OER active CoSn(OH)(6)/g-C3N4 (CS/gCN) nanocomposite at room temperature. Among the prepared composites of different compositions, CS/gCN100 composite with similar to 37 wt% gCN as confirmed by thermo gravimetric analysis exhibits a good OER activity with an overpotential of 336 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which is better than the commercial available standard IrO2. The improved OER activity of CS/gCN100 of similar materials is ascribed to high specific surface area (107 m(2) g(-1)), high electrochemical active surface area (4.55 cm(2)) and low charge transfer resistance (6.26 Omega) due to the synergistic effect of g-C3N4 and OER active CoSn(OH)(6). The OER activity of CS/gCN100 is further demonstrated by fabricating a two-electrode system with Pt/C as hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst for water splitting in an alkaline medium. The two-electrode system delivers an overall voltage of 1.66 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) with excellent durability for water splitting application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000868571900003

We report that bimetallic nickel-platinum/cobalt-iridium two-dimensional (2D) nanoframes provide significantly higher ORR and OER activities compared with platinum-iridium oxide (Pt-IrO2). The metallic alloy 2D nanoframes (NiPt and CoIr) were synthesized by thermal reduction of noble-metal-decorated transition-metal hydroxide nanosheets followed by chemical leaching. The 2D nanoframes utilize noble metal (Pt, Ir)-non-noble metal (Ni, Co) interactions to alter the atomic structure, and the unsupported nanostructure provides a carbon-free matrix with three-dimensional (3D) accessibility to the catalytically active sites. Within the cyclic voltammograms, hydrogen adsorption/desorption features on Pt were suppressed within Pt-IrO2 but were clearly observed within NiPt-CoIr which is attributed to the different size and shape of the nanoframes relative to Pt and IrO2 that result in less interparticle interaction within NiPt-CoIr compared with commercial Pt-IrO2. Rotating disk electrode testing showed that the 2D nanoframe bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts showed significantly higher ORR mass activity, OER mass activity, and round-trip efficiency compared with Pt-IrO2. Over repeated mode switching between ORR and OER potential ranges using an accelerated durability testing protocol, the NiPt-CoIr 2D nanoframe electrocatalysts showed lower ORR stability but improved OER stability compared with Pt-IrO2. Bimetallic 3D structures with controlled size, shape, surface structure, and morphology provide the opportunity to design bifunctional catalysts with improved activity and stability.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300042

As such, the rational design and facile synthesis of bimetallic-based phosphides with well-controlled architectures and compositions is of scientific and technological importance. In this work, Fe-Co Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanocones (NCs) have been successfully fabricated via an intercalation reaction strategy by utilizing layer structured alpha-Co(OH)(2) NCs as self-sacrificing templates. After calcination and phosphorization process, Fe-Co PBA NCs can be converted to Fe-doped CoRP NCs without obvious shrinkage. Electrochemical tests show that Fe incorporation can effectively promote the electrocatalytic activities of CoxP. This simple and effective method will be of benefit for the development of other functional Co-based bimetallic compounds. Furthermore, this strategy can possibly be extended to fabricate a series of PBA materials with special structure and novel morphology, which can serve as a promising platform for diverse applications, especially in energy storage and conversion.									31	4	0	0	0	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500011

However, current fabrication methods for Mn3O4 octahedrons generally produce particles of micron and sub-micron sizes, and impurities such as MnO2 and Mn3O4 are often found. We present the synthesis of Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons with a pure Mn3O4 phase and size down to 50 nm based on a hydrothermal method using Mn(NO3)(2) as the manganese source and ethylenediamine (EDA) as the structure-mediating agent. It is found that EDA plays a crucial role in the formation of Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons in regulating both the morphology and the crystal structure of the products. The growth process is proposed to follow a "dissolution-recrystallization" and "cappingmolecule assisted growth" mechanism. As electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction, the 50 nm Mn3O4 nano-octahedrons demonstrate a considerably enhanced activity compared to 160 nm Mn3O4 octahedrons.									28	0	0	0	2	0	28			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000341020700062	25117715

Herein, the incorporation of a plasmonic silver cathode as an advanced strategy to promote ORR and OER kinetics due to strong local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is introduced. Chronoamperometry results revealed that the highly energetic electrons and holes excited by LSPR of silver nanostructure facilitated ORR and OER kinetics ascribe to the emission of hot carriers in femtosecond time scale. Furthermore, a relatively rare discharge voltage 3.1 V is obtained, correspondingly, the charge plateau also decline to 3.3 V, the energy efficiency of Li-O-2 battery by a 23% increase in comparison with a commercial 5% Pt/C catalyst (discharge and charge plateau of 2.75 and 3.61 V). Additionally, the improvement in the efficient charge transfer manner result in a reversible spherical Li2O2 which further improve the ORR and OER kinetics. The LSPR strategy represents a critical step toward developing fast kinetics and high energy efficiency Li-O-2 batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000662086600052	34056904

However, the majority of the previously reported flexible Zn-air batteries encounter problems such as sluggish oxygen reaction kinetics, inferior long-term durability, and poor flexibility induced by the rigid nature of the air cathode, all of which severely hinder their practical applications. Herein, a defect-enriched nitrogen doped-graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) engineered 3D NiCo2S4 nanoarray is developed by a facile chemical sulfuration and subsequent electrophoretic deposition process. The as-fabricated N-GQDs/NiCo2S4 nanoarray grown on carbon cloth as a flexible air cathode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activities toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outstanding cycle stability (200 h at 20 mA cm(-2)), and excellent mechanical flexibility (without observable decay under various bending angles). These impressive enhancements in electrocatalytic performance are mainly attributed to bifunctional active sites within the N-GQDs/NiCo2S4 catalyst and synergistic coupling effects between N-GQDs and NiCo2S4. Density functional theory analysis further reveals that stronger OOH* dissociation adsorption at the interface between N-GQDs and NiCo2S4 lowers the overpotential of both ORR and OER.									67	5	0	0	1	0	68			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000485785400001	31512394

Various analytical techniques such as powder XRD, TEM, HRTEM, EDS, SEM/EDAX and XPS were used to characterize the synthesized nanocomposite. TEM and SEM image shows the morphology of Cu@CuFe2O4 nanocomposite which is spherical in shape and dimensions of diameter is in the range of 88 - 150 nm and 42-114.28 nm, respectively. The peaks corresponding to Cu, Fe and O in Cu@CuFe2O4 nanocomposite were observed in XPS data as well as in EDAX analysis. The electrochemical analysis was conducted for OER by cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Current density as high as 16.5 mA.cm(-2) at over-potential 1.4 V (vs Ag/AgCl) indicated excellent oxygen generation. The results revealed that the synthesized nanocomposite is an efficient catalyst for production of oxygen.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2666-5239			WOS:000739374600013

In addition, CoS/N/S/rGO showed obvious four-electron transfer characteristics and ultra-low hydrogen peroxide production rate.

Here, we demonstrated the efficient and facile hydrogen peroxide-assisted hydrothermal reforming of melamine to synthesize a new oxygen (O)-doped precursor that was then transferred to O-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets, with an increased conductive band edge compared to bulk g-C3N4, via direct thermal polymerization. Owing to synergistic interaction between the 2D ultrathin nanosheet structure with large surface area and the enhanced conductive band edge caused by appropriate oxygen doping, the as-synthesized O-doped g-C3N4 nanosheets showed highly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, about 10.7 times higher than pristine C3N4 under visible light irradiation, achieving an apparent quantum yield of 13.04% at 420 nm. Significantly, this precursor pre-doping strategy might provide a promising pathway for preparing heteroatom-doped g-C3N4.									34	3	0	0	4	0	34			2052-1553			WOS:000438238300030

Herein we propose a modified triple conducting (H+/O2-/e(-)) steam (air) electrode through the infiltration of an Sm0.2Ce0.8O2-delta (SDC) oxygen-ionic conductor, because the polarization resistance (R-p) of P-RSOCs mainly comes from the steam (air) electrode in both the operational modes. The SDC-infiltrated nanoparticles on the composite BaCo0.4Zr0.1Fe0.4Y0.1O3+delta (BCZFY)-BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.2-xYbxO3-delta (BCZYYb) electrode result in a considerable improvement in the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity at 600-700 degrees C due to the extension of electrochemical active sites with the increasing of surface area. In addition, the enhanced ionic conduction of a triple conducting composite using infiltrated oxygen-ionic SDC conductors leads to an effective decrease in the R-p (1.388 -> 1.079 Omega.cm(2) at 600 degrees C symmetric cell) with improved cell performance in both the PCFC and PCEC modes. Furthermore, the NiO-BCZYYb anode-supported cell with the SDC-infiltrated composite BCZFY-BCZYYb air electrode shows excellent durability in the PCFC and PCEC modes without any degradation during 250 h each at 650 degrees C.

Here we present the electrocapillarity behavior (in situ surface stress evolution) of Pt{111} and Au{111} electrodes. We relate the magnitude and anodic/cathodic hysteresis of the stress-potential behavior to the potential dependent water orientation at the electrode/electrolyte interface. We show that our results are strongly correlated to previously published infrared spectroscopy data on the potential dependence of interphase structure. Finally, measurements of Pt in oxygen saturated electrolytes are presented, allowing for a direct comparison between features in the surface stress behavior and the "turn-on" potential for oxygen reduction. We found that oxygen reduction occurs only once the potential was cathodic enough to begin depleting the interface of oxygen-down oriented water.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000249838300025

While nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) are emerging as prominent candidates with promising OER activity, their catalytic performance is still restricted by the limited active sites, poor conductivity and durability. Herein, hierarchical nickel-iron-cobalt LDH nanosheets/carbon fibers (NiFeCo-LDH/CF) are synthesized through solvent-thermal treatment of ZIF-67/CF. Extended X-ray adsorption fine structure analyses reveal that the Co substitution can stabilize the Fe local coordination environment and facilitate the pi-symmetry bonding orbital in NiFeCo-LDH/CF, thus modifying the electronic structures. Coupling with the structural advantages, including the largely exposed active surface sites and facilitated charge transfer pathway ensured by CF, the resultant NiFeCo-LDH/CF exhibits excellent OER activity with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-1)as well as robust stability over 20 h.									122	2	0	0	8	0	122			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000561043200001	32820607

Oxygen can react with all food components: lipids, proteins, sugars, and vitamins. To imagine new strategies of protection of food, it is necessary to evaluate oxygen transfer and to couple this transfer to chemical reactions. In this work, ascorbic acid oxidation under aerobic conditions has been studied. The objective is to model ascorbic acid degradation regarding both ascorbic acid and oxygen influence, the last one depending on diffusion rate into food and oxygen consumption during reaction. Ascorbic acid degradation was first studied in water under stirring in which oxygen diffusion could be neglected. Experiments were carried out during six days, under six different oxygen contents varying between 0 (simulating packaging in anaerobic conditions) and 21% (simulating packaging in atmospheric conditions) at 8, 14, 20, 27 and 33 degrees C. Thanks to these experiments, kinetic parameters as reaction orders for ascorbic acid and oxygen, kinetics constant and activation energy have been identified. Oxygen sorption kinetics were measured thanks to luminescence oxygen sensors, placed into of a thin layer of agar gels 1% (w/w) exposed to eight successive increasing oxygen content in the atmosphere (from 0% to 21%). The probes measured oxygen content into material as a function of time. Oxygen diffusivity in agar gel was then identified by minimising the sum of square error between experimental results and those predicted by a mathematical model. Finally, using mass balance equation on oxygen and ascorbic acid contents, oxidation reaction and oxygen diffusion in model food systems were modelled. Validation of the model was carried out on agar gels 1% (w/w) enriched in ascorbic acid (1000 mg/l) in which the ascorbic acid content profile was determined by slicing each cylindrical gels in thin layers of 0.5 mm thick and by determining the ascorbic acid content in each layer. Knowing initial ascorbic acid content, oxygen content in atmosphere and temperature, the model can predict evolution of ascorbic acid content in the product as a function of time. This model could be used as a tool to imagine new strategies for protection of interest compounds in food.					6th Chemical Reactions in Food Conferene 20096th Chemical Reactions in Food Conferene 2009	MAY 13-15, 2009MAY 13-15, 2009	Inst Chem Technol, Dept Food Chem & Anal; Food Res Inst Prague; Czech Chem Soc, Div Food & Agr Chem; Czech Technol Platform Foodstuffs; European Assoc Chemical & Mole Sci Food Chem DivInst Chem Technol, Dept Food Chem & Anal; Food Res Inst Prague; Czech Chem Soc, Div Food & Agr Chem; Czech Technol Platform Foodstuffs; European Assoc Chemical & Mole Sci Food Chem Div	Prague, CZECH REPUBLICPrague, CZECH REPUBLIC	2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1212-1800			WOS:000269005600010

This includes the widely studied electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is often accompanied by anodic currents associated with the activation or degradation of the catalyst and/or support. Herein, we use an online chip-based electrochemistry-mass spectrometry (chip EC-MS) system to decouple the OER from the complex electrochemical reactions for a graphene-supported ruthenium (Ru) catalyst with high OER activity in an acidic medium. In this manner, we can quantitatively evaluate the current contribution from the OER during cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests and chronopotentiometry (CP) tests and are thus enabled to realize the accurate measurement of the onset potential and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward the OER. The OER process, including the activation, steady-state, and degradation processes, as well as the side reaction, is also studied using such a chip EC-MS technique. This work is of practical importance to clarify some critical issues remaining in the study of OER electrocatalysis.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900031

Remarkably, it also shows high catalytical activity and long-time durability for HER both in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and NaCl solution.

The effects of partial substitution of Ca/Ba/Sr in definite stoichiometry on the electrocatalytic behaviour of LaMnO3 have been reported. It has been observed that the oxygen reduction occurs by dissociative chemisorption route on these electrodes at low overpotentials. At higher overpotentials, formation of H2O2 occurs. The electrochemical parameters for the oxygen evolution reaction on these electrocatalysts have been obtained under common alkaline water electrolysis conditions with a view to assess their possible application as anodes. It has been found that the overpotential contribution by the anode to the electrolyser voltage can be reduced by 0.1-0.15 V when compared with the conventional nickel anodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-1654			WOS:A1993RA87600003

The soft carburization conditions of this method allow the preparation of nanoparticulate Mo2C even with a high Mo loading (50 wt.%). The catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction was analyzed both in an electrochemical cell at various pH and in a laboratory-scale electrolyzes. These nanoparticles were found to be very active in catalyzing hydrogen evolution reaction in acidic media and appeared to promote kinetics leaning toward the Volmer-Heyrovskji mechanism at low pH. Moreover, the Mo2C/C catalyst was shown to be suitable for hydrogen production in a laboratory-scale electrolysis cell, retaining its performance during a four-week durability experiment. Thus this study implies that the investigated Mo2C/C electrocatalyst is a promising alternative to platinum as a cathode material for electrolytic hydrogen production because of its favorable kinetics and stability.

Herein, we demonstrate a hybrid composed of CeO2-decorated Co nanoparticles supported on three-dimensionally porous carbon aerogels (Co-CeO2/C aerogels) as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst. The preparation of Co-CeO2/C aerogels depends on the formation of a novel CeCl3/K3Co(CN)(6)-chitosan (CS) hydrogel, during which the cyanide groups of K3Co(CN)(6) combines the hydroxyls in CS by hydrogen bridges, accompanying with the substitution of chloride groups in CeCl3 by cyanide groups in K3Co(CN)(6). The electron spin resonance offers a convincing proof that numerous oxygen vacancies were found in Co-CeO2/C aerogels after the introduction of CeO2. The developed Co-CeO2/C aerogels showed an outstanding electrochemical performance for both OER and ORR in comparsion with RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts in 0.1 M KOH solution. A small overpotential (380 mV) and a low Tafel slope (99 mV dec(-1)) were observed for OER, while the half-wave potential (0.75 V) and the onset potential (0.92 V) were high for ORR. The superior performance could be put down to the multihole heterostructure, multiple components and abundant oxygen vacancies. It was very helpful for the adsorption and the catalyzation of the reactants and the efficient mass transport of reagent/product. This work paves a neoteric method to synthesize a bifunctional hybrid catalyst with a highly efficient performance of energy conversion and storage.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000745103200001	35060989

J	Liu, Huibing; Yang, Liu; Qiao, Kangwei; Zheng, Lirong; Cao, Xiaohua; Cao, Dapeng								Amorphous Cobalt Iron Borate Grown on Carbon Paper as a Precatalyst for Water Oxidation								CHEMSUSCHEM				12	15			3524	3531		10.1002/cssc.201901327				AUG 8 2019	2019	The key to improving water oxidation is to develop efficient and earth-abundant catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a new amorphous cobalt iron borate supported on 3D carbon paper integrated electrode is reported as a precatalyst for the OER, which was synthesized by using a one-pot hydrothermal method. An optimum OER activity was obtained at 25 % Fe doping by screening the compositions of the Co and Fe. The best synthesized catalyst needs an overpotential of 227 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and also exhibits a long-term durability of 24 h. Impressively, we find that CoFe oxyhydroxide was formed in situ in the OER process, which serves as the real catalytic active species for OER. Moreover, the direct conversion from CoFe borate to CoFe oxyhydroxide is reported for the first time in metal borate OER catalysts. The discovery in this work, that is, that metal borate as a precursor can efficiently catalyze the OER in alkaline media, significantly widens the family of OER catalysts.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000479276700013	31134757

However, the slow OER kinetics and the poor environmental stability of BP seriously limits its overall OER performance and prevents its electrocatalysis application. Here, sulfur (S)-doped BP nanosheets, which are prepared using high-pressure synthesis followed by liquid exfoliation, have been demonstrated to have much better OER electrocatalytic activity and environmental stability compared to their undoped counterparts. The S-doped BP nanosheets display a Tafel slope of 75 mV dec(-1), which is a favorable value refered to the kinetics of OER in electrochemical tests. Notably, there is no degradation of S-doped BP nanosheets after six days exposure to ambient, indicating an excellent environmental stability of the S-doped BP. The density functional theory calculations show that the OER activity of BP originate from its crystal defects and heteroatom S doping can effectively enhance its OER activity and stability. These results highlight the doping effect on electrocatalytic activities and stability of BP and provide a simple and effective method to design highly efficient OER catalysts based on the modification of BP.									17	3	0	0	0	0	18			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000450252900001	30418944

Here we demonstrate a facile and universal strategy for fabricating transition metal (TM) sulfides by controlling the atomic ratio of TM precursors for water splitting in basic media. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporation of Fe/Co can significantly improve the catalytic performance. The optimal material exhibits extremely small overpotentials of 208 mV for oxygen evolution and 68 mV for hydrogen evolution at 10 mA cm(-2) with robust long-term stability. The optimized material was used as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, which delivers 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.44 V with robust stability over 80 h at 100 mA cm(-2) without degradation, much better than the combination of Pt and RuO2 as benchmark catalysts. The excellent water-splitting performance sheds light on the promising potential of such sulfides as high activity and robust stable electrodes.									17	3	0	0	0	0	17			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000423140400035	29271192

Herein, we report the in situ growth of porous NiCoSe nanosheet arrays derived from 2D MOFs on Ni foam through a simple ion-exchange reaction followed by a hydrothermal process. Benefiting from the unique 2D multi-porous framework with high electrochemical active surface area, conductivity and open channels for the release of gaseous products, the as-prepared NiCoSe nanosheet arrays exhibit excellent electrochemical activity with a low overpotential of 170 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm(-2) and 278 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 20 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability. Furthermore, the full cell only requires 1.51 V to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) when the NiCoSe nanosheet arrays are used as both anode and cathode, which also exhibits distinguished durability for over 48 h. The present work presents a general strategy for the rational design and synthesis of multifunctional 2D porous electrocatalysts, which is also expected to extend to other noble-metal-free catalysts.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15				1466-8033		WOS:000607726200009

In this work, by means of first-principles computations, we screened a series of transition metal atom anchored C2N monolayers (TMx@C2N, TM = Ti, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, or Au) as electrocatalysts for both HER and OER. Almost all TMx@C2N composites show metallic properties, indicating outstanding charge transfer for efficient electrochemical procedures. Ti-1@C2N, Mn-1@C2N, Co-2@C2N, Ni-2@C2N, Cu-2@C2N, Mo-1@C2N, Ru-2@C2N and Ir-1@C2N exhibit high catalytic activity toward the HER. Among them, Ti-1@C2N would be the best HER catalyst since both N and Ti atoms are active sites. Unfortunately, Ti-1@C2N exhibits no OER activity. Instead, only Mn-1@C2N could perform as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with N and Mn atoms as active sites for the HER and OER, respectively. This work would open a new door for the development of non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and also shed light on C2N-supported nanomaterials as advanced catalysts.									145	10	0	0	2	0	145			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000435829000041

Herein, a novel core-shell composition of Co9S8/Co embedded multi-channel carbon nanofiber was successfully developed as efficient electrocatalysts for ORR and OER by step pyrolysis. The precursor of polystyrene was degraded while polyacrylonitrile was cross-linked to hexatomic ring during the pro-oxidation process, therefore, endowing the longitudinal and parallel channels along the fibers' skeleton in the subsequent carbothermal reduction steps, which affords the superhighway for competent mass transmission and outstanding electrochemical specific area. On the other hand, the potent synergistic effect from precision-designed core-shell species of Co9S8/Co allows the composite multi-channel carbon fiber excellent ORR/OER bifunctional catalytic activities, with a gap of 0.89 V between the half-wave potential toward ORR and potential of OER at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Additionally, the rechargeable Zn-air batteries were capable of operating steadily over 500 discharging/charging cycles at a constant current density of 5 mA/cm(2).									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-0216			WOS:000672035600001

Towards superior OER performance, the wise integration of transition metal compounds with nanocarbon materials is a promising strategy. Herein, a mildly oxidized graphene/single-walled carbon nanotube hybrid was introduced to regulate and control the hybridization of nickel-iron layered double hydroxides into a nanocarbon scaffold. The oxygen functionalities and defects anchored the nucleation and in situ growth of dual-sized layered double hydroxides, leading to a hierarchical porous structure for smooth mass diffusion, intimate interfaces for rapid charge transfer, and efficiently utilized active sites. Attributed to the synergy of individual components and the unique structural features, the as-fabricated composites exhibited superior OER performance with a small onset overpotential (ca. 240 mV), a low overpotential required for 10 mA cm(-2) (ca. 350 mV), and a decreased Tafel slope (ca. 54 mV dec(-1)) in 0.10 M KOH. This work provides a brilliant catalyst for water oxidation and more importantly, opens up new avenues for preparing nanocarbon-based multi-functional composites applicable in heterogeneous catalysis, energy conversion and storage, and so on.									117	16	0	0	7	0	121			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000366163000043

However, previous research into phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has focused on high-temperature vapor-phase processes, which are not practical for large-scale applications. Here, we introduce a simple, one-step solution-phase method of phosphide synthesis by modifying Cu2WS4 using triphenylphosphine (TPP), which serves to substitute S with P and transform the normally inactive basal plane of Cu2WS4 into a defect-rich, activated basal plane. The OER activity was significantly enhanced by phosphorus substitution, with the resulting Tafel slope of the sample with approximate to 8 at% phosphorus reaching 194 mV dec(-1), a result close to that of the best OER catalyst (RuO2, 151 mV dec(-1)). The sample possessed stable OER performance, showing no degradation in current density over approximate to 24 hours (500 cycles), proving the robust and stable nature of the phosphorus substitution. These results open the possibility for further phosphide catalyst development using this low-cost, solution-phase method.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2046-2069			WOS:000455485600030	35521602

Conversely, the H-CoSe(2-x)Px NB can be used for the oxygen evolution reaction in basic media, for which its electrochemical performance is superior to that of a platinum catalyst. When a H-CoSe(2-x)Px NB is used on both sides of a single electrolysis cell, almost no degradation occurs at various constant potentials for 12 h period. Its high performance, electrode stability, and easy synthesis suggest that the H-CoSe(2-x)Px NB is an efficient and economic electrocatalyst for water electrolysis.

The formed 3D nanostructures exhibited excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with a low overpotential of 0.34 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and high durability.

Transition-metal oxides and their derivatives have been explored as OER catalyst candidates owing to their earth-abundant reserves and environment-friendly features. However, their fewer electroactive sites and poor intrinsic activity of active sites greatly limit their catalytic efficiencies. Here, we successfully prepare misfit-layered-structured Bi2Sr2Co2O8+delta (BSCO) nanosheets via liquid exfoliation strategy. We find that the as-exfoliated nanosheets can serve as an efficient electrocatalyst for water oxidation. The single-unit-cell thick BSCO sheets exhibit promoted OER activity with the lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope than the bulk counterpart. The improved performance is ascribed to the increased electrochemical surface areas and the enhanced activity of active sites due to the spin-state transition of cobalt ions at edge sites.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2168-0485			WOS:000443924100136

By studying 30 transition-metal carbides and 30 transition-metal nitrides, Mn+1CnO2 and Mn+1NnO2 (M = Sc, Cr, Hf, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, V, W, Zr; n = 1, 2, 3), the tendency of oxygen desorption after hydrogen adsorption is elucidated to play a key role in HER performance of oxygen-terminated MXenes. On the basis of these observations, we propose a suitable HER descriptor, oxygen vacancy formation energy (E-f), which scales linearly with the adsorption free energy of hydrogen, Delta G(H). In addition, this new descriptor is linearly correlated with the lithium binding strength on oxygen-terminated MXenes. Therefore, E-f is a universal descriptor for identifying the trend of adsorption processes where adsorbed species donate electrons to oxygen-terminated MXenes. This work provides a general guideline for large-scale screening of promising MXene-based materials for energy storage and conversion.									53	4	0	0	2	0	52			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000431088400025

The introduction of activated carbon significantly promotes the catalytic activity of Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER); meanwhile the complete coverage of nanoparticulate Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 onto activated carbon particles prevents the carbon oxidation, leading to improved cycling durability of a zinc-air cell. Scanning electron microscopy images shows a good protective coverage of the nanoparticulate Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 onto the activated carbon particles. Rotating disk electrode voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic results reveal that the OER overpotential and charge-transfer resistance of the Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4 electrocatalyst are substantially lowered by the introduction of activated carbon. With respect to the cycling stability, Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4/1.0 wt%AC and Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4/1.5 wt%AC composites maintain excellent activity for 80 h in a rechargeable zinc-air battery, due to the uniformly protective coverage of metal oxide on activated carbon. Furthermore, the Fe0.1Ni0.9Co2O4/3.7 wt%AC composite was examined in a prolonged rechargeable zinc-air battery test for 120 h and the charge-discharge voltage gap was negligibly enlarged (0.02 V increment after 120 h), which showed their potential as electrocatalysts for long-term energy storage systems.

Life is an expression of increasing order, and a constant influx of energy and loss of entropic wastes are required to maintain or increase order in living organisms. Most of the energy for life comes from sunlight and, thus, photosynthesis underlies the survival of all life forms. Oxygenic photosynthesis determines not only the global amount of enthalpy in living systems, but also the composition of the Earth's atmosphere and surface. Photosynthesis was established on the Earth more than 3.5 billion years ago. The primordial reaction center has been suggested to comprise a homodimeric unit resembling the core complex of the current reaction centers in Chlorobi, Heliobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Here, an evolutionary scenario based on the known structures of the current reaction centers is proposed.									20	0	1	0	17	0	21			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000325848800003	23954951

However, exploring an efficient approach for the systematic production of Pd NCs under similar reaction conditions still presents a significant challenge, which is significantly important to clearly explain the effectiveness of morphology on the catalytic activity of Pd NCs. We designed and accomplished a facile strategy for the morphology transformation between Pd nanosheets and Pd nanotetrahedra by simply controlling the reaction temperature. A growth mechanism was proposed based on TEM images of the time-dependent morphology evolution. The Pd nanosheets and Pd nanotetrahedra exhibit higher activity for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) compared with the benchmark Pd/C catalysts, and their activities are dependent on the morphology. In particular, Pd nanosheets show an increased activity by 3.81 (MOR) and 2.86 (ORR) times due to their large specific surface area and exposed facets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, there are few reports targeted on electrocatalysts by simultaneously employing these two strategies. Herein, theoretical calculation firstly predicts that Ru and V-S can regulate the adsorption energy of OER/HER intermediates for NiCo2S4 electrocatalysts. Then, a facile solvothermal-photochemical strategy is utilized to synthesis series NiCo2S4 samples: through filling the solvothermal-created V-S in NiCo2S4-x with Ru single atoms (Ru-NiCo2S4-x) under ultraviolet irradiation as OER catalysts. Besides, Ru nanoclusters are introduced into NiCo2S4 without V-S (Ru-NiCo2S4) for HER. As a result, the OER exchange current density of NiCo2S4-x is prominently boosted after decoration of Ru single atom, which possesses an eminently low overpotential of 190 mV@50 mA cm(-2), while Ru-NiCo2S4 shows superior HER performance (32 mV@10 mA cm(-2)) compared with Ru-NiCo2S4-x, surpassing most reported electrocatalytic materials. Moreover, Ru-NiCo2S4-x//Ru-NiCo2S4 exhibits remarkable stability and catalytic performance in the overall water splitting, with a cell voltage value of 1.46 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 m KOH. Bader charge analysis unravels the "restricted-delocalized-restricted" phenomenon between electrons promote the electron interactions, which in turn improves electrochemical performance.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000731192100001

However, the scarcity of precious IrO2/RuO2-based metal oxides for oxygen evolution reaction hinders the large-scale utilization. Here, based on the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, we fabricate nanoporous gamma-Ni based solid solution with the simulated FeCoNi surface compositions of Gibeon meteorites by a facile microwave sintering method. A metal (oxy)hydroxide layer with a thickness of approximately 9 nm was formed on the surface of as-prepared electrode after aging, achieving an overpotential of only 254 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 37.0 mV dec(-1). The electrode exhibits outstanding long-term stability in a wide range of current densities without compromising the electrocatalytic activity, which is attributed to the 3D-interconnected nanoporous structure, synergistic effect of different species, high conductivity and excellent wettability. The fabrication of nanoporous non-precious solid solution architectures which mimic naturally-formed materials provides a feasible strategy for the design of high-performance electrocatalysts towards clean energy applications.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626520100008

In this work, two facile chemical treatments, acid leaching and transition metal doping, were shown to modify the chemical and structural properties of low cost and environmentally friendly alpha-MnO2 nanowire catalysts resulting in increased OER activity. Through a combination of XPS and XRD analyses, it was shown that a molten salt treatment of alpha-MnO2 nanowires with Co(NO3)(2) introduced Co2+ ions into the structural tunnels. The introduction of minimal amounts of cobalt (<6 at. %) more than doubled ultimate current densities achieved in linear sweep voltammetry tests. This result was attributed to a reduction of the average oxidation state of manganese in Co-doped samples and a decrease in Tafel slope below 80 mV.dec(-1). Acid leaching, on the other hand, is believed to modify nanowire topography through the creation of oxygen and manganese vacancies, exposing more active sites to participate in catalysis. A characterization approach combining atomic absorption spectroscopy and iodometric titration revealed a 5.1% increase in oxygen vacancies after 72 h of interaction with nitric acid. When these controllable defect formation approaches were applied in tandem, the high activity of the cobalt-doped samples was combined with the increased number of exposed active sites achieved through acid leaching producing a highly efficient electrocatalyst with more than a 3-fold increase in OER activity over pristine alpha-MnO2 nanowires. Our results establish that scalable and easy-to-implement approaches, such as acid leaching and transition metal doping, can lead to more than a three-fold increase in OER activity of low-cost non-toxic manganese oxides. This methodology can be beneficial for other material systems used as OER electrocatalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0277-5387			WOS:000491625700004

The photolysis of water to produce hydrogen requires highly efficient and stable photocatalysts, and the anode used as catalyst for oxygen evolution is a bottleneck in this process. In this paper, the a-TNTAs/Ni2P composite photo-anode was constructed by electrodeposition to anchor the Ni2P cocatalyst for oxygen evolution at the active site of TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs). The a- TNTAs/Ni2P delivered excellent oxygen evolution at a photocurrent density of 1.058 mA cm(2), an improvement of 2.78 times, 13.2 times, and 15.8 times over a-TNTAs, TNTAs/Ni2P, and TNTAs photo-anodes, respectively. The Mott-Schottky curve showed that Ni2P as co-catalyst for oxygen evolution accelerated the rates of separation and transfer of the photogenerated electrons. This research provides a simple and efficient method to promote the OER performance of optical semiconductors. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among 120 candidates with all 3d, 4d, and 5d-block transition metals considered, the inexpensive Fe-based SAC catalyst shows a theoretical overpotential of 5 mV, the lowest value reported to date theoretically or experimentally. With the help of various electronic structural analysis, we reveal that the key to the observed superior HER activity of Fe-based SAC is the enhanced ionicity of bonding between hydrogen and the corresponding SAC and the lack of ensemble effect that causes the *H binding weaker to be nearly at the top of the HER activity volcano.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000446980600034

Herein, we have designed Pt(3)CopC hollow sphere catalysts by the template method, in which PtCo alloy nanoparticles of approximately 3 nm diameter are anchored in a porous shell of nitrogen-doped carbon hollow spheres. Due to the confinement effect of the porous carbon shell, PtCo alloy nanoparticles possess excellent resistance to sintering, maintaining 2-3 nm size after calcination at 800 degrees C. Also, Pt3Co@C hollow sphere catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability in the oxygen reduction reaction, achieving 3.6 times the mass activity of the corresponding commercial Pt/C catalyst. Such catalysts with a mass activity retention rate of 87% after accelerated durability testing and no significant decay in activity after 10,000 potential cycles. Meanwhile, Pt3Co@1 catalysts exhibit extremely high catalytic activity and surprising durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction process over the entire pH range.

However, the structural origin leading to high OER performance of perovskite is not fully understood. Here, we present a strategy of tuning the surface energy density of non-stoichiometric perovskite by creating surface defects in the 3D inverse opal LaCoO3-x (3DIO-LaCoO3-x) through a colloidal template strategy. The defective 3DIO-LaCoO3-x, which has an enhanced surface energy density and a shift in the d-band centre of Co relative to the Fermi level, demonstrates significantly improved intrinsic OER activity, with a TOF (0.21 s(-1)) ten-folder larger than that of conventional LaCoO3 nanoparticles (0.02 s(-1)). The defective surfaces of 3DIO-LaCoO3-x are theoretically proven to alter the rate determining step of OER and significantly reduce the adsorption energies of the intermediate species, resulting in dramatically enhanced OER activity. Moreover, rich surface defects with high electrical conductivity can mitigate structural corrosion by fast transfer of charge through defective conductive channels, and thus enables longterm stability for the defective 3DIO-LaCoO3-x. These results provide an effective approach for enhancing the intrinsic activity of perovskite for water oxidation towards understanding the surface structure engineering for perovskite-based materials.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000589935400008

The Fe3O4 was synthesized in the absence of an inert environment and organic solvent, using a modified coprecipitation procedure. Fe3O4 nanoparticles of average size 15 nm served as the best catalyst support for Co3O4, in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A current density of 10 mA/cm(2) was achieved, at -0.36 and 1.64 V for the HER and OER [versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)], respectively, for the Co3O4/Fe3O4 system, in 0.1 M KOH with low total catalyst loading of 250 mu g/cm(2) (or 100 mu g(Co3O4)/cm(2)). Compared to those using the same total loading of unsupported Co3O4 catalyst, the overpotentials of Co3O4/Fe3O4 catalyst decreased by 0.22 and 0.06 V for the HER and OER, respectively. Despite low nonprecious metal loading, the Co3O4/Fe3O4 system showed high OER kinetics with low Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec. Chronoamperometry tests performed, at 1.62 and -0.30 V for the OER and HER, respectively, on the Co3O4/Fe3O4 catalyst demonstrated extremely stable OER over a period of 8 h. FESEM images of Co3O4/Fe3O4 revealed that the Co3O4 platelets were self-assembled into edge-on orientation on the Fe3O4 support. This largely accounted for the high catalytic activities observed because of the large total exposed surface area of Co3O4/Fe3O4 for catalytic reactions, in addition to electrochemical and morphological effects. Despite negating the need for specially tailored morphologies, Co3O4/Fe3O4 demonstrated enhanced electrochemical performance and stability. This may serve as a cost-effective route to the large-scale commercialization of electrolyzers and fuel cells via facile synthesis of nonprecious metal oxides as the catalyst support system for enhanced electrochemical water electrolysis.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2574-0970			WOS:000461400200044

Dopants endow these nanotubes with high activity as electro-chemical catalysts. Herein, N-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) containing NiFe alloy nanoparticles (NiFe-NCNT) are prepared by calcining a mixture of NiFe Prussian blue analogue (NiFe-PBA) and melamine. MoS(2)nanosheets are then loaded onto NiFe-NCNTviaa hydrothermal process. The resulting MoS2-decorated NiFe-NCNT reveals excellent performance in overall water splitting at a cell voltage of 1.6 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), because of its well-developed hierarchical structure and highly conductive NCNTs that enable efficient transport of generated carriers. The calcination temperature affects the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of NiFe-NCNT. Further, loading MoS(2)nanosheets improves the HER activities of the NiFe-NCNT. The amount of MoS(2)nanosheets affects the activities of electrocatalytic overall water splitting. These materials reveal excellent electrocatalytic activity due to the synergistic effect of NiFe-NCNT and MoS(2)nanosheets as well as the NiFe alloy nanoparticles.									20	0	0	0	1	0	19			2052-1553			WOS:000573315100006

Such low overpotentials for the OER, to our knowledge, have not been found on any mixed oxide electrode material reported in literature till today. Small La addition improved the BET surface area and porosity of the oxide catalyst powder and reduced the charge transfer resistance for the OER on the electrode made of oxide powder.

Herein, a hierarchical carbon nanotube (CNT) forest was used to load TMP materials to form self-supported electrodes (NiCoP-CNT@NiCo/CP and NiFeP-CNT@NiCo/CP), guaranteeing catalytic electrodes with a high amount of metal sites and excellent electronic conductivity. As expected, the electrodes display low overpotentials of 82 and 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER in alkaline solutions, respectively. Moreover, the overall water electrolyzer assembled with NiCoP-CNT@NiCo/CP as a cathode and NiFeP-CNT@NiCo/CP as an anode exhibits superior electrolysis performance (1.58 V/10 mA cm(-2)). The remarkable performance is attributed to the unique hierarchical CNT forest architecture of the as-prepared catalytic electrodes and the synergistic effect between TMP nanoparticles and CNTs.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500038

The NCW with open aligned microchannels facilitates O2 and electrolyte permeation and transportation, while the uniformly distributed graphitic carbon layer-encapsulated Co nanoparticles on NCW featuring fast electron transfer kinetics provide abundant triphase reaction sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Co@NCW exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.89 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for ORR outperforming the Pt/C (0.85 V vs. RHE) and an overpotential of 410 mV for the OER (10 mA cm-2) comparable to RuO2 (340 mV). A rechargeable ZAB assembled with Co@NCW presents a power density of 47.5 mW cm-2 and excellent stability at 5 mA cm-2 for 240 h. This work provides an effective strategy to fabricate a practically applicable oxygen electrode for ZABs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000854093600002

Accordingly, nickel oxide has attracted attention as a potential OER catalyst, but its inferior catalytic activity due to the non-participation of its concealed active sites is challenging. Herein, a reported nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon shell-embedded nickel nanoparticle electrocatalyst (Ni-D-700) was investigated to enhance its oxygen evolution activity via the surface dissolution method. This method, which is widely used for dealloying bimetallic nanoparticles to improve their activity, was employed to study the effect of leaching and its duration on a monometallic nanoparticle catalyst. The resultant oxide layer formed on the surface of the nickel nanoparticles (Ni-0@Ni2+/Ni3+) exhibited outstanding oxygen evolution activity (1.52 V onset potential vs. RHE, 53.4 mV dec(-1) Tafel slope and 360 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density) and mass activity, much higher than that of the precursor catalyst. This is attributed to the participation of maximum metal/metal oxide interfaces generated in the process of leaching, which otherwise tend to remain subdued, leading to insufficient catalytic activity.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2052-1537		WOS:000582790200012

Highly crystalline Ba0.5Sr0.5CoxFe1-xO3-delta particles with the full compositional range were synthesized by an ionic-liquid route, leading to a high degree of phase purity. The structure and composition of the materials were investigated by quantitative XRD and EDX. Electrochemical studies in oxygen-saturated alkaline solutions show that the overall reactivity of the catalyst supported on mesoporous carbon increases as the Co content increases above 50%. DFT calculations, based on the structural parameters obtained from XRD refinements, show that the oxygen-vacancy formation energy decreases as the Co content increases. Oxygen vacancies lead to a higher electron density at the Co atoms, which are identified as the key ORR active sites.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000384959100019

Dislocations, as a typical defect structure, are worthy of further investigation due to the versatility and sophistication of structures and the influence of local strain effects on the catalytic performance. Herein, this study adopted a low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis strategy to introduce numerous dislocation-strained structures into the in-plane and out-of-plane of MoS2 nanosheets. Superior HER catalytic activity of 5.85 mmol.g(-1).h(-1) under visible light was achieved based on the high-density dislocations and the corresponding strain field.

Interest in transition metal carbides and nitrides has been aroused by their promising properties that make them potential substitutes for Pt-group metals as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In this review, we discuss systematically the recent progress in the development of group IV-VI metal carbides and nitrides toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Some strategies for designing such catalysts and improving their efficiency and reliability, including nanostructuring, optimizing hydrogen binding energy, interaction with the supporting material, and exploiting hybrid structures, are highlighted. We conclude with an outlook on the challenges in designing future HER electrocatalysts.									888	37	0	0	43	1	898			1359-7345			WOS:000324404100002	23982806

Thus, the research and development of base metal-based catalysts focus on improving the performance of catalysts with less consideration of the influence of metal content on the cost. Herein, we report the synthesis and catalysis properties of two base metal (Ni and Fe) catalysts supported by a high nitrogen containing carbon aerogel. A melamine formaldehyde (MF) aerogel was used as a support, and high concentration of Ni2+/Fe3+ metal ions were in situ implanted into the three-dimensional network of gels in the sol-gel process. The high metal loading of 43 wt% provided adequate active sites for the catalytic process. The high N content of 11.3 wt% in MF aerogels also improved the surface structure effect of the catalysts during the catalytic process. The prepared aerogel-based catalysts exhibited enhanced catalytic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The two-electrode system for water splitting, with prepared samples as the anode and the cathode, exhibited a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.63 V. This high loading and high yield catalyst synthesis method provides a new potential way for the synthesis of functional catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000692160300001

The effect of experimental variables, like total Co2+ + Pb2+ concentration, Co2+/(Co2+ + Pb2+) ratio, potential, pH and angular speed of the anode, on the deposit composition has been investigated. The results are discussed according to the theories developed for the cathodic deposition of alloys, concluding that the system conforms to the trends typical of irregular deposition. XRD and XPS analyses have shown that the deposits are amorphous, but have not allowed to fully elucidate the nature of the Co containing compound(s) codeposited with PbO2. When used as anodes for oxygen evolution in aqueous NaOH, the PbO2 + CoOx composites exhibit Tafel slopes of ca. 60 mV decade(-1) and a reaction order of 1 with respect to OH-. Their overpotential is similar to that of PbO2 + Co3O4 composites prepared by anodisation of suspensions. A marked activation of the PbO3 + CoOx electrodes, during ca. 3 days of continuous oxygen evolution, is explained as the result of an increase of the Co surface concentration, as shown by XPS and impedance data.

In this work, we apply this operando technique to study the surface chemical composition evolution on a Co metal electrode in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution under various electrical biases. It is found that an similar to 12.2 nm-thick layer of Co(OH)(2) forms at a potential of about -0.4 V-Ag/AgCl, and upon increasing the anodic potential to about +0.4 V-Ag/Cl, this layer is partially oxidized into cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH). A CoOOH/Co(OH)(2) mixture layer is formed on the top of the electrode surface. Finally, the oxidized surface layer can be reduced to Co-0 at a cathodic potential of -1.35 V-Ag/Cl. These observations indicate that the ultrathin layer containing cobalt oxyhydroxide is the active phase for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on a Co electrode in an alkaline electrolyte, consistent with previous studies.									44	1	0	0	1	0	44			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600033	28846416

In this study, a novel coral-like Ru/carbon (Ru/C) electrocatalyst was synthesized via a solvothermal approach with the assistance of 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ). This catalyst exhibited excellent performance for the HER in acidic media. The overpotential of the Ru/C catalyst was 41 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), the Tafel slope was 46 mV/dec, which was only 12 mV/dec higher than that of the Pt/C catalyst (34 mV/dec). Moreover, the Ru/C catalyst exhibited excellent stability. We believe that this novel Ru/C catalyst is a viable substitute for commercial Pt/C catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1452-3981			WOS:000477867100086

Recently, NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) has shown great potential to boost the OER process. However, limited active sites and poor conductivity severely hinder the further improvement of the OER performance. Herein, oxygen vacancy-rich hierarchical NiFe LDH (v-NiFe LDH) microtubes assembled from two dimensional (2D) nanosheets were synthesized via a template-assisted strategy. The plentiful oxygen vacancies (V-O) could efficiently promote the intrinsic conductivity of the obtained LDH. Meanwhile, featuring hierarchical microtubes and 2D nanosheets, the as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits abundant catalytically active sites and excellent structural stability. Benefitting from the defect and morphological engineering, the OER activity of v-NiFe LDH has obviously enhanced, with an ultralow overpotential of 195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 47.9 mV dec(-1), as well as long-term stability at 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, theoretical calculations further elucidate that the Fe site is the primary active site in v-NiFe LDH and V-O can enhance the conductivity and accelerate the OER kinetic process through decreasing the bandgap of NiFe LDH and reaction energy of the rate-determining step.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000707139000001

Here, we report the synthesis of nickel indium thiospinel nanosheets supported on carbon nanofibers (denoted as NiIn2S4/CNFs) via a facile in situ solvothermal growth process and, for the first time, demonstrate its superior bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic performances as a precatalyst. Electrocatalytic experiments show that NiIn2S4/CNFs not only exhibits a positive half-wave potential of 0.81 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) but also delivers a lower overpotential of 0.39 V for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming those of monometallic Ni or In sulfides. Theoretical calculations confirm that the (220) and (111) plane in NiIn2S4 are selectively active to the ORR and OER, respectively. Apart from the intrinsic nature of NiIn2S4, the superior OER activity of NiIn2S4/CNFs is also related to the oxide/hydroxide species in-situ-formed on NiIn2S4 surface under the OER condition. Moreover, the developed NiIn2S4/ CNFs pre-catalyst is demonstrated to be an efficient air-cathode for Zn-air batteries. This work brings a new perspective for designing various ternary thiospinels for energy conversion and storage.									149	2	0	0	8	0	149				2639-4979		WOS:000519669700021

This paper presents a study of doping dependent O2 evolution electrocatalysis of Pr-doped CaMnO3 via in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) combined with ex situ cyclic voltammetry studies. ETEM studies of heterogeneous catalysis are a challenge, since the reactions in the H2O vapor phase cannot directly be observed. It is shown that the oxidation of silane by free oxygen to solid SiO2-x can be used to monitor catalytic oxygen evolution. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) as well as the in situ X-ray absorption study of near edge structures (XANES) in H2O vapor reveals that the Mn valence is decreased in the active state. Careful TEM analysis of samples measured by ex situ cyclic voltammetry and an in situ bias-controlled ETEM study allows us to distinguish between self-formation during oxygen evolution and corrosion at the Pr1-xCaxMnO3-H2O interface. Including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, trends in O2 evolution activity and defect chemistry in the active state can be correclated to doping induced changes of the electronic band structure in A-site doped manganites.									63	3	0	0	5	0	64			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000307566200003

Semiconductor materials based heterogeneous nanostructures have attracted much attention to be used as catalysts, co-catalysts, photocatalysts and photo absorbers. The present work deals with the investigation of heterostructures of molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) and tungsten selenide (WSe2) nanosheets prepared through liquid exfoliation method as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Our experimental studies reveal that MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures synthesized using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exhibits superior HER performance. These novel structures leads to the exposure of more catalytically active sites and maintains effective electron transport, resulting in a small Tafel slope of 80 mV/decay and large electrochemical surface area (ECSA) of 87.

A peak with a 2 theta of 36 degrees corresponded to the (110) plane confirming the formation of the rhombohedral crystal structure of NiMnO3. The existence of Mn-O and Ni-O stretching vibration modes was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. FTIR spectra confirmed the existence of the metal-oxygen bond of NiMnO3. The synthesized ternary Ni-based material was found to be spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 0.81 mu m. The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was explored on 0.02 M samarium (Sm)-doped NiMnO3 demonstrating outstanding OER action with low 321 mV, a low Tafel slope value (109 mV dec(-1)), and low charge-transfer resistance (0.19 omega). Moreover, the BET results suggest that the 0.02 M Sm-doped NiMnO3 exhibited elevated surface area (78.78 m(2) g(-1)) with a mesoporous character. Therefore, NiMnO3 doped with high concentrations of a rare earth metal, Sm, is proposed as a suitable material for next-generation water splitting applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2516-0230			WOS:000797037300001	36134128

Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with a lower electrode potential instead of oxygen evolution reaction (OER, water-splitting anode) in the water-urea electrolysis is an energy-saving approach. In this paper, NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF is synthesized by hydrothermal reactions and explored as both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and UOR catalyst electrodes. This composite catalyst shows high catalytic bifunctional activities towards both HER and UOR. To validate both catalytic UOR and HER activities and durability, a two-electrode water-urea electrolyzer composed of NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF as both anode and cathode materials is constructed (NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)/NF parallel to NiMoO4-Ni(OH)(2)). Experiments show that a voltage of 1.341 V with a high stability (over 3000 CV cycles) can be achieved at 10 mA cm(-2), which are much better than those obtained using a Pt/C parallel to IrO2.

They occur naturally in hexagonal (2H) forms but can also be synthesized in metallic trigonal (1T) phases that are active hydrogen evolution catalysts and exhibit interesting phenomena such as superconductivity and charge density waves. Sparse experimental evidence indicates that 2D crystals of metallic TMDs degrade rapidly in air via an unknown oxidation mechanism. Here we present a computational study on oxidation at the edges and surfaces of 1T-MoS(2)and 1T-TaS(2)monolayers based on density functional theory calculations. Our results suggest that both 1T-MoS(2)and 1T-TaS(2)are very susceptible to oxidation because there are negligible energetic barriers to the dissociation of oxygen molecules at edge sites. However, further oxidation requires the substitution of sulphur atoms by oxygen, the rate of which is limited in the case of 1T-TaS(2)because the detachment of SO(2)groups is disfavored by 1.2 eV. Conversely, oxygen molecules adsorbed on 1T-MoS(2)dissociate directly at molybdenum atoms at the edge, forming intermediate S-O-Mo structures that facilitate the subsequent formation and detachment of SO2. Oxidation is not harmful to the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction on 1T-MoS(2)but is detrimental to that on 1T-TaS2, which explains some apparently inconsistent experimental results. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of ambient oxidative degradation of metallic TMDs and the effect of oxidation on their catalytic properties.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2053-1583			WOS:000553697300001

Aiming to enhance the utilization and durability of noble metals, a mesoporous Sb-doped SnO2 material with high surface area and conductivity was synthesized via soft-template method to support IrO2 catalyst. Physical characterization reveals that the as-prepared composite exhibits a rough morphology with the weak crystallinity IrO2 upper layer covering the rutile SnO2 crystalline phase. Electrochemical test for the IrO2-loading-dependant activity finds that both the area-free activity and mass-specific current on the 31 wt% sample are the optimal, meaning the excellent dispersion effect coming from the mesoporous Sb-SnO2 support and the synergy between the catalytic particles and Sb dopant. In addition, the enhancement in mass transfer efficiency and conductivity coming from the porous, IrO2-covered cross-linked morphology and the support-active component interaction, the supported IrO2 with 50 wt% loading marks the maximum normalized charge (227 C g(-1) IrO2) and the highest apparent current at 1.75 V. What is more, this composite catalyst with the noble metal oxide coating is much more durable during continuous oxygen evolution procedure under a constant potential of 1.6 V because of the anchor effect from the carrier on the catalyst and a protective effect from the noble metal layer on the non-acid-tolerant support.									25	0	0	0	1	0	25			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000410473100008

Herein, 3D mesoporous nickel iron selenide with rose-like microsphere architecture was directly grown on Ni foam via a successive two-step hydrothermal method. The unique 3D mesoporous rose-like morphology leads to a higher number of active sites as well as fast mass and electron transport through the entire electrode, and facilitates the release of O-2 bubbles formed during the OER catalysis. As a result, the synthesized Ni0.76Fe0.24Se exhibits superior OER performances, with an ultralow overpotential of 197 mV needed to produce a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, outperforming all transition metal selenide OER catalysts reported to date.									47	3	0	0	1	0	47			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000427907700035

In order to enhance water splitting efficiency, it is essential to promote gas revolution from catalysts surface, reduce the over-potential of oxygen evolution (OER), and inhibit the production of the hydrogen peroxide by-product. To realize them, in this work, we take a cue from nature to promote water splitting activity of hollow porous Fe3O4 microspheres (M-Fe3O4) with the aids of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin monolayer was self-assembled on the surface of M-Fe3O4 catalysts. It transported newly-generated oxygen molecules away from catalysts surface and exhibited chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect during OER reaction. Owing to the "helping hand" of hemoglobin, the OER onset potential of hollow porous Fe3O4 microspheres reduced by 100 mV and the current density was enhanced 2 folds. The results indicate a new strategy for designing earth-abundant catalysts which combine the merits of oxygen transferring and CISS effect for electrocatalytic water splitting.

However, in amorphous electrocatalysts, the design principle of spin regulation to promote catalytic activity remains unclear. Herein, we synthesized a series of heteroatom-doped amorphous transition metal sulfides with regulated spin states using a one-step hydrothermal process. Especially in Mo-doped CoS, the spin state of Co(2+ )was successfully modulated to the low-spin state, which could optimize the adsorption free energy of various intermediates, improving the oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. The fabricated Zn-air batteries (ZABs) delivered good cycle stability (over 100 h). The large ZAB (100 cm(2)) exhibited a high discharge voltage (1.25 V under 0.5 A) and a superior overall mass-energy density (93 W h kg(-1)), which illuminated a 2.5-m light-emitting-diode ribbon for over seven days. This work provides new insight into the mechanism of engineering spin states in amorphous materials for oxygen electrocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000815449200001

Cyclic voltammetry of the resulting (Ir-TiO2)/Ti electrode in acidic solutions revealed features of IrO2 formation at positive applied potential values during continuous potential cycling. SEM micrographs showed good Ir dispersion on the Ti substrate, while EDS and XPS analysis of the deposits provided direct evidence for Ir and IrO2 presence on the surface of the electrodes. These electrodes, when tested as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) anodes by slow potential sweep voltammetry and constant potential amperometry, exhibited one of the highest mass specific activities for OER (560 mA mg(Ir)(-1)) reported for IrO2 anode materials.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000505643500013

In this work, we demonstrate the development of a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst based on an amorphous Co-Fe-B-i directly grown on three-dimensional nickel foam via a facile solution approach. Co-Fe-B-i electrocatalysts on nickel foam exhibits an overpotential of similar to 307 mV to achieve the geometrical current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of similar to 68.6 mV dec(-1) and outstanding durability for 40 h at a mass loading of 1.2 mg cm(-2), which is superior to those of borate-based electrocatalysts reported in the literature This remarkable preliminary electrocatalytic performance in Co-Fe-B-i originates from the synergistic influence of unique binder-free ultra-thin nanosheets on the three dimensional porous structure, amorphous nature of multimetal-metalloid complex with highly abundant catalytically active sites and high conductivity of nickel foam. This work holds a great promise in the design and development of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts at a large-scale based on an amorphous bimetallic borate nanosheets using a facile one-step solution process.									5	3	0	0	0	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000486177700016

However, most of the synthetic methods required the use of templates to construct precisely designed nanostructured carbon. Herein, we introduced an ultrasound-triggered route for the synthesis of a piperazine-containing covalent triazine framework (P-CTF). The ultrasonic energy triggered both the polycondensation of monomers and the assembly into a nanoflower-shaped morphology without utilizing any templates. Subsequent carbonization of P-CTF led to the formation of nitrogen, phosphorus, and fluorine tri-doped porous carbon (NPF@CNFs) with a well-maintained nanoflower morphology. The resultant NPF@CNFs showed high electrocatalytic activity and stability toward bifunctional electrolysis, which was better than the commercial Pt/C and IrO2 electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. As a further demonstration, employing NPF@CNFs as air electrode materials resulted in an excellent performance of liquid-state and solid-state Zn-air batteries, showing great potentials of the obtained multiple heteroatom-doped porous carbon electrocatalysts for wearable electronics.Y									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000634759500069	33703876

Hemin was deposited on glassy carbon (GC) electrodes through electropolymerisation with approximately 42% coverage and this mitigated the detrimental effect of accumulated oxygen on the subsequent growth of IrOx. When the IrOx catalyst was fabricated through 5 min of electroflocculation (coverage of approximately 8.43 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2) Ir), the stability time (the time required to reach the overpotential of 1.0 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) was approximately 7 h, which is 5-fold higher than that of the process without polymerised hemin, and 29.1-fold higher than that of the electroflocculation method reported in the literature. With the aid of hemin-catalysed oxygen depletion, the IrOx at the interface with the polymerised hemin is apparently deposited in a smaller and well-defined structure. The in situ spectroelectrochemical results revealed a lower dissolution rate for this specific IrOx structure, which facilitated subsequent electroflocculation towards the formation of a continuously structured deposit resistant to degradation. In 1 M NaOH, the IrOx catalyst sustained electrolysis (10 mA cm(-2)) for more than 20 h. In 1 M H2SO4, the overpotential (eta(t=24) h) remained below 0.35 V. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that have demonstrated a hydrous IrOx catalyst that can maintain its stability for over 24 h of the OER.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395075600063

We use an implicit solvation model of the electrolyte to implement an electronic grand canonical formalism for treating the variable charge state of the semiconductor surface under illumination and an applied bias. This protocol is applied to investigate the photodriven mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) over a cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) surface, which demonstrates that a Heyrovsky H-2 generation step is rate-determining on the SiC (110) surface. The reaction free energy barrier of this step is heavily influenced by the surface charge density that is controlled by illumination and applied bias. The computed photon wavelengths required to overcome the Heyrovsky step barrier fall in the visible spectrum, thereby establishing the feasibility of HER reactions on the SiC (110) surface. Beyond offering insight into the HER mechanism on SiC, this work provides a general framework for modeling photoelectrochemical reactions occurring at an interface between a semiconductor surface and a liquid electrolyte.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000599610500011

Each CNT was capped with CoSe2 NP, which not only effectively avoided self-agglomeration of CoSe2 NPs but also protected the CoSe2 NPs from electrolyte etching. The synergism of bamboo-like CNT with high conductivity and the uniformly distributed CoSe2 NPs endowed CoSe2@N/C-CNT the better bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward both HER (hydrogen evolution reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction).

A self-embedded templating strategy for preparing the TMO@carbon quasiaerogels (TMO@C-QAs) is proposed. By mimicking an aerogel structure at a microscale, the TMO@C-QA successfully assembles size-controllable TMO nanoparticles into 3D interconnected structure with surface-enriched carbon species. The morphological evolutions of intermediates verify that the self-embedded Ostwald ripening templating approach is responsible for the dual-channel TMO@C-QA formation. The general self-embedded templating strategy is easily extended to prepare various TMO@C-QAs, including the Co3O4@C-QA, Mn3O4@C-QA, Fe2O3@C-QA, and NiO@C-QA. Benefiting from the unparalleled 3D interconnected network of aerogels, the Co3O4@C-QA displays superior bifunctional catalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as well as high specific capacity and excellent long-term stability for lithium-ion battery (LIB) anode. A proof-of-concept battery-powered electrolyzer with Co3O4@C-QA cathode and anode powered by a full LIB with Co3O4@C-QA anode is presented. The battery-powered electrolyzer made of the state-of-the-art TMOs can exhibit great competitive advantages due to its supreme multifunctional energy conversion performance for future water electrolysis.									33	1	0	0	5	0	33			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000517413000001

The electrolytic performances can be much enhanced with a synergistic design of the MOFs, which was realized as uniformly well-mixed and dispersed Fe- and Ni-MOFs (termed as MFN-MOFs) in-situ grown on backbones of nickel foam (NF). The electrocatalyst thus developed exhibited ultra-high activities at high current densities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH, delivering 10 and 500 mA cm(-2) at ultralow overpotentials of 79 and 234 mV, respectively with a small Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec(-1) for the HER and achieving ultralow overpotentials of 235 and 294 mV for the OER at 50 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively with a small Tafel slope of 55.4 mV dec(-1). The inter-molecular synergistic interactions between the well-mixed and dispersed Fe- and Ni-MOFs not only facilitate the critical charge transfer for the redox reactions but also disperse the active metal ion sites to enhance their degree of utilization to achieve exceptional OER and HER performances. The MFN-MOFs/NF//MFN-MOFs/NF couple exhibited ultralow cell voltages of 1.495 V@10 mA cm(-2) and 1.80 V@500 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of only 79.5 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art bifunctional electrode couples and benchmark couple of Pt-C/NF//IrO2/NF. More importantly, the MFN-MOFs/NF electrode exhibited ultrastability at high current densities, with a minor decay of 3.7% in a chronopotentiometric stability test conducted at a commercially viable high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for overall water-splitting over 100 h. This synergistic effect boosting design concept for electrocatalysts was successfully demonstrated, opening up a new way for catalyst design toward large-scale H-2 production.									136	8	0	0	5	0	138			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000458419000001

This material offers a high electrochemically active surface area (250 - 400 cm2 g-) and a large pore volume; it consists of one electrically conductive unit and can be cut to any shape or size. The authors used chronoamperometry (CA) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) to study the anodic oxidation of BPA. The working electrode consisted of circular Ni foam pieces (12 mm in diameter) attached to a Ni wire. All studies were conducted in 0.5 M aq. KOH containing 0.005 M BPA. The oxidation took place in the presence of O2(g) either generated in situ through the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at E) 1.6 V vs. RHE or provided by bubbling O2(g) through the cell.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1064-8208			INSPEC:13327725

Here, we screened and utilized in situ reactive probes that can selectively target specific oxygen intermediates with high rates to investigate the OER intermediates and pathway on NiFe oxyhydroxide. Most importantly, the oxygen atom transfer (OAT) probes (e.g., 4-(diphenylphosphino) benzoic acid) could efficiently inhibit the OER kinetics by scavenging the OER intermediates, exhibiting lower OER currents, larger Tafel slopes, and larger kinetic isotope effect (KIE) values, while probes with other reactivities demonstrated much smaller effects. Combining the OAT reactivity with electrochemical kinetic and operando Raman spectroscopic techniques, we identified a resting Fe=O intermediate in the Ni-O scaffold and a rate-limiting O-O chemical coupling step between a Fe=O moiety and a vicinal bridging O. DFT calculation further revealed a longer Fe=O bond formed on the surface and a large kinetic energy barrier of the O-O chemical coupling step, corroborating the experimental results. These results point to a new direction of liberating lattice O and expediting O-O coupling for optimizing NiFe-based OER electrocatalyst.									42	2	0	0	4	0	41			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000614064400030	33439638

Highly active and stable electrocatalysts can be achieved by amorphous materials with tunable polyelemental compositions, and further enhanced with proper nanostructures. Herein, the ultrasonic-assisted template-free synthesis of amorphous polyelemental (Co, Ni, Fe, W, B, P) hollow nanoparticles (PE-HNP) is reported as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for both OER and HER. For HER, as-prepared PE-HNP attains 1200 mA cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of 195 mV. For OER, PE-HNP is in situ oxidized to form PEO-HNP, which attains 1200 mA cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of 309 mV. The activities of PE-HNP and PEO-HNP remain unaffected after 20 h HER or OER test at high current densities, showing higher activity and stability than the benchmark electrocatalysts Pt/C and IrO2, respectively. The PEO-HNPPE-HNP electrolyzer needs a 1.85 V cell voltage to drive a high current density of 400 mA cm(-2), which is much better than the IrO2Pt/C electrolyzer (2.15 V for 400 mA cm(-2)). The strategy provides a cost-effective and convenient method to synthesize amorphous polyelemental materials with designed hollow nanostructures for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2196-7350			WOS:000477206700001

The low efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is often considered as a bottleneck in overall water splitting. Herein, free-standing electrocatalysts consisting of perovskite hydroxide (SnFeNi) on self-supported Cu foam (CF) are demonstrated for overall water splitting. We developed A-SnFeNi/CF as an OER electrocatalyst by in situ growing perovskite hydroxide particles on CF and subsequently electrochemically activating them. The A-SnFeNi/CF catalyst exhibits an excellent OER performance with a low overpotential of 385 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which can be attributed to the fast electron transfer stemming from the intimate contact between the perovskite hydroxide particles and CF. By depositing ultrafine Pt nanoparticles (0.42 wt% loading) on CF, Pt-SnFeNi/CF presents a lower overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) than commercial Pt/C for the HER, owing to the synergy of Pt nanoparticles with perovskite hydroxides. Moreover, the water splitting device constructed with the free-standing SnFeNi/CF-based electrodes only needs 1.57 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), 50 mV lower than that of a commercial RuO2/CF||Pt/C/CF couple.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526703800010

CoSe2 with morphologies of amorphous, nanoparticles, nanosheets and nanobulks were controlled by adjusting additives of ammonium hydroxide, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine and hydrazine hydrate respectively, and be studied systematically by XRD, TEM, HRTEM, EDS. The electrochemical properties of the results were characterized by oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We found that the CoSe2 nanoparticles shows better OER property than other morphologies and that may due to the large specific surface area for nanoparticles. Besides, the CoSe2 nanoparticles also shows excellent ORR activity in the same environment with a low overpotential of 0.34 V to achieve 10mA/cm(2), which means a good potential for bifunctional electrochemical catalyze.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			0015-0193	1563-5112		WOS:000423478500016

By fine-tuning the mass proportions of precursors during copolymerization, the carbonization of corncob was successfully confined in the PCN interlayers. An electron transport highway from PCN to BC was built owing to the pi-electron delocalization. As a result, the non-covalent assembled PCN/BC composite rivaled popular nitrogen-doped carbon materials in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS), and meanwhile exhibited superior durability. Singlet oxygen (1O2) was identified as the primary reactive oxygen species. Combining theoretical calculations and in-situ detections, a novel 1O2 evolution route with respect to the dissociation of PMS at the S/O site and the formation of superoxide radical was decoded. This work offers a new idea for the synthesis of durable PMS activators and enriches mechanistic understanding of PMS decomposition over metal-free catalysts.									39	0	0	0	22	0	39			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655672700005

We synthesize a well-designed architecture comprising of lead grid wrapping by perpendicularly grown lead oxide flakes. Oxygen evolution activities are largely improved after carving the lead foil into lead grid and further enhanced by a secondary structure of lead oxide flakes, with a negatively-shift of onset potential (similar to 65 mV) and smaller overpotential to deliver a current density of 80 mA cm(-2) (similar to 350 mV). The electrode is demonstrated to be highly stable under acidic water at 60 degrees C for 8 h. We believe the excellence in electrochemistry is attributed to increased active sites, good electrical conductivity and sufficient porosity to facilitate reactant water flow and high gas permeability especially at high current densities.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000637755400004

IrOx-TiO2 interlayer was coated on titanium substrate by impregnation-thermal decomposition method from a mixture of TiN nanoparticles and H2IrCl6 solution at 500 degrees C. The results showed that the service life of Ti/IrOx-TiO2/IrO2 was a factor of six times longer than that of Ti/IrO2, which was attributed to the IrOx-TiO2 interlayer, it could form a metastable solid solution between IrOx and thin titanium oxide layer on titanium substrate during calcination. The interlayer contributed to the decrease in migration rate of oxygen atom or molecule toward substrate and the increase in bonding force among IrO2 layer, interlayer, and substrate. Therefore, besides keeping high electrocatalytic activity, the service life of Ti/IrOx-TiO2/IrO2 electrode was greatly improved, and its overall electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution was increased as well.									17	5	0	0	2	0	19			0021-891X			WOS:000286141700001

Oxides based on Ni and Fe in alkaline media have been proposed to avoid using critical raw materials. However, their ill-defined structures under OER conditions make the identification of key descriptors difficult. Here, we have studied Fe-Ni-Zn spinel oxides, with a well-defined crystal structure, as a platform to obtain general understanding on the key contributions. The OER reaches maximum performance when: (i) Zn is present in the Spinel structure, (ii) very dense, equimolar 1 : 1 : 1 stoichiometry sites appear on the surface as they allow the formation of oxygen vacancies where Zn favors pushing the electronic density that is pulled by the octahedral Fe and tetrahedral Ni redox pair lowering the overpotential. Our work proves cooperative electronic effects on surface active sites as key to design optimum OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000618982800001	33512070

This is due to its intrinsic eco-friendliness, and plausibly high efficiencies. However, the efficiency is hampered by sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. In this work, co-precipitation method followed by nitridation is used for fabricating highly efficient and stable Au-decorated Ni3N electrocatalyst for OER activity in alkaline solution. The as-prepared 2 wt % Au at Ni3N (2 %Au/Ni3N) nanoflower exhibits remarkable OER. Current density of 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 52 mV/dec, a relatively small overpotential of similar to 280 mV, and 94.8 % activity retention for over 10 hour of continuous operation are observed. This remarkable performance is one of the best OER results known so far for noble metal-supported nanostructured materials using alkaline solution as the electrolyte. From experimental results and calculations thereby, it is found that the Au nanocluster can effectively regulate Ni3N electronic structure, and reduce the energy barrier associated with OER activity. The synthesis approach given here not only provides a highly efficient electrocatalyst for energy conversion, but also offers a platform for controlling structural characteristics, thereby tuning the catalytic properties of the Au/Ni3N nanoflowers.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000501286600025

Here, we report a facile and economical synthesis of Co@CoNx/N-doped carbon tubes hybrid (Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid) via one-step pyrolysis of ZIF-67 at a low temperature of 650 degrees C with the introduction of urea, which functions as both nitrogen source and promoter of carbon tube growth. The resultant Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid exhibits bamboo-like structure with numerous active sites originated from abundant CoNx species, high nitrogen doping level and topological defects, rendering excellent catalytic activities towards OER in alkaline medium. As a result, the as-obtained Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid shows an overpotential of as low as 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1), which outperforms most noble metal-free electrocatalysts and even commercial IrO2 . Therefore, the Co@CoNx/NCT hybrid holds great promise for efficient electrocatalytic water oxidation applications.

NF as support can provide excellent conductivity and 3 dimensional skeleton, which facilitate the utilization of active sites and mass transfer of electrolyte. The ternary MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF also possess the advantage of synergistic effect between MnO2 and NiCo2O4, implying the enhanced intrinsic activity for OER. XRD, EDX and XPS confirm the existence and distribution of each element of MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF. SEM shows the hierarchical structure of MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF with vertically aligned MnO2/NiCo2O4 nanoflakes covering on the surface of NF, which is in favor of the more exposed active sites and the fast dissipation of O-2 bubbles. Additionally, to clearly testify the significance of the vertically aligned MnO2/NiCo2O4 nanoflakes, non-vertical MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF sample (MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF-1) is prepared for comparing OER performances in the same condition. OER measurements in alkaline solution show that ternary MnO2/NiCo2O4/NF displays better electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 340 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(2) than other samples. Therefore, ternary metal oxides with hierarchical structure on NF may be a promising choice for excellent electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Except the cyclization and disproportionation of cyclization are chemical-reaction-controlled process, the other three reactions are both diffusion-controlled and chemical-reaction-controlled processes. The formation of free and conjugated carbonyl group need the optimal cyclization rate, adequate unreacted linear PAI chains, and appropriate oxidation ability coordinated. The higher temperature, the faster rate and the higher extent of the cyclization and the crosslinking reactions as well as the faster disproportionation termination of cyclization. The length of the formed cyclic structures became shorter as the evolution of TOS process, especially for 265 degrees C. The crosslinking, oxygen uptake, dehydrogenation, and termination of cyclization reactions become dominant with the proceeding of TOS process, especially as the cyclization extent above 0.8 and at high temperature such as 265 degrees C.

Scanning electron microscopy revealed the electrodeposition of nano-CoOx with an average particle size of 25 nm onto MWNT/GCE. Also, the presence of nano-CoOx was revealed by energy dispersive X-ray spectra. The electrocatalytic activity of nano-CoOx and MWNT composite-modified GCE (CoOx-MWNT/GCE) has been examined towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by linear sweep voltammetry. The OER is significantly enhanced at CoOx-MWNT/GCE, as demonstrated by a negative shift in the polarization curves at the CoOx-MWNT/GCE compared with that obtained at the CoOx-GCE and GCE. Optimization of the operating experimental conditions (i.e., solution pH and loading level of nano-CoOx) has been achieved to maximize the electrocatalytic activity of CoOx-MWNT/GCE. The maximum electrocatalytic activity towards the OER was obtained in alkaline media (pH = 13). The electrocatalytic activity of CoOx-MWNT/GCE increased with the number of potential cycles employed for the CoOx deposition till a certain loading (20 cycles) beyond which an adverse effect is observed. The fabricated CoOx-MWNT/GCE exhibited a good stability and durability. The value of energy saving per gram of oxygen gas at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 19 .3 kWh kg(-1).									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0250-4707	0973-7669		WOS:000350801000020

Although spinel-type binary transition metal oxides (AB(2)O(4), A, B = metal) represent a class of promising candidates for water oxidation catalysis, their intrinsically inferior electrical conductivity exert remarkably negative impacts on their electrochemical performances. Herein, we demonstrates a feasible electrospinning approach to concurrently synthesize CoFe2O4 nanoparticles homogeneously embedded in 1D N-doped carbon nanofibers (denoted as CoFe2O4@N-CNFs). By integrating the catalytically active CoFe2O4 nanoparticles with the N-doped carbon nanofibers, the as-synthesized CoFe2O4@N-CNF nanohybrid manifests superior OER performance with a low overpotential, a large current density, a small Tafel slope, and long-term durability in alkaline solution, outperforming the single component counterparts (pure CoFe2O4 and N-doped carbon nanofibers) and the commercial RuO2 catalyst. Impressively, the overpotential of CoFe2O4@N-CNFs at the current density of 30.0 mA cm(-2) negatively shifts 186 mV as compared with the commercial RuO2 catalyst and the current density of the CoFe2O4@N-CNFs at 1.8 V is almost 3.4 times of that on RuO2 benchmark. The present work would open a new avenue for the exploration of cost-effective and efficient OER electrocatalysts to substitute noble metals for various renewable energy conversion/storage applications.									157	7	0	0	7	0	159			2198-3844			WOS:000416155900013	29201620

Herein, we successfully design a novel bi-metal oxide hybrid catalyst (ZnCo2O4-CNT) by inserting Zn ions. Benefiting from the robust synergetic effects between porous ZnCo2O4 and CNTs, the high conductivity and the unique nanostructure, the ZnCo2O4-CNT shows lots of accessible active sites and improved reactants and electrons transfer. As expected, the hybrid shows higher ORR and OER performances with larger limited diffusion current density (5.72 mA cm(-2)) and lower OER over-potential (0.49 V) than Pt/C and other ZnCo2O4-CNT samples. In addition, rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled with the bi-functional catalyst exhibits a high power density of 249.4 mW cm(-2), a strong discharge durability and charge-discharge stability of 240 cycles. Notably, the flexible zinc-air battery also shows good battery performances with high power density and good flexibility. Hence, exploiting efficient bi-functional catalytic materials with excellent ORR and OER performance and assembling flexible devices will improve the development of current zinc-air batteries battery industry.

Ternary IrOx-Sb2O5-SnO2 has been shown to be among the best elecytrocatalysts for oxygen evolution. Its high stability and relatively low cost will make it more attractive than IrOx and many other electrocatalytic materials. In this paper, the open-circuit potential, voltammetric behavior, oxygen evolution mechanism, and kinetics of the IrOx-Sb2O5-SnO2 coated titanium anodes were studied. It was found that the open-circuit potential could change significantly during the initial period of time probably because of the hydration of the coating film. Cyclic voltammograms obtained on Ti/IrOx-Sb2O5-SnO2 were somewhat different from those on IrOx, coated anodes. Apparent cathodic peaks from Ir(III)/Ir(IV) and lr(IV)/Ir(V) were observed. However, the corresponding anodic peaks were very weak. Voltammetric investigation also showed that Ti/IrOx-Sb2O5-SnO2 could provide fast electron transfer. Despite high anodic stability, severe damage occurred when a Ti/IrOx-Sb2O5-SnO2 electrode was cathodically polarized. An O-2 evolution mechanism involving cyclic formation and decomposition of =-IrO2 was proposed. The Tafel slope and partial derivativeE/partial derivativelog a(H)(+) obtained were 86 and 45 mV dec(-1), respectively.									147	18	1	0	10	2	153			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000175356900004

In the technique employed, the time evolution of oxygen sorption into the film was monitored using the phosphorescence of singlet oxygen as a spectroscopic probe. Although the effect of adding up to 1 mol % of the cross-linker is clearly manifested in the molecular weight and T-g of these samples, values of D are only moderately influenced. Nevertheless, a systematic decrease in the value of D is discernible as the extent of cross-linking is increased. Although it is reasonable to expect that, in a glassy polymer, cross-linking should not significantly perturb the local motions and confined changes in free volume that influence the translational motion of a small penetrant such as oxygen, our data indicate that even small amounts of a cross-linker can, nevertheless, have a noticeable and potentially meaningful effect. Although UV irradiation of the polymer films disrupts the cinnamic acid derived cross-linker via a [2 + 2] cycloreversion reaction, the photoinduced changes observed in D appear, rather, to reflect degradation reactions in the PMMA-based polymer.									26	0	0	0	6	0	26			1944-8244			WOS:000267535900019	20355988

However, most QD-carbon hybrids show lower catalytic activities than that theoretically predicted due to the aggregation of the QD-carbon nanostructures during processing. Herein, biomass is used as a carbon source to prepare QD carbon nanostructures (Ni@C-N) to address the aforementioned issue. The cells walls and membranes in the biomass materials are usually rich in sites that could regulate the deposition and growth of Ni from a salt precursor by a simple solution impregnation method. Due to the abundance of the seeding sits and the limited supply of Ni+, the Ni particles size is restricted to the QD level with 3-4 nm. The formed Ni compounds QD are strongly linked to the cells walls and membranes, which could be maintained after subsequent heat treatment. The prepared 3D architecture has high catalytic activity, large surface area, strong physical integration, and rapid charge transfer capability, which collectively enhances the performance toward oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, opening the door to empower the next-generation green fuel conversion for carbon neutral.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-7350			WOS:000739909200001

Herein, macroporous CoO covered by Co/N-doped graphitic carbon nanosheet arrays (mac-CoO@Co/NGC NSAs) were constructed by engineering a mesoporous CoO nanowire (mes-CoO NWAs) core with highly conductive Co nanoparticles coated by a N-doped graphitic carbon (Co/NGC) shell. Thein situderived Co/NGC shell not only introduces electrocatalytic active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but also promotes the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through the strong interaction between the CoO core and the Co/NGC shell. Moreover, the highly conductive Co/NGC shell crosslinks the isolated mesoporous CoO nanowires into a nanosheet rich in macropores, ensuring effective electron and mass transfer. Furthermore, the chemically stable N-doped graphitic carbon layer and physically stable hierarchical nanosheet arrays ensure the stability of the catalyst. Owing to the desirable interfaces and pore architecture, the as-prepared mac-CoO@Co/NGC NSAs can serve as highly effective, binder-free electrocatalysts for overall water splitting with a stable cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2)for 35 h.									35	1	0	0	1	0	35			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000541868300029	32409798

The electrochemical stability of the bare and platinized oxide supports was examined from -0.8 to 1.4 V vs. NHE. The Sn-In2O3 surface was generally stable at positive potentials, but experienced severe degradation at negative potentials due to the reduction/oxidation of the surface Sn and In species. In-SnO2 supports showed significant degradation over the entire potential range, which was caused by the preferential formation of Sn, SnO and In species. Neither Sn-In2O3 nor In-SnO2 are suitable as supports for hydrogen evolution catalysts. However, it was shown that Sn-In2O3 possessed very good stability at potentials relevant to the oxygen reduction reaction (>0.6 V), which enables its application as a cathode electrocatalyst support for PEM fuel cells.

In this study, a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst based on La0.6Sr0.4Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (LSCF) was designed and synthesized using the hydrothermal method combined with chemical solution deposition. LSCF nanocubes provided more surface oxygen vacancies and catalytically active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions. In comparison, silver nanoparticles and graphene provided a fast pathway for electron transfer and mass diffusion since the electron transfer from Ag to LSCF can accelerate the adsorption of O-2 and increase the length of O-O bond. The integration of Ag, LSCF and graphene leads to the formation of an efficient nanointerface and good bifunctional electrocatalytic performance with a charge and discharge potential gap of 0.71 V. The flexible Zn-air battery with Ag/LSCF@graphene as the cathodic catalyst exhibited a high power density of 99.62 mW cm(-2), a large specific capacity of 583.4 mAh g(Zn)(-1), as well as superior charge/discharge stability even at different bending angles. This study may lay a basis for the exploitation of precious metal-free electrocatalysts and the application of perovskite oxides in energy storage and conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000860942200003

However, their low electrical conductivity, the collapse of the structure during the cycles and agglomeration in thermal treatment, which can degrade the electrochemical properties, are still puzzles for researchers. Herein, we present a facile method to synthesize mesoporous N-doped carbon matrix modified with cobalt and cobalt oxide (Co-CoO@NC) micro-disk derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks, alleviating the agglomeration of the cobalt nanoparticles to form CoO with abundant oxygen vacancies and introducing nitrogen in the carbon matrix with strong metal-N-doped carbon bridging bonds. The porous structure shows numerous mesoporous with diameters of 4-7nm and an excellent specific surface area as high as 739.4m(2) g(-1). The lithium-oxygen batteries based on Co-CoO@NC electrode show improved electrochemical performance, with a high initial discharge capacity up to 5582 mAh g(-1) at 0.05mA cm(-2) and preferable cycling stability with a cut-off specific capacity of 500 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 mA cm(-2). The improved performance is mainly ascribed to the synergic effect of the porous structure, CoO and strong metal-N-doped carbon bridging bonds, leading to the excellent OER and ORR activities.									8	2	0	0	0	0	8			2365-6549			WOS:000443225100014

Herein, we reported novel ultrathin tantalum disulfide nanosheets (TaS2 NSs) prepared by electrochemically exfoliating bulk TaS2 with an alternating voltage in an acidic electrolyte. The obtained TaS2 NS electrocatalyst possessed an ultrathin structure with a lateral size of 2 mu m and a thickness of similar to 3 nm. Owing to the unique 2D structure, the achieved TaS2 NSs displayed remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the HER by a small overpotential of 197 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 100 mV dec(-1) in acidic solution, much lower than those of TaS2 (>547 mV and 216 mV dec(-1), respectively) and other reported TaS2-based HER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, highly efficient full water splitting could be realized with two electrodes in which TaS2 NSs acted as the cathode while Ir/C served as the anode, with help of two AA size batteries or solar cells. By replacing the oxygen evolution reaction with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), bifunctional TaS2 NSs enabled an energy-effective HER process in the cathode and UOR process in the anode with decreased applied potential.									14	0	1	0	2	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000538515700016	32378411

In this study, a metal-organic framework based synthetic route to couple two non-noble-metal-based catalysts, CoP and Mo2C, supported on nitrogen-doped carbon has been developed. The strategy enables the formation of a nanohybrid with an attractive pea-like morphology, in which spherical CoP particles (approximate to 10 nm) are embedded on two-dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon enriched with ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles. This composition boosts the electrochemical alkaline water-splitting reaction by showing overpotentials (eta(10)) of only 94 and 265 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, in an acidic medium, the eta(10) values are 107 and 330 mV for HER and OER, respectively; this suggests good bifunctionality at both lower and higher pH levels. Overall water splitting has been demonstrated by the developed catalyst at a cell voltage of 1.64 V for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, and a constant current is produced for more than 40 h under chronoamperometric conditions. This study describes the combination of two nanocomponents, with interconnected surface structures, which result in highly active and stable electrocatalytic performance.									47	0	0	0	2	0	47			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000451061000013	30232842

Firstly, a new cobalt-based metal-organic framework was prepared by using nitrogen-containing system. Then, a series of amorphous cobalt sulfide samples were prepared by changing curing time, temperature and sulfur sources, such as sodium sulfide and thioacetamide. The materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectra, and their structural characteristics were explained. The electrolysis performance of each sample was characterized in detail, and the structure-activity relationship of each system was established. Combined with various structural characterization and electrochemical performance tests, it was found that when the sulfuration temperature and sulfuration time were controlled to 60 degrees C and 6 h, respectively, the related samples exhibited the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction potential of 178 and 246 mV when the current density was 10 mA.cm(-2) in 1.0 mol.L-1 KOH solution, along with the excellent durability.

Here, we use a structural census in nearly 1,000 genomes and a molecular clock of folds to define a timeline of appearance of protein families linked to single-domain enzymes. The timeline sorts out enzymatic recruitment, validates patterns in metabolic history, and reveals that the most ancient reaction of aerobic metabolism involved the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate or pyridoxal and appeared 2.9 Gyr ago. The oxygen source for this primordial reaction was probably Mn catalase, which appeared at the same time and could have generated oxygen as a side product of hydrogen peroxide detoxification. Finally, evolutionary analysis of transferred groups and metabolite fragments revealed that oxidized sulfur did not participate in metabolism until the rise of oxygen. The evolutionary patterns we uncover in molecules and chemistries provide strong support for the coevolution of biochemistry and geochemistry.									39	2	0	0	34	0	44			0969-2126	1878-4186		WOS:000299195600008	22244756

Electrochemical and thermal splitting of water are promising techniques, but are highly energy demanding. Efficient hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts can play a key role to lower the electrolysis potential and to make water splitting more feasible. Among other perovskites, CaMnO3 has been identified as efficient electrode material due to its relatively high oxygen vacancy concentrations at elevated temperatures. But this compound needs to be further improved for technical use. In this study, the effect of Mn substitution in CaMnO3 by 3d metals M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn on the oxygen vacancy formation energy is investigated theoretically at DFT level. Vacancy formation energies, enthalpies and free enthalpies are calculated with a combination of hybrid and GGA density functionals. Configuration entropy is taken into account by calculating all possible configurations of M and oxygen vacancy site in supercell models. The calculated oxygen vacancy formation energies are strongly affected by Mn/M substitution, the most promising heteroelement being Cu. CaMn0.875Cu0.125O2.875 and CaMn0.875Cu0.125O2.75 are in equilibrium at 537 K, compared to 1231 K for CaMnO2.875/CaMnO2.75 and 1350 K for CaMnO3/CaMnO2.875.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0932-0776	1865-7117		WOS:000787390000001

The composition of the first anode is a Ti metal substrate coated with IrTaOx and overcoated with TiO2 (P-25) that was mixed with TiO2 nanogel, while the second anode consists of a Ti metal substrate coated with IrTaOx and an over-coating layer of La-doped sodium tantalate, NaTaO3: La. The experimental efficiencies for water splitting ranged from 62.4% to 67.5% for H-2 evolution and 40.6% to 60.0% for O-2 evolution. The corresponding over-potentials for the Ti/IrTa-TiO2 and Ti/IrTa-NaTaO3: La anodes coupled with stainless steel cathodes of the same dimensions were determined to be 437 mV and 367 mV for the OER, respectively, and 239 mV and 205 mV for RCS, respectively.

In this work, we use a two-dimensional (2D) MOF transformation strategy to synthesize FeNi layered double hydroxides (FeNi LDHs). 2D FeNi Hofmann MOFs ([Fe(L)(2)Ni(CN)(4)]) with a similar structure but different ligands (L = py, ISOQ) are synthesized as precursors. Accordingly, hydrolysis transformation assisted by NaBH4 leads to the growth of 2D FeNi-LDH nanosheets from 2D Hofmann-MOFs. During hydrolysis, OH- ions preferentially attack the coordination bond of [Fe(L)(2)Ni(CN)(4)], which allows FeNi-LDHs to form quickly on the surface of 2D MOFs. This rapid conversion process can effectively avoid the self-accumulation of LDHs. The hydrogen bubbles produced by NaBH4 can also inhibit the self-stacking of LDHs, which expose ample active species for the OER. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni contributes to the outstanding OER performance of FeNi-py-LDH, which shows an overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 22 mV dec(-1) and an excellent stability for 15 h. This work provides a universal synthesis method for ultra-thin FeNi-LDHs, which avoids the self-stacking of nanosheets and offers new insights into the OER.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000739081700001

In this paper, spinel CoFe2O4 (CFO) nanoparticles were successfully in situ grown onto rod-like ordered mesoporous carbon (RC) by a facile, scalable hydrothermal method, followed by annealing at different temperatures. The as-acquired CFO/RC nanohybrid pyrolyzed at 400 degrees C (CFO/RC-400) has a high specific surface area (150.3 m(2) g(-1)) and two sets of uniform mesopore systems (3.38 and 19.1 nm), all of which are favorable for the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity. The hybridization of CFO nanoparticles and the RC matrix results in increased ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity of the CFO/RC nanohybrids, which is significantly superior to that of unsupported CFO nanoparticles and pure RC. CFO/RC-400 shows better catalytic activity for the ORR with a direct four-electron reaction pathway than those prepared at other temperatures in terms of the onset potential and limiting current density. Furthermore, the CFO/RC-400 nanohybrid exhibits outstanding durability for both the ORR and OER, and can outperform commercial Pt/C. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities of the CFO/ RC nanohybrids are mainly owing to the hierarchical mesoporous structures of the nanohybrids and strong coupling between the CFO nanoparticles and the RC matrix.									80	3	0	0	3	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358211700030		
J	Chang Jing; Cui Dejie								Thermodynamic and Kinetic Analysis of Ca-Based Oxygen Carrier in Chemical-Looping Combustion								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING				8						A46					2010	2010	Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a promising technology to capture carbon dioxide (CO(2)) inherently and conveniently without the additional apparatus. At present, for some metal oxide oxygen carriers, the high costs and the positive hazards to the environment inhibit the developing of CLC systems. The feasibility of using CaSO(4) oxygen carrier in the CLC system is studied in this paper. Through the thermodynamic analysis, the carbon deposition and the sulfur evolution are studied in the reaction between CaSO(4) and a typical syngas. In addition, providing that hydrogen (H(2)) is fed as the gaseous fuel in the CLC system, the kinetic analysis is investigated on the reduction of CaSO(4) by H(2) and the oxidation of calcium sulfide (CaS) by oxygen (O(2)) through the thermo-gravimetric apparatus (TGA). The kinetic models are built on the reduction and the oxidation of the oxygen carrier. The results calculated from the models agree well with the experimental data. Finally, the possible reaction mechanisms for the reduction and the oxidation are explored.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1542-6580			WOS:000276232200021

The photocatalytic activity of the obtained defective BiOBr nanosheets was evaluated for the removal of rhodamine B (RhB), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and oxygen evolution from water. The as-prepared defective BiOBr nanosheets displayed significantly increased activity for pollutant degradation and oxygen evolution. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the improved light harvesting, suppression of charge recombination, and an increase in the number of active sites for photocatalytic reaction. The electronic structure of the defective BiOBr ultrathin nanosheets with confined pits has been tuned and thus varied the photocatalytic mechanism for pollutant degradation. The active species have changed from hole for BiOBr nanoplates to superoxide radical (O-2(.-)) and hole for defective BiOBr nanosheets determined by ESR analysis and trapping experiments.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2199-692X			WOS:000457501800012

Isolated single atomic sites coordinated with nitrogen on carbon supports (M-N-C) have promising performance for replacement of precious metal catalysts. However, most of monometallic M-N-C catalysts demonstrate unsatisfactory bifunctional performance. Herein, a facile way of preparing bimetallic Fe and Co sites entrapped in nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (Fe,Co-SA/CS) is explored, drawing on the unique structure and pore characteristics of Zeolitic imidazole frameworks and molecular size of Ferrocene, an Fe containing species. Fe,Co-SA/CS showed an ORR onset potential and half wave potential of 0.96 and 0.86 V, respectively. For OER, (Fe,Co)-SA/CS attained its anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 360 mV. Interestingly, the oxygen electrode activity (Delta E) for (Fe,Co)-SA/CS and commercial Pt/C-RuO(2)is calculated to be 0.73 V, exhibiting the bifunctional catalytic activity of (Fe,Co)-SA/CS. (Fe,Co)-SA/CS evidenced desirable specific capacity and cyclic stability than Pt/C-RuO2 mixture when utilized as an air cathode in a homemade Zinc-air battery.									105	2	0	0	5	0	104			2366-9608			WOS:000576256500001	34927885

The surface molecular structure of the films was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To determine the electro- and photoelectrochemical properties, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process was investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at pH = 13.6. It was found that Ru atoms were mainly in the metallic state (Ru-0) in the as-deposited films, whereas after the electrochemical stabilization, higher oxidation states, mainly Ru+4 (RuO2), were formed. The stabilized films exhibited high catalytic activity in OER-for the electrochemical process, the onset and eta(10) overpotentials were approx. 220 and 350 mV, respectively, while for the photoelectrochemical process, the pure photocurrent density of about 160 mA/cm(2) mg was achieved at 1.6 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). The plasma-deposited RuOX catalyst appears to be an interesting candidate for photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2073-4344		WOS:000523500100078

We find similar thermodynamics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates between the layers of oxyhydroxides, that is, in the bulk of the materials as on the (001) surface. The effect of interlayer spacing on adsorption energy is affected by both the crystal structure and the level of hydrogenation of the active sites. For the Fe-doped NiOOH, we observe general weakening of binding between the different OER intermediates and the catalyst material. The calculated OER activity depends both on doping and interlayer spacing, and our results are generally congruent with available experimental data. These results suggest that such interlayer " bulk" sites may contribute to measured OER activity for both the pure and Fe-doped NiOOH catalysts.									34	0	0	0	1	0	34			1011-372X	1572-879X		WOS:000401466600027

The synthesized PCN/BiOCl/CdS not only has the porous structure of PCN and the wide visible-light absorption range of CdS, but a special morphology and abundant oxygen vacancies of BiOCl under the action of the structure-directing agent ethylene glycol. Through the modulation of oxygen vacancies, the BiOCl in the PCN/BiOCl/CdS can be excited under visible light, thereby further improving its optical properties. The PCN/BiOCl/CdS exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity in oxidative coupling reaction of benzylamine under visible light. The excellent catalytic performance of PCN/BiOCl/CdS photocatalyst was due to high charge separation efficiency, oxygen vacancies and visible light absorption. Finally, we proposed a feasible photocatalytic mechanism for the PCN/BiOCl/CdS in oxidative coupling reaction of benzylamine.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1571-1013	1574-9266		WOS:000864991500001

To reduce the cost and provide an application of bifunctional catalysis, in this work, cobalt oxide supported on nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped carbon (Co3O4/NPC) was fabricated and examined as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for OER and ORR. To prepare Co3O4/NPC, NPC was pyrolyzed from melamine and phytic acid supported on carbon, followed by the solvothermal synthesis of Co3O4 on NPC. Linear sweep voltammetry was used to evaluate the activity for OER and ORR. For OER, Co3O4/NPC showed an onset potential of 0.54 V (versus the saturated calomel electrode) and a current density of 21.95 mA/cm(2) at 0.80 V, which was better than both Co3O4/C and NPC. The high activity of Co3O4/NPC was attributed to a synergistic effect of the N, P co-dopants and Co3O4. For ORR, Co3O4/NPC exhibited an activity close to commercial Pt/C in terms of the diffusion limited current density (-4.49 vs -4.76 mA/cm(2) at -0.80 V), and Co3O4 played the key role for the catalysis. Chronoamperometry (current versus time) was used to evaluate the stability, which showed that Co3O4/NPC maintained 46% current after the chronoamperometry test for OER and 95% current for ORR. Overall, Co3O4/NPC exhibited high activity and improved stability for both OER and ORR. (C) 2016, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

After the molybdenum source was introduced, the surface of the catalyst changed from a single-phase structure to a multiphase structure. The catalyst surface with enriched active sites and the synergistic effect of MoSe2 and Ni3Se2 together enhance the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER), the oxygen evolution reactions (OER), and electrocatalytic total water splitting activity of the catalyst. The overpotential of the MoSe2-Ni3Se2/NF electrocatalyst is only 259 mV and 395 mV at a current density of 100 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER, respectively. MoSe2-Ni3Se2/NF with a two-electrode system attains a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at 1.60 V. In addition, the overpotential of HER and OER of MoSe2-Ni3Se2/NF within 80000 s and the decomposition voltage of electrocatalytic total water decomposition hardly changed, showing an extremely strong stability. The improvement of MoSe2-Ni3Se2/NF catalytic activity is attributed to the establishment of the multi-phase structure and the optimized inoculation of the multi-component and multi-interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-1701	2095-1698		WOS:000759325800001

One of the biggest challenges for the large-scale application of water electrolysis is the searching of the low cost electrocatalysts with high and stable activity toward both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The well-developed porous features of materials synthesized from the earth abundant elements endow them with the enhanced mass transfer and improved electronic interconnection during electrochemical reactions, resulting in the excellent electrocatalytic performance for both OER and HER. Herein, this review focuses on the recent development of innovation strategies for the fabrication of porous non-noble-metal materials including heteroatom-doped carbon-based and transition metal (mainly Co, Ni, and Fe)based materials as efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting. Specially, a detailed discussion of the structure-activity correlation gives an insight on the origin of the high electrocatalytic performance of porous materials obtained from different strategies, and provides guidance for future design and preparation of highly efficient electocatalysts based on non-precious carbon or metal materials for overall water splitting.

Moreover, the electrochemical performance can be greatly enhanced by rational design of nanostructures. Herein, the hierarchical Co(OH)(2)@Ni(OH)(2) core-shell nanosheets on flexible carbon cloth (CC) were designed and prepared as advanced OER catalysts. Compared with the commercial RuO2, the Co(OH)(2)/CC and the Ni(OH)(2)/CC, the Co (OH)(2)@Ni(OH)(2)/CC hybrid electrode exhibits outstanding OER electrocatalytic activity with only similar to 330 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the Co(OH)(2)@Ni(OH)(2)/CC catalyst shows long-term durability without obvious degradation over 10 h. The outstanding electrochemical performance of the Co(OH)(2)@Ni(OH)(2)/CC could be attributed to the unique 3D hierarchical core-shell structure and the synergistic effect between Co(OH)(2) and Ni(OH)(2). Our work offers an effective strategy to prepare advanced electrode materials for OER electrocatalysts.									41	0	0	0	2	0	41			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000464931800150

A detailed understanding of the structural evolution of the materials is crucial to design high performance OCs for this technology. In this study, Fe2O3 particles were used as oxygen carrier to investigate the morphology and microstructure changes induced by redox reaction during chemical looping process, which were performed in the single and multiple redox cycles. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Hg intrusion method and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to characterize the changes in phase composition, pore size distribution and morphology.Our results indicated that the surface area of Fe2O3 particles decreased during the redox cycles even though more macro-pores ( > 1000 nm) formed for these particles. Sintering was attributed to the surface area decrease of Fe2O3 particles in the redox process. Because of the outward Fe cation diffusion, porous structure in the interior of Fe2O3 particles was formed, which led to the crushing strength of the OC particles decreased significantly. In the reduction process, the aggregation of unstable Fe2O3 could cause the surface sintering of OC particles in the transformation of Fe2O3 into Fe2O3. Such findings can not only explain the performance of iron based OCs in redox reaction, but can also provide theoretical guidance for the synthesis of iron-based OCs.									36	3	0	0	1	0	38			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000435619500025

An appropriate number of controllable oxygen vacancies (O-v) was generated in-situ on the surface of the WO3 nanoplates without deep defects by bidentate hydrogen bonds. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the distance between two alcoholic hydrogens (5.124 angstrom) in EG matches that of the diagonal oxygens (5.483 angstrom) in the WO3 (002) surface, which allows EG to combine through the most stable bidentate hydrogen bonds with O-H intervals of approximately 2.5 angstrom. Diagonal oxygens are captured directly from the surface, leaving O v owing to the special hydrogen-bond structure and moderate reducibility of EG under appropriate thermal conditions. The photocurrent density of the WO3-x nanoplates improves considerably to 2.07 from the 0.91 mA cm(-2) of pristine WO3 with the introduction of O-v, which demonstrates the superior surface reaction kinetics from the reduced holes-to-water resistance and increase in surface injection efficiency. DFT calculations of the oxygen evolution reaction reveal that surface O-v could substantially decrease the reaction energy barrier for a lower overpotential of 0.494 V compared to that of WO3 (1.037 V), which is consistent with the reduction in the Tafel slope from 412 to 243 mV dec(-1). Therefore, this study provides an innovative method to obtain an efficient WO3 photoanode based on the treatment of EG.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000608700000003

J	Li, Shicheng; Liang, Hongyan; Li, Chong; Liu, Yongchang								Lattice mismatch in Ni3Al-based alloy for efficient oxygen evolution								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				106				19	27		10.1016/j.jmst.2021.08.013				APR 20 2022	2022	The Ni3Al-based alloy has been considered as a robust catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its long-term durability and acceptable activity. However, related reports about understanding the catalytic mechanism are rare and desirable. Herein, the effect of gamma/gamma' phase lattice mismatch on the catalytic performance caused by various cooling rates after solution heat treatment was investigated. With decreasing cooling rate, the morphologies of gamma' precipitates transformed from sphere to cube and the lattice mismatch increased from -0.172% to -0.409%. The increased lattice mismatch facilitated the formation of the active beta-NiOOH phase and enhanced the intrinsic catalytic activity, resulting in the optimized OER overpotential of 240 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 66.1 mV dec(-1) and a stability of 200 h in 1 M KOH. This work reveals the lattice mismatch effect on OER and provides a potential candidate for OER.

Herein, we report a novel and robust material comprised of nickel-cobalt nanoparticles coated on a porous nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) thin film synthesized via a two-step pulsed laser deposition technique. The optimized sample (Ni0.5Co0.5/NC) achieved the lowest overpotentials of 176 mV and 300 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The optimized OER activity might be attributed to the available metal oxide nanoparticles with an effective electronic structure configuration and enhanced mass/charge transport capability. At the same time, the porous nitrogen doped carbon incorporated with cobalt and nickel species can serve as an excellent HER catalyst. As a result, the newly developed electrocatalysts manifest high current densities and strong electrochemical stability in overall water splitting, outperforming most of the previously reported non-precious metal-based catalysts.									48	1	0	0	0	0	48			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000387858400029	27782269

Facile preparation is realized in the case of no added metal source via dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) microplasma under 10 min, and the thickness of the nanosheet is only 6.5 nm. The prepared ultrathin CuO nanosheets on copper foam (CuO UTNS/CF) display a catalytic activity of 262 mV overpotential (eta) at 10 mA cm-2 for the OER in alkaline media. The as-prepared electrocatalyst guarantees appealing long-term durability (>90 h) and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.488 mol O2 s-1 at 426 mV. Compared to CuO/CF prepared traditionally, the overpotential of CuO UTNS/CF can be directly reduced to 38 mV. Moreover, hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) were identified as the intermediate products and a possible synthesis mechanism was preliminarily put forward. As a facile technology for the OER catalyst, we believe that DBD microplasma will provide a broad perspective for researchers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000866239200001

The desired electrocatalyst was prepared by covalent attachment of ionic liquid (IL) species to graphene oxide for preparing IL-GO and then electrostatic interaction of supported imidazolium cations with Keggin type [CoW12O40](6-)polyanions. After confirming the construction of CoW12-IL-GO with different physicochemical techniques, its electrochemical properties was evaluated. The CoW12-IL-GO exhibited a low onset potential of 1.3 V vs. NHE and low overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 92 mV.dec(-1) at neutral pH. Eventually, the electrocatalytic activity of prepared CoW12-IL-GO was studied in water oxidation reaction which revealed its outstanding stability over 14 h and retention of catalytic activity even after 900 catalytic cycles.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000720946000001

For practical utilizations, lowering the overpotential and improving the stability of electrocatalysts for the OER are highly important. However, the particular roles of active sites and their surrounding moieties in these catalysts, especially in an aqueous system during the reaction (in situ working conditions), are still ambiguous. Thanks to the well-developed techniques of X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy based on a synchrotron light source, the local structural transformation of these catalysts can be evidently revealed by in situ experiments. Herein, the research on 3d transition metal oxides and chalcogenides used for the OER is enumerated with their corresponding in situ characterization and electrochemical (EC) performances. We generalize the universality of phase transition in the catalysts from the pristine/as-prepared structure to the specific active species during the OER and propose a synergistic effect between the active sites and subsidiary sites on the surface of the catalysts.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000605665900004	33300022

Herein, a novel substrate-seeding secondary-growth strategy is developed to prepare composites of uniform MOFs films on aerogel walls. Briefly, the organic ligand is "pre-seeded" onto the aerogel walls, and then a small amount of metal-ion solution is sprayed onto the prepared aerogel. The sprayed solution diffuses along the aerogel walls to form a continuous thin layer, which confines the nucleation reaction, promoting the formation of uniform MOFs films on the aerogel walls. The whole process is simple in operation, highly efficient, and eco-friendly. The resulting hierarchical MOFs/aerogel composites have abundant accessible active sites and enable excellent mass transfer, which endows the composite with outstanding catalytic activity and stability in both liquid-phase CO2 cycloaddition and electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process.									57	2	0	0	5	0	57			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000587499300001	32975866

The as-prepared composite bifunctional catalyst is confirmed to possess a structure of N-GC/Co@ CoO/rGO, with core-shell nanoparticles of Co@ CoO encapsulated in nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon (N-GC) thin layers which are then overall supported by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets. With N-GC furnishing high population of ORR active sites, CoO being active for OER which is further enhanced by a highly conductive metal core, rGO sheets enhancing the overall electronic conduction, as well as the multiple synergistic couplings in the composite materials, pronounced ORR and OER catalytic activities with superior stability have been achieved. The catalysts also showed excellent tolerance to the crossover effect to methanol, showing great potential in energy-related applications requiring efficient oxygen electrocatalysis.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17				2046-2069		WOS:000470753700028	35516369

Herein, We report the synthesis of sulphur doped iron cobalt oxide nanocaterpillars (FCS) and their utilization in supercapatteries and for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). These nanocaterpillars (FCS) demonstrate a high specific capacitance of 1809 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) along with an exceptional stability of 138% after 15,000 cycles in alkaline media. Considering them in the fabrication of a supercapattery (with iron cobalt oxide (FCO) as a negative electrode), we achieve an ultrahigh energy density of 140Wh kg(-1) at 1434 W kg(-1) with an excellent cycling stability (95% till 5000 cycles). To our surprise, it even outshines as an electrocatalyst (OER) attaining a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 300 mV. As a consequence of the extremely high roughness factor (R-f = 1135) these nanocaterpillars deliver a best Tafel slope of 56 mV/dec. Henceforth, these sulphur doped iron cobalt oxide nanocaterpillars (FCS) display enormous potential in storing and converting energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a novel electrocatalyst, comprising few-layered graphitic carbon (similar to 5 atomic layers) encapsulated heazlewoodite (Ni3S2@C) nanoparticles (NPs), was designed and synthesized using a one-step solid phase pyrolysis method. In the OER test, the Ni3S2@C catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 298 mV at a current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 51.3 mV center dot dec(-1), and charge transfer resistance of 22.0 Omega, which were better than those of benchmark RuO2 and most nickel-sulfide-based catalysts previously reported. This improved performance was ascribed to the high electronic conductivity of the graphitic carbon encapsulating layers. Moreover, the encapsulation of graphitic carbon layers provided superb stability without noticeable oxidation or depletion of Ni3S2 NPs within the nanocomposite. Therefore, the strategy introduced in this work can benefit the development of highly stable metal sulfide electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications, without sacrificing electrocatalytic activity.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000410304500023

Therefore, development of a noble metal-free, efficient and robust electrocatalyst simultaneously towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is still a great challenge. Herein, an ultrafast and scalable method was introduced to synthesize CoSx non-layered and freestanding nanosheets via microwave-assisted liquid-phase growth of a Co(OH)(2) precursor post-sulfurized at room temperature. The planar sheet area was up to several micrometres and exhibited an ultrathin thickness (<1 nm) with a mesoporous feature. Hence, the highly exposed surface atoms afforded high electrochemical activity, whereas the ultrathin and mesoporous features facilitated charge and mass transfer along the 2D nanostructure to efficiently perform the surface-dependent electrochemical reactions: HER, OER, and the overall water splitting. Notably, the amorphous CoSx presented a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 127 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. During the OER process, the surface of Co9S8 (annealed CoSx) was mainly in situ oxidized to form CoOOH; this suggested CoOOH/Co9S8 as the real form of the catalyst that exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 288 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2). Impressively, the assembled overall water electrolyzer required a cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH with excellent stability. Predominantly, our synthesis strategy is cost-effective and scalable to break the synthesis challenge of transition-metal-sulfide ultrathin nanosheets with high quality and suggests a possibility for commercial applications.									78	9	0	0	2	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000431621700032

Herein, a one-pot hydrothermal method is reported to self-assemble the cobalt sulfides (CoS2, Co9S8 and Co3S4) with hollow nanostructures. The whole preparation process is simple and mild, avoiding high temperature calcination. The performances of the three kinds of cobalt sulfide in superior supercapacitors and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance applications follow the order of CoS2 > Co9S8 > Co3S4. Further analysis demonstrates that the performance difference in these cobalt sulfides may be attributed to three factors: the presence of S-2(2-), <i the coordination environment of Co and the presence of continuous network of Co-Co bonds. The distinctive electrochemical performance of CoS2 and Co9S8 may help us to better understand the excellent electrochemical activity of metal polysulfides and metal sulfides after doping or alloying. Therefore, this work may provide a reference in understanding and designing the electrode materials for highly efficient applications in the fields of energy storage and conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000667506400001	34107464

A better understanding of both the OER mechanism and the degradation mechanism on different transition metal (TM) oxides is critical for the development of the, next generation of oxides as OER catalysts. In this paper, we systematically investigated the catalytic mechanism and lifetime of ABO(3-delta) perovskite catalysts for the OER, where A = Sr or Ca and B = Fe or Co. During the OER process, the Fe-based AFeO(3-delta) oxides with (delta approximate to 0.5 demonstrate no activation of lattice oxygen or pH dependence of the OER activity, which is different from the SrCoO25 with similar oxygen 2p-band position relative to the Fermi level. The difference was attributed to the larger changes in the electronic structure during the transition from the oxygen-deficient brownmillerite structure to the fully oxidized perovskite structure and the poor conductivity in Fe-based oxides, which hinders the uptake of oxygen from the electrolyte to the lattice under oxidative potentials. The low stability of Fe-based perovskites under OER conditions in a basic electrolyte also contributes to the different OER mechanism compared with the Co-based perovskites. This work reveals the influence of TM composition and electronic structure on the catalytic mechanism and operational stability of the perovskite OER catalysts.									76	6	0	0	5	0	76			1932-7447			WOS:000430896500046

This work showcases advanced nanoscale microscopy techniques supported by complementary structural and chemical characterization to develop a fundamental understanding of stability in promising SrIrO3 thin film electrocatalyst materials. Cross-sectional high-resolution transmission electron microscopy illustrates atomic-scale bulk and surface structure, while secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging using a helium ion microscope provides the nanoscale lateral elemental distribution at the surface. After accelerated degradation tests under anodic potential, the SrIrO3 film thins and roughens, but the lateral distribution of Sr and Ir remains homogeneous. A layer-wise dissolution mechanism is hypothesized, wherein anodic potential causes the IrOx-rich surface to dissolve and be regenerated by Sr leaching. The characterization approaches utilized herein and mechanistic insights into SrIrO3 are translatable to a wide range of catalyst systems.									4	0	0	0	0	0	3			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000662722100001

Herein, well-monodispersed InOOH nanoparticles (NPs) tailored by Fe doping with diameters of about 7 nm are synthesized by using a two-phase colloidal method and secondary solvothermal process. Benefiting from the large electrochemically active surface area given by the unique monodispersed NP morphology, the increased active sites generated by tunable Fe doping that can increase the OER activity of the host oxide, and the synergistic effect between In and Fe, Fe-doped InOOH NPs exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity toward the OER. As a result, well-monodispersed Fe-doped InOOH NPs could achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)at overpotentials of 220 mV and 266 mV, respectively, in alkaline media (1.0 M KOH), and possess an excellent catalytic durability of 27 hours, transcending most of the previously reported Fe-rich OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000567493200001

However, the battery performance is limited by the inferior electrocatalytic activity of catalysts in the cathode. In this work, MoSe2 catalysts with hybrid 1T and 2H phases were prepared through an efficient two-step hydrothermal strategy. The combination of the 1T phase with the 2H phase could synergically enhance the catalytic activities towards both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, and the built-in heterojunction between them also dramatically facilitated the interfacial charge transfer kinetics. Additionally, the hierarchical flower-like architecture with multidimensional channels would promote the rapid electron and mass diffusion, as well as provide enough space for storing discharge products. Thanks to the above merits, MoSe2 cathodes delivered improved electrocatalytic properties for Li-O-2 batteries. This present work may pave a new avenue for highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst construction for Li-O-2 batteries.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000669584500001

Among the phenomena that can be studied through the oxygen isotope ratios are the maximum depth of penetration of the convective envelopes on the giant branch, the efficiency of nonconvective mixing, as well as restrictions on the mass loss that occurs. The oxygen isotope ratios also provide an indicator of the nuclear processing that occurs during third dredge up and carbon star formation. In addition to the oxygen isotopes, we indicate the expected behavior of nitrogen and the light elements.									57	0	0	0	0	0	57			0370-1573			WOS:A1992HD15900001

They are closely interconnected in the catabolism of reactive oxygen species because one product of SOD reaction (hydrogen peroxide) is the main substrate of CAT reaction finally leading to harmless products (i.e., molecular oxygen and water). It is therefore interesting to compare the molecular evolution of corresponding gene families. We have used a phylogenomic approach to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among these two main enzymatic antioxidants with a focus on the genomes of thermophilic fungi. Distinct gene families coding for CuZnSODs, FeMnSODs, and heme catalases are very abundant in thermophilic Ascomycota. Here, the presented results demonstrate that whereas superoxide dismutase genes remained rather constant during long-term evolution, the total count of heme catalase genes was reduced in thermophilic fungi in comparison with their mesophilic counterparts. We demonstrate here, for the newly discovered ascomycetous genes coding for thermophilic superoxide dismutases and catalases (originating from our sequencing project), the expression patterns of corresponding mRNA transcripts and further analyze translated protein sequences. Our results provide important implications for the physiology of reactive oxygen species metabolism in eukaryotic cells at elevated temperatures.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6				2076-3921		WOS:000592709800001	33120873

The catalytic performance for MoO2 is essential to be mediated by tailoring its shape, size, and composition. Here, we develop a simple approach to realize shape and size control of P-MoO2-Fe3O4 nanobelts with 150-230 nm in diameter, inheriting from alpha-MoO3 nanobelts. Surface structure analysis reveals doping of P into MoO2-Fe3O4, generation of interfacial structure between MoO2-Fe3O4, and defective structures. At 10 mA/cm2, P-MoO2-Fe3O4 nanobelts achieve superior oxygen evolution reactivity with 270 mV to RuO2 with 319 mV and exhibit higher hydrogen generation activity (200 mV) compared with P-MoO2 nanobelts (250 mV) and P-Fe3O4 nanosheets (220 mV). The unique structures with interface of MoO2- Fe3O4 and defective sites for P-MoO2-Fe3O4 nanobelts promote overall water splitting reactivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000874672300001

Unlike conventional alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE), AEMWEs utilize mild alkaline conditions and anion exchange membranes as separators and ionic conductors, respectively. However, the largest merit of AEMWE is the utilization of low-cost transition metals as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Achieving excellent AEMWE performance using highly active and robust transition metal electrocatalysts is desired for lowering the fabrication cost and realizing the successful commercialization of AEMWE. Water splitting efficiency in the AEMWE largely depends on the kinetics of the HER and OER catalysts. Such a condition requires proper understanding of the reaction mechanisms, careful design and optimization of catalyst materials, and maintenance of catalyst durability under AEMWE conditions during long-term operation. This review discussed recent transition metal HER, OER, and bifunctional water splitting electrocatalysts applied within the actual AEMWE membrane electrode assembly (MEA), where their influence toward the electrolyzer cell performance is highlighted. Additionally, the MEA fabrication methods are briefly addressed. From the review, potential electrocatalyst materials and remaining challenges are identified to provide for future improvements on the AEMWE system.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000709608000001

However, the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics on the air cathode limit their efficiency and the development of highly efficient, low cost and stable bifunctional electrocatalysts is still challenging. Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts have been demonstrated as promising alternative catalysts due to the regular structure, tunable chemistry, high specific surface area, and simple and easy preparation of MOFs, and great progress has been made in this area. Herein, we summarize the latest research progress of MOF-based bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for ZABs, including pristine MOFs, derivatives of MOFs and MOF composites. The effects of the catalysts' composites, morphologies, specific surface areas and active sites on catalytic performances are specifically addressed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for different catalytic activity of MOF based catalysts. Finally, the main challenges and prospects for developing advanced MOF-based bifunctional electrocatalysts are proposed.									26	2	0	0	1	0	27			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000588192000001	34094409

This proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) model shows reasonable barriers. Because in experiments excess oxidants (OCl- or HSO5-) are required to evolve oxygen from water, we considered the Mn-2 complex neutralized by three counterions. Structure optimization made the coordinated OCl- withdraw a H+ from the water ligand and produces the reaction space for H2O2 formation with the deprotonated OH- ligand. The reaction barrier for the H2O2 formation from OH- and protonated OCl- depends significantly on the system charge and is 14.0 kcal/mol when the system is neutralized. The H2O2 decomposes to O-2 during two PCET processes to the Mn-2 complex, both with barriers lower than 12.0 kcal/mol. In both PCET processes the spin moment of transferred electrons prefers to be parallel to that of Mn 3d electrons because of the exchange interaction. This model thus explains how the triplet O-2 molecule is produced.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1089-5639			WOS:000305933700015	22672069

In this work, we showed that stabilization of the internally generated oxygen evolution reaction (OER) active phase (oxyhydroxide) is crucial for ZnCo2O4 electrocatalysts. A systematic evaluation of the bulk and nanostructured ZnCo2O4 system concomitant with nanostructured Co3O4 showed that leaching of Zn is the driving force behind the near-surface transformation to the oxyhydroxide phase. The relative contribution to this near-surface reconstruction was found to be surface-sensitive. The electrochemical observations combined with Raman and impedance spectroscopy revealed that the good catalytic activity could be attributed to the formation of the cobalt oxyhydroxide phase, which was created by the dissolution of Zn from the nanostructured surface. Moreover, this study sheds light on previous contradicting postulates regarding the discrepancy of the OER activity of ZnCo2O4. Our finding regarding the formation of the OER active phase in spinel Zn-Co oxide will motivate researchers to focus more on the near-surface reconstruction behavior of cobalt-based oxide electrocatalysts in the future.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400028	35319178

Herein, nickel hydroxide/reduced graphene oxide (Ni(OH)(2)/rGO) composite thin film was fabricated using dip-coating followed by electrodeposition method on Ni foam substrate at room temperature. The deposited composite film shows amorphous nature with ultra-thin Ni(OH)(2)nanosheets vertically coated on rGO surface, which provides large electrochemical surface area and abundant catalytically active sites. It exhibits a low overpotential of 260 mV @10 mA cm(-2)as compared to the pristine electrodes and excellent long-term stability up to 20 hours in 1 M KOH solution. The electrochemical active surface area and Tafel slope of the composite electrode are 20.2 mF cm(-2)and 35 mV dec(-1), respectively.

However, current AEM electrolyzers still employ noble-metal-containing electrocatalysts, or have significant overpotential loss, or both. Here non-noble-metal electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) are developed. Both catalysts are made of a same NiMo oxide. Judicious processing of these materials in a mixed NH3/H(2)atmosphere results in a NiMo-NH3/H(2)catalyst, which has superior activity in HER, delivering 500 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 107 mV. Doping Fe ions into the NiMo-NH3/H(2)catalyst yields an Fe-NiMo-NH3/H(2)catalyst, which is highly active for the OER, delivering 500 mA cm(-2)at an overpotential of 244 mV. These catalysts are integrated into an AEM electrolyzer, which delivers 1.0 A cm(-2)at 1.57 V at 80 degrees C in 1mKOH. The energy conversion efficiency at this current density is as high as 75%.

In this Perspective, we scrutinize the reports on the best-performing CO2 electrolyzer cells from the past 5 years, to shed light on the role of the anodic oxygen evolution catalyst. We analyze how different cell architectures provide different local chemical environments at the anode surface, which in turn determines the pool of applicable anode catalysts. We uncover the factors that led to either a strikingly high current density operation or an exceptionally long lifetime. On the basis of our analysis, we provide a set of criteria that have to be fulfilled by an anode catalyst to achieve high performance. Finally, we provide an outlook on using alternative anode reactions (alcohol oxidation is discussed as an example), resulting in high-value products and higher energy efficiency for the overall process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000740452700001	35096466

The structure of as-prepared NiSe/Ni/NC are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron micrographs, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. In 1 M KOH electrolyte, as-prepared NiSe/Ni/NC delivers an overpotential of 77 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 321 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the current density of 10 mAcm(-2). During the OER, NiSe/Ni/NC exhibits a better electrocatalytic performance compared to the state-of-the-art RuO2. Furthermore, when NiSe/Ni/NC is used as the water splitting, the potential can reach 1.6 V at 10 mAcm(-2). The high HER and OER catalytic activity of NiSe/Ni/NC originates from the mesoporous carbon matrix and synergetic effect between Ni, NiSe and the carbon matrix. In addition, when NiSe/Ni/NC is used as a bi-functional catalyst for HER and OER in alkaline media, it shows superior electrochemical performance to many other nickel selenide-based catalysts reported in the literature.

Herein, we report a step-wise polymerization and carbonization route to prepare N-doped hollow carbon nanoflowers (N-HCNFs) with a high nitrogen content up to 5.3 at%. A preformed covalent triazine framework (CTF) network assembled on a melamine-cyanuric acid (MCA) supermolecular crystal was achievedviaa step-wise polymerization. The subsequent carbonization was conducted to obtain hollow and porous carbon materials with a unique flower-shape. Excellent electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance with a positive half-wave potential of 0.84 V (vs.RHE) was achieved with excellent stability and methanol resistance in alkaline media. Furthermore, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a low overpotential of 243 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a small Tafel slope of 111 mV dec(-1)in acidic media were shown.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000549588900004	32614348	
J	He, Jing; Fu, Gang; Zhang, Jiaxu; Xu, Ping; Sun, Jianmin								Multistage Electron Distribution Engineering of Iridium Oxide by Codoping W and Sn for Enhanced Acidic Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis								SMALL				18	41					2203365	10.1002/smll.202203365		SEP 2022		OCT 2022	2022	Developing efficient and robust anodic electrocatalysts to implement the proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is critical for hydrogen generation. Nevertheless, the only known applicable anode catalyst IrOx in PEM electrolyzers still requires high overpotential due to the weak binding energy between oxygen intermediates and active sites, limiting its wide applications. Herein, a ternary Ir0.2W0.2Sn0.1Ox nanocatalyst synthesized through a sol-gel strategy, exhibits a low overpotential of 236 mV (10 mA cm(geo)(-2)) for thoxygen evolution reaction (OER), accompanied with robust durability over 220 h at 1 A cm(geo)(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4. Moreover, the optimized Ir0.2W0.2Sn0.1Ox delivers a prominent mass activity of 722.7 A g(Ir)(-1) at 1.53 V (vs RHE), which is around 34 times higher compared with that of IrOx. The mircrostructural analyses reveal that codoping of W and Sn stabilizes Ir with a valence state lower than 4+ through multistage charge redistribution, avoiding the overoxidation of Ir above 1.6 V versus RHE and enhancing the acidic OER performance. Additionally, density functional theory calculations reveal that codoping of W and Sn moves the d band center of Ir to the Fermi level, thus enhancing the binding energies of oxygen intermediates with Ir sites and decreasing the energy barrier toward acidic OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000852591500001	36089667

Herein, we develop a simplistic two-step annealing strategy to synthesize the hierarchical Co/MoO2@nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanosheets (CMO@NC) electrocatalysts derived from the low-cost and sustainable lotus leaves biomass for water-splitting. The optimum catalyst (CMO@NC/450) exhibits a notable low overpotential of 130 and 272 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, owing to their unique surface features, large surface area, abundant meso/micropores, and high pyridinic N-contents. Also, the CMO@NC/450 catalyst-equipped with a two-electrode configuration exhibits notable water splitting activity only requires a cell-potential of 1.629 V@10 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH. The results reveal that hierarchical flower-like morphology increases the contact area, prevents aggregation, and enables massive active-sites for HER and OER. Additionally, the synergistic effects between Co/MoO2 and the N-doped-carbon heterostructure enhance charge-delocalization, ultimately improving electrocatalytic performance and stability. This work is aimed to promote the exploration and design of suitable doping structures and compositions for the development of highly effective and sustainable biomass-derived catalysts in a wide-range of electrochemical applications.

This procedure doesn't require harsh environment such as temperature and pressure and the simple process offers a great possibility for mass production of polymer nanoparticles. The obtained PPy/ IL nanoparticles were tested as an electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. We have not added any transition metal or metal oxide. But, the as-prepared catalyst has ionic liquid which containing 1-allyl-3-methylpyridinium cation and tetrachloronickelate anion complex. The as-prepared catalyst PPy/ IL nanoparticles showed the Tafel slope of 53mVdec(-1). High catalytic activity of PPy/ IL for OER is evident from low onset potential of 516mV (.1= 328mV) and high current density observed in the polarization curve. Moreover, the as-prepared catalyst achieved current density of 10mA cm(-2) at low potential of only 583mV which corresponds to an overpotential of only 392mV.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000430700500023

Here, a novel flower-like Co-Ni alloy was fabricated on the polyimide-carbon nanotube (PI-CNT) film by the double step potential deposition method. The nanostructure of Co-Ni alloy and the underlying PI/CNT film result a great catalytic OER performance of Co-Ni/PI-CNT film. The obtained results indicated Co-Ni(1:1)/PI-CNT film performed the best electrocatalytic property comparing with that of the Co-Ni/PI-CNT films with other atomic ratio. Besides, the deposition times played an important role to effect the OER activity of films and the research confirmed the Co-Ni(100s)/PI-CNT film was the best one. The prepared Co-Ni(1:1,100s)/PI-CNT film exhibited an earlier onset potential about 1.50 V and a small Tafel slope of 59 mV/decade. The facile electrodeposition synthesis of such efficient catalyst based on mixed-metals provides a new way for the rational design of high-performance catalyst for water splitting.

This in-situ gas chromatography technique monitoring the gas evolution during electrochemical reaction presents opportunities to clearly understand the effect of surface modification and predict on the cathode stability. The oxide cathode, 0.5Li(2)MnO(3)center dot 0.5LiNi(0.4)Co(0.2)Mn(0.4)O(2), surface modified by amorphous cobalt-phosphate nanoparticles (a-CoPO4) is prepared by a simple co-precipitation reaction followed by a mild heat treatment. The presence of a 40 nm thick a-CoPO4 coating layer wrapping the oxide powders is confirmed by electron microscopy. The electrochemical measurements reveal that the a-CoPO4 coated overlithiated layered oxide cathode shows better performances than the pristine counterpart. The enhanced performance of the surface modified oxide is attributed to the uniformly coated Co-P-O layer facilitating the suppression of O-2 evolution and offering potential lithium host sites. Further, the formation of a stable SEI layer protecting electrolyte decomposition also contributes to enhanced stabilities with lesser voltage decay. The in-situ gas chromatography technique to study electrode safety offers opportunities to investigate the safety issues of a variety of nanostructured electrodes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000372530800001	27001370

As Ir-based compositions are regarded to show better resistance to acidic environments than any other transition metals, a surge of research on many complex iridates recently has been carried out. However, the intrinsic structure-property relationship in iridates remains elusive, although several examples showing exceptional OER activity were reported. Here we discover that eleven different A(x)Ir(y)O(z)-type oxides (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Y, Pr, Nd) with high OER activity can be categorized into three distinct groups in terms of the [IrO6] connection geometry. Furthermore, a notable common correlation among the crystal structure, activity variation, and stability during the OER is identified in each of the groups. If the iridates consist of a strong edge- or facesharing [IrO6] configuration, their stability and activity are preserved during a remarkably large number of anodic cycles. In addition to comparing the OER performance between many high-activity iridates, our findings emphasize that the [IrO6] connectivity is a crucial structural factor governing the overall longevity of Ir-based catalysts.									40	0	0	0	2	0	40			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000589801000038

The coke deposits were formed over three different catalysts 1 wt.% Pt/Al2O3, MnO2/CeO2 and 1 wt.% Pt-MnO2/CeO2 during phenol deep oxidation in a three-phase slurry reactor at various reaction conditions (exposure time, temperature, oxygen pressure, catalyst loading). The carbon oxides, oxygen and water fluxes arising from the combustion of the carbonaceous deposits in a 5% O-2/He mixture, were continuously monitored. In all cases, unimodal quasi-Gaussian distributions were obtained for CO2 while no CO was detected. These evolutions were successfully described by a modified "fractal power-law" grain model. The coke-dependence of the carbon dioxide profiles was related to the fractal dimension of the catalyst surface and to the oxygen partial order during coke burn-off. The corresponding change in O-2 partial order was ascribed to competition between three steps in the combustion mechanism: non-dissociative O-2 chemisorption, interaction of oxygen with undissociated dioxygen bearing surface species, physical desorption of the complex oxide as carbon dioxide.

Three kinds of powers A, B, C were prepared by chemically coprecipitating Ni, Co, Zn, Ca, Mg and Cu. It was found that powder B produced better performance than the others. The discharge capacities of powder B could achieve 280 mAh g(-1) for both 1C and 2C rates at 65 degrees C, respectively. The cyclic voltammetry analysis showed that the difference between the oxidation potential and the oxygen evolution potential of powder B is 122 mV. It indicated that Co could improve conductivity of electrons, restrict the oxygen evolution reaction and thus promote the high rate charge/discharge and high-temperature performance. Ca and Mg might effectively enhance the oxygen evolution potential in the charge process. Furthermore, the proper addition of Zn, Ca and Cu could lower the ionization energy and elevated the transition energy, and thus the transfer of electrons in electrode materials was accelerated and the electrochemical performance of nickel hydroxide electrode was improved. It was a promising way to improve the electrochemical performance of spherical nickel hydroxide for Ni-MH batteries.

Herein, we compare the OER performance of the two different crystal phase iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3 and gamma-Fe2O3). The iron oxide yolk-shell microspheres were facile realized via one-step solvothermal method and the subsequent annealing treatment. An interesting phenomenon is present that alpha-Fe2O3 yolk-shell microspheres with a smaller specific surface area have better OER performance than that of gamma-Fe2O3 yolk-shell microspheres. The crystal structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that alpha-Fe2O3 yolk-shell microspheres have better electrocatalytic activity, which is due to the presence of more Fe active sites (Fe3+) exposured on the surface. These Fe active sites are beneficial to enhance the adsorption of hydroxyl groups in water molecules, leading to a higher OER performance. As an application example, the Fe2O3 yolk-shell microspheres are employed as an efficient OER electrocatalyst, showing the interdependence between phase and OER behavior.									14	3	0	0	1	0	15			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000580616900011

Herein, a unique strategy to remarkably boost electrocatalytic OER activity of one Ni-based MOF is developed by the simultaneous incorporation of Fe3+ ions and BF4- anions within its layer structure. The optimized electrocatalyst NiFe-MOF-BF4--0.3 NSs shows superior OER activity with a required ultralow overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1), and outstanding stability in an alkaline medium. The experimental and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results verify that the interactions between metal (M) ions and BF4- anions (defined as M...F, M = Ni or Fe) in this catalyst can adjust the adsorption abilities of oxygen intermediates and lower the free energy barrier of the potential-determining step by tailoring its electronic structure, thereby remarkably boosting its OER activity. This protocol provides new insights into surface and structure engineering of 2D MOFs, leading to greatly enhanced electrocatalytic OER performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000800295400025	35324163

In this work, hierarchical dendrite-like CO0.75Ni0.2 alloy prepared by a simple hydrothermal reduction route can serve as a high-performance catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect from Co and Ni atoms optimizes the catalytic behavior of their alloy, and the hierarchical dendrite structure enlarges the contact area with the electrolyte, exposing more active sites. Based on the dendrite-like CO0.75Ni0.2 alloy, we further fabricate a core-shell architecture with the conductive N-doped carbon shell coated dendrite-like CoNi/CoNiO2 nanocomposites via a calcination process at 600 degrees C (CoNi/CoNiO2@NC-600). The dendrite-like CoNi/CoNiO2@ NC-600 displays significantly improved activity of oxygen evolution reaction due to large active surface area, high conductivity, and the continuous electron transfer among metal, metal oxide, and N-doped carbon. Furthermore, the dendrite-like CO0.75Ni0.2 alloy and CoNi/CoNiO2@NC-600 are assembled into a water splitting electrolyzer with a low voltage of 1.51 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2).									68	2	0	0	2	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000472697500064

Among the different candidates, Ni-Fe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) hold great promise due to their high activity closely approaching or even outperforming that of the precious metal benchmark in alkaline media. Here, we show that their activity can be further promoted when forming ultrathin LDH nanosheets intercalated with molybdate ions via an exfoliation-free hydrothermal method. In 1 M KOH, these nanosheets exhibit about 3-fold higher OER current density than regular NiFe LDH nanosheets, which was believed to be mostly contributed by their higher available density of electrochemically active sites associated with the ultrathin thickness. The great activity is also accompanied by remarkable durability at different current density levels. Finally, we demonstrate that these ultrathin nanosheets can also be directly grown on Ni foam for achieving significant current densities.									169	16	0	0	4	1	172			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358722200067

Noble-metal-free catalysts containing Co(Fe)NC moieties have been widely reported in recent years for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction and have also gained noticeable interest for organic transformation. However, to date, no prior studies are available in the literature about the activity of N-coordinated metal centers for photocatalytic H-2 evolution. Herein, a new photocatalyst containing g-C3N4 decorated with CoP nanodots constructed from low-cost precursors is reported. It is for the first time revealed that the unique P((-))Co((+))N((-)) surface bonding states lead to much superior H-2 evolution activity (96.2 mu mol h(-1)) compared to noble metal (Pt)-decorated g-C3N4 photocatalyst (32.3 mu mol h(-1)). The quantum efficiency of 12.4% at 420 nm is also much higher than the record values (approximate to 2%) of other transition metal cocatalysts-loaded g-C3N4. It is believed that this work marks an important step toward developing high-performance and low-cost photocatalytic materials for H-2 evolution.									353	18	0	0	38	0	357			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394671200014

Real electrochemical systems, however, operate at constant potential, which corresponds to a hypothetical model system of infinite size. Previous studies of hydrogen evolution have relied on a computationally costly scheme that extrapolates the barriers calculated on increasingly larger cells, and extension of this scheme to more complex reactions would be prohibitively costly. We present a new method to determine constant potential reaction energetics for simple charge transfer reactions that requires only (1) a single barrier calculation in an electrochemical environment and (2) the corresponding surface charge at the initial, transition, and final states. This method allows for a tremendous reduction in the computational resources required to determine electrochemical barriers and paves the way for a rigorous DFT-based kinetic analysis of electrochemical reactions beyond hydrogen evolution.									210	4	0	0	14	0	210			1948-7185			WOS:000358339600001	26266844	
J	Kose, Kadir Ozgun; Aydinol, Mehmet Kadri								Development of activated carbon/bimetallic transition metal phosphide composite materials for electrochemical capacitors and oxygen evolution reaction catalysis								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESEARCH											10.1002/er.8710		SEP 2022			2022	Pinecone-derived activated carbon (AC) and bimetallic transition metal phosphide (TMP) composites were produced and utilized as electrochemical capacitor (EC) electrodes and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in this study. The base transition metal (TM) was Ni for all samples, and the secondary TM was one of Fe, Mn and Co. AC serves as a porous structure for double layer formation and active sites for OER catalysis. Bimetallic TMP is utilized due to redox reactions in EC and catalytic activity in OER. It is ascertained that secondary TM affects both EC and OER catalysis properties since they introduce multiple redox sites and alter the electronic configuration. As a result, Co is found to be beneficial for EC applications as a secondary TM, while Fe and Mn are shown to improve OER catalysis performance significantly. NiFeP and NiMnP-based composite have 44 mV/dec Tafel slopes and 313 and 316 mV overpotentials, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000852963000001

However, very few electrocatalysts simultaneously exhibit outstanding catalytic activities and large-current durability for both the oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Herein, we report a bifunctional nanoporous Fe-rich nitride hybrid electrocatalyst possessing extraordinary catalytic OER and UOR activities, as evidenced by extremely small potentials of 1.518 and 1.372 V with impressive long-term durability at a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for both OER and UOR in base, respectively. Thus far, this is one of the best electrocatalysts embedding excellent OER and UOR properties in a single electrocatalyst. In particular, combined with an efficient NiMoO4-H-2 catalyst for the HER, we have actualized the commercially viable current density of 500 mA cm(-2) at 1.623 V and 1.472 V for overall water and urea electrolysis with outstanding long-term durability, respectively, outperforming most water or urea electrolysers reported hitherto. This work offers a novel approach to develop multifunctional electrocatalysts from earth-abundant elements for the energy-efficient hydrogen production and pollution treatment of urea-rich wastewater.									34	0	0	0	2	0	34			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000639266000001

Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed atomic transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure determination allows density functional theoretical prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni > Co > Fe, which is confirmed by electrochemical measurements. Determination of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a critical step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities.									991	67	0	0	73	0	994			2520-1158			WOS:000428619500012

In this article we have presented a methodology to significantly improve the OER catalytic efficiency of electrodeposited Ni3Se2 films. Specifically, the pristine Ni3Se2 on surface nanostructuring induced through electrochemical etching shows a remarkable decrease of overpotential (@10 mA cm(-2)) to 190 mV, making it as one of the best OER elecrocatalyst known till date. Through detailed structural and morphological characterization of the catalyst film, we have learnt that such enhancement is possibly caused by the increased surface roughness factor and electrochemically active surface area of the etched film. The morphology of the film also changed from smooth to rough on etching further supporting the enhanced catalytic activity. Detailed characterization also revealed that the composition of the film was unaltered on etching. Ni3Se2 film was also active for HER in alkaline medium making this a bifunctional catalyst capable of full water splitting in alkaline electrolyte with a cell voltage of 1.65 V.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000385675200016

A layered birnessite-like manganese oxide with intercalated metal cations has been prepared and reported to mimic the complex. However, the water oxidation reaction on the Ca2+-containing bimessite is far less active than the oxygen evolution complex (OEC). To determine the reason, the water oxidation mechanism has been studied on Ca-birnessite by the density functional theory. It is found that the O-O bond formation between a mu-oxo and an OH- occurs after the neighboring Mn (III) is oxidized to Mn (IV). Compared to the CaMn4O5 in PSII, the mu-oxo on the surface of Ca-bimessite is less flexible and therefore less active. Additionally, the overpotential for the water oxidation reaction depends on the cation and increases in the order of Ca2+ < Sr2+ < Mg2+. Therefore, flexible mu-oxo and appropriate cations are predicted to be important factors governing the catalytic activity of manganese oxide catalysts.									15	2	0	0	0	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000359683800052

The conversion of light energy into chemical energy is one key step forward in the direction. With that end in view photochemical water oxidation to produce oxygen plays a crucial role. In the present paper we have synthesized a soft oxometalate {PMo12O40@ Mo72Fe30}(n)(1) from its well-known precursor polyoxometalate constituent [Muller et al., Chem. Commun. 1, 657 (2001)]. It is known that in the matter of catalysis, high surface area, possibility of heterogenization, recoverability makes soft oxometalates (SOMs) attractive as catalytic materials. Here we exploit such advantages of SOMs. The SOM based material acts as an active catalyst for photochemical water oxidation reaction with a maximum turnover number of 20256 and turnover frequency of 24.11 min(-1). The catalyst material is stable under photochemical reaction conditions and therefore can be reused for multiple photo catalytic water oxidation reaction cycles.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2251-2373	2251-2381		WOS:000406584000005

Here, we used the single cobalt atom trapped graphyne catalyst (Co@GY) to study the feasibility of modulating its water-splitting catalytic activity through interfacial electron transfer. A series of Co@GY/transition-metal doped graphyne double-layered structures (Co@GY/GY and Co@GY/TM@GY, TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) are systematically evaluated for water splitting via theoretical computations. The electronic structure analyses of different stacking cases revealed that the atomic metals on the adjacent TM@GY layer remarkably tune the electronic structures of the Co atom in the Co@GY layer. A strong linear correlation between Delta G(H*) and the d band center of the Co atom was found, suggesting that the HER activity on the Co atom can be tailored by adjusting the TM on the adjacent TM@GY layer with different d-electron occupations. The volcano-type trend of OER catalytic performance is obtained to show the best Co@GY/Ni@GY catalyst for the OER with an over-potential of 0.38 V, indicating that higher catalytic performance arises from moderate interfacial electron transfer. These results arouse a re-thinking of the intrinsic activity origins of single-atom catalysts (SACs) and offer a new strategy for the structure designing of SACs.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529531500035	32219292

Herein, hierarchically trimetallic Co0.7Fe0.24Ni0.06-BDC (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate, denoted as BDC) coordination polymers have been prepared via ion-exchange by immersing Co-BDC micro-flowers into bimetallic solution under mild conditions. This strategy introduces the other transition metal ions into Co-BDC micro-flower structure without destroying Co-BDC superior flower-like morphology. As electrocatalyst in OER, Co0.7Fe0.24Ni0.06-BDC exhibits an outstanding performance with a small overpotential of 291 mV at 50 mA center dot cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 60.8 mV center dot dec(-1). Durability of Co0.7Fe0.24Ni0.06-BDC is demonstrated by long-term electrochemical stability for 12 h at current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). This enhanced OER activity of Co0.7Fe0.24Ni0.06-BDC micro-flowers attribute to the superior morphology of micro-flowers and the synergistic effect of tri-metal, inducing the presence of abundant active sites and fast charge transfer. This work suggests that Co0.7Fe0.24Ni0.06-BDC micro-flowers have great practical potential in the field of OER.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000624312400010

The obtained structure of nickel phosphates depends on the influence of different kinds of oxygen-containing groups on the graphene substrate. The substrate can also affect the particle size and distribution of nickel phosphate nanoparticles. The substrate can adjust the particle size, distribution, and exposed growth direction of nickel phosphide. These materials with high activity are employed as electrochemical catalysts for methanol oxidation reactions, which is similar to 7 times that of pure nickel phosphide, and there is a very small Tafel slope of 47 mV decade(-1) in the water oxidation reaction. Our results highlight that the substrate structure is essential to catalytic materials for electrochemical oxidation of methanol and water.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000501620700029	31701732

Developing strategies based on earth-abundant metals is important to explore critical aspects of this reaction, and to see whether different and more efficient applications are possible for energy systems. Herein, we present an approach to tuning a redox-active electrocatalyst based on the doping of molybdenum into the tungsten framework of [Co-4( H2O)(2)( PW9O34)(2)](10-), known as the Weakley sandwich. The Mo-doped framework was confirmed by X-ray crystallography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry studies. The doping of molybdenum into the robust Weakley sandwich framework leads to the oxidation of water at a low onset potential, and with no catalyst degradation, whereby the overpotential of the oxygen evolution reaction is lowered by 188 mV compared with the pure tungsten framework.									63	2	0	0	6	0	63			2520-1158			WOS:000428623700013	30079397

By comparison with the benchmarking Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, one of the most spotlighted perovskite oxides, the Ba0.95Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta oxide has lower overpotential and smaller Tafel slope. Furthermore, the Ba0.95Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta catalyst is ultrastable in an alkaline solution. The enhanced HER performance originated from the increased active atoms adjacent to oxygen vacancies on the surface of the Ba0.95Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta catalyst induced by Ba2+-deficiency doping. The low-coordinated active atoms and adjacent oxygen ions may play the role of heterojunctions that synergistically facilitate the Volmer process and thus render stimulated HER catalytic activity. The preliminary results suggest that Ba2+-deficiency doping is a feasible method to tailor the physical and electrochemical properties of perovskite, and that Ba0.95Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-delta is a potential catalyst for HER.									6	1	0	0	0	0	5			0161-0457	1932-8745		WOS:000445604100001	30298097	
J	Luo, Qiaomei; Zhao, Yiwei; Sun, Lan; Wang, Chen; Xin, Hongqiang; Song, Jiaxin; Li, Danyang; Ma, Fei								Interface oxygen vacancy enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution activity of cobalt-iron phosphide/CeO2 hollow nanorods								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				437						135376	10.1016/j.cej.2022.135376				JUN 1 2022	2022	Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a promising way to develop the green hydrogen economy. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) based hybrids are potential catalyst candidates for HER. Herein, hollow hexagonal rods (HHRs) of Co-Fe-P/CeO2 heterojunctions are fabricated using the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as the templates. The hollow frame provides abundant active sites and sufficient mass transfer, the interfacial synergistic effects and the oxygen vacancies at the interface could modulate the electronic structure, improve the water dissociation, and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (delta G(H)*). As a result, the Co-FeP/CeO2 HHRs nanohybrids exhibit excellent HER performances, for which a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) can be obtained at an overpotential of only 69.7 mV in alkaline medium, together with good long-term durability. The results supply the novel platform and useful guidelines for design and construction of non-noble metal based composite electrocatalysts towards HER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000782961400002

In particular, the LiNiO2 catalyst shows high activity. Therefore, to elucidate the fundamental relationship between the local structure, catalyst activity, and stability of LiNiO2, we investigated the cation mixing effect by mixing sites of lithium and nickel ions in the LiNiO2-based catalysts. Lower degrees of cation mixing lead to higher intrinsic OER activity but lower long-term stability. The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) displayed a strong hybridization state of the Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, which is the origin of the different catalytic activity behaviors. Meanwhile, operando XAS studies combined with potentiostatic stability tests and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) demonstrated the Li ion loss during the OER process. Thus, the instability of LiNiO2 originates from de-intercalation of Li ions and this irreversible structure change deteriorates the performance. Hindering the lithium diffusion path by cation mixing is a useful strategy for maintaining performance. This strategy could provide a novel design principle for compatible high activity and long-lasting catalysts by reasonable structure mediation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000589778700001

We report that fluorine-doped carbon black is an active catalyst for OER. Fluorine-doped carbon black (F-KB) is simply synthesized by the pyrolysis of KETJENBLACK (KB) as carbon substrate with Nafion as fluorine precursor. As a result, the OER activity of F-KB is significantly higher than that of pristine KB in alkaline media. The OER catalytic activity of F-KB is found to be dependent on the quantity and characteristics of carbon-fluorine bonding (C-F) which can be controlled by the pyrolysis temperature. It is further found that the OER activity depends on the quantity of semi-ionic C-F bonds, but not covalent C-F bonds. This result proves the importance of carbon atoms with semi-ionic C-F bonds as the active sites for OER.									25	2	0	0	1	0	26			2046-2069			WOS:000430536600003	35540778

Efficient catalysts need to be developed for circumventing the slow kinetics of the discharging oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and charging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode of Li-air batteries. In this study, fullerenes are proposed as active ORR/OER catalysts for Li-air batteries. The reaction mechanisms and final discharge products are investigated for C-20, C-40, C-60, and C-180 fullerenes. Evolutionary patterns of intermediate configurations and energetics of the lithiation processes are scrutinized. A direct size vs activity relationship is established along the O-2 nucleation pathway, which is attributed to the finite-size effects and selective stabilization of (LiO2)(n) clusters over different fullerenes. The lowest discharging overpotential of 0.66 V is identified for C-180 fullerene, which marks a significant improvement in the theoretical ORR overpotential compared to the corresponding reports of standard Li-air battery catalysts such as graphene and comparable activity to that of the Pt(111) surface. The varying surface distribution of pentagons and hexagons on different fullerenes is found to have a significant effect in determining their catalytic activity. In addition to reporting fullerenes as potential catalysts for Li-air batteries for the first time, the study also provides insights into the tunable ORR/OER activity, which can be achieved by regulating the size of fullerenes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000813019300001

In this kind of metal-air battery, electrochemical oxygen evolution and reduction are the two key processes taking place during charging and discharging, respectively. In general, powder form of electrocatalysts are attached to the current collectors by using inactive and insulating polymer binders, which inevitably impede the overall performance, and increase the manufacturing costs of the battery. Therefore, a simple way to construct the 3D current collector combined with efficient electrocatalytic activities remains a big challenge. In this work, a 3D macroporous carbon sponge is prepared by the direct carbonization of commercially available polymer "Magic Eraser". The obtained carbon sponge has interconnected macroporous open 3D scaffold structure and exhibits good flexibility and tailorability. The 3D macroporous carbon sponge shows good bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in seawater. The fabricated hybrid Na-seawater flow battery using 3D macroporous carbon sponge as cathode current collector displays small charge-discharge voltage gap with high voltage efficiency, excellent rechargeability, and long-term cycling stability.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000447555400050

Unlike electrodeposition in aqueous baths, alloy compositions deposited in deep eutectic solvent are found to be the same as in plating solution owing to the enlargement of the deposition window and secondary reaction suppression. By rationally tuning the Ni/Fe ratio in deep eutectic solvent plating solution, the best oxygen evolution reaction performance was achieved by a Ni75Fe25 catalyst, which requires only a 316 mV overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while its Tafel slope is as low as 62 mV dec(-1). This catalyst can operate at 10 mA cm(-2) with negligible activity degradation for over 10 h, promising its potential use as a low-cost, high-performance and stable electrocatalyst in water splitting devices.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000489155800020	31549710

The limited understanding on the complicated battery reactions therein, however, has become a major bottleneck of its development for applications requiring a high energy efficiency and long cycle-life. Herein, in a confined potential window with negligible electrolyte degradation, we studied the rechargeability of Li-O-2 cathodes with pre-filled well-de-fined discharge products of Li2O2, Li2CO3, LiOH, or their combinations. Our results suggest Li2CO3 as the most difficult species to be electrochemically decomposed among the three lithium compounds, whereas the presence of LiOH notably increases the initial charge potential. The clearly visible difference in the charge behavior and cycling stability of these artificially "discharged" electrodes provides a guideline for the development of future high-performance Li-O-2 batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000362824200022	26011604

Herein, we report that Co0.75Ni0.25Se/NF formed by two-step growth of metallic cobalt-nickel selenide nanorods on porous nickel foam was used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. Ni foam serves as a slow-releasing nickel source together with a Co source to form a special proportional cobalt-nickel selenide. Due to its unique rough nanostructure, bimetallic cooperative effects and intrinsic metallic character, the obtained Co0.75Ni0.25Se/NF electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 269 mV (50 mA cm(-2)) for the oxygen evolution reaction and an overpotential of 106 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, this bifunctional electrocatalyst requires a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Besides, based on theoretical calculation, it is further shown that the synergy between Co and Ni elements is beneficial for improving the internal structure of the catalyst, resulting in a high electrical conductivity, and low HER Gibbs free-energy and water adsorption energy. The present results indicate that Co0.75Ni0.25Se/NF exhibits advanced electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. This work offers an appropriate methodology and theoretical guidance to synthesize a bimetal-selenide electrocatalyst for water splitting.									75	3	0	0	3	0	75			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000467776400044	30968074

But the poor kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have blocked the practical application. Designing the efficient bifunctional cathode catalysts is of great importance for the Li-O-2 battery. Tuning the electronic and surface structure of the catalysts plays an important role. Herein, we propose to enhance the catalytic performance of Co3O4 nanosheets for rechargable Li-O-2 batteries by hydrazine hydrate-induced oxygen vacancy formation. The hydrazine hydrate reduction not only introduces oxygen vacancies into Co3O4 nanosheets and modulates the electronic structure but also roughens the surface, which all contribute to the enhancement of ORR and OER activity, especially the activity and stability for OER. Li-O-2 cells catalyzed by the oxygen defects-enriched Co3O4 ultrathin nanosheets exhibit much better electrochemical performances in terms of the high initial capacity (similar to 11 000 mAh g(-1)), the lower overpotential (similar to 1.1 V), and the longer cycle life (150 cycles@200 mA g(-1)). This can be largely attributed to the synergy of the enriched oxygen vacancies and the roughened surface of Co3O4 nanosheets, which not only improves the electron and Li+ conductivity but also provides more active sites and reaction spots. The proposed facile strategy may also be applied to modify other oxides based catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries or other fields.									38	4	0	0	2	0	40			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000465188700031	30788960

The performance of anodes for oxygen evolution reaction during electrolysis of 0.5 kmol m(-3) NaCl solution was examined at 1000 Am-2. The stability, kinetics and physicochemical properties of the oxide deposit anodes were characterized by iR-corrected galvanostatic polarization, gravimetric, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. The addition of tungsten to the Mn-Mo oxide enhanced the oxygen evolution efficiency of anodes. The anode prepared in 0.2 kmol m(-3) Mn2+-0.003 kmol m(-3) Mo6+-0.006 kmol m(-3) W6+ electrolyte of pH 0 showed the best performance among anodes prepared in this work. The high performance was attributed to the formation of single phase triple oxide with optimum composition, thickness and defect concentration. Tungsten addition beneficially exerts its effect via increasing the electrical conductivity of oxide deposits. The deposition mechanism of the oxides was discussed in terms of stability and population of Mn3+ species at the anode/electrolyte interface.

This study reports a feasible method for anchoring the copper oxide nanoparticles on the surface of Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework-67 derived cobalt oxide@nitrogen-doped graphitized carbon (Co3O4@NGC@CuO). For OER, Co3O4@NGC@CuO-0.6 (mass ratio of CuCl2 center dot 2H(2)O to Co3O4@NGC = 0.6) requires only 210 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a faraday efficiency of 93.5%. Owing to the synergies between CuO (Cu2+) shells and Co3O4 (Co2+/Co3+) cores, Cu2+ active sites can moderate the adsorption of oxygen-containing substances and balance the Co2+/Co3+ ratio. Tetrahedral Co2+ (Co-Td(2+)) can be served as the active sites to induce the mu-OOH moieties (Octahedral Co3+, CoOOH) to enhance OER activity and stability. For ORR, Co3O4@NGC@CuO-0.6 has a half-wave potential of 0.865 V, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C (0.868 V). CuO with Cu2+/Cu+ can increase the O-2 adsorption sites, while the active Co-Td(2+) sites can boost the breakage of O-O bonds to produce OH- via a 4e(-) ORR pathway.									19	3	0	0	1	0	20			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000589933600001

Reported herein is the growth of CoP mesoporous nanorod arrays on conductive Ni foam through an electrodeposition strategy. The resulting material of well-defined mesoporosity and a high specific surface area (148 m(2) g(-1)) can be directly employed as a bifunctional and flexible working electrode for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, showing superior activities as compared with noble metal benchmarks and state-of-the-art transition-metal-based catalysts. This is intimately related to the unique nanorod array electrode configuration, leading to excellent electric interconnection and improved mass transport. A further step is taken toward an alkaline electrolyzer that can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage around 1.62 V over a long-term operation, better than the combination of Pt and IrO2. This development is suggested to be readily extended to obtain other electrocatalysis systems for scale-up water-splitting technology.									612	38	0	0	17	0	614			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000366504100010

It is found that the highest activity is obtained by tailoring the crystal size of NiCo2S4 in the hybrid through tuning the construction of metal ammonia complexes. The optimized NiCo2S4/N-CNT nanocomposite exhibits extraordinary bifunctional activity through half reaction testing, displaying comparable ORR activity to state-of-the-art carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) and superior OER capability to RuO2 as well as much better durability. The resulting battery performance in generative Zn-air system further confirms its superb effective bi-functionality for catalyzing dual ORR and OER. Compared with those of well-known commercial Pt/C and RuO2, the synergetic NiCo2S4/N-CNT hybrid enables significantly reduced charge-discharge polarization (similar to 0.63 V), enlarged energy efficiency (similar to 67.2%) and prolonged cyclability up to 150 cycles at 10 mA cm(-2). The tremendously enhanced electrochemical behaviors arise from favorable factors including small sized, homogenous dispersed novel NiCo2S4 nanocrystals and coupling interaction between sulfide spinels and underlying N-doped CNT network, which not only provides efficient electron transfer pathway but also alters the electronic structure, thus facilitating the oxygen electrocatalysis during the discharge-charge processes.									289	22	0	0	8	0	294			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000393446500062

The related technology experiences challenges associated with cost, durability and mass production of hydrogen separated from water. Proper morphological design of highly active and low cost materials for both electrodes and electro-catalyst has become essential to deal with these issues. Here iron alloy cylindrical electrodes with screw pitched morphology and low cost ferrous hydroxide nano-particles have been introduced as an electrode and electro-catalyst respectively in compact integrated water electrolysis cell to catalyze both reactions in same electrolyte. Theoretical model of screw pitched electrode has been made to enhance sharp surface area for efficient Hydrogen and Oxygen evolution. It demonstrates water electrolysis using low cell voltage of 1.68 Vat current density of 500 mA/cm(2) with long term durability over 80 h having utilization efficiency of 73.88% and Faradaic efficiency of 80.714%. The experiments including high speed synthesis of nano-catalysts performed at room temperature provide guarantee of saving energy. This works promises a significant move towards mass production of hydrogen fuel through inexpensive method of water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional noble metal catalysts cannot meet the increasing demand. Therefore, the exploration of cost-effective catalysts with high activity and selectivity is important to promote chemical production. Single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts reduce the use of precious metals compared with traditional catalysts. The unique structure of SAAs, extremely high atom utilization and high catalytic selectivity give them a prominent position in heterogeneous catalysis. SAAs are widely used in selective hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and nitric oxide reduction reaction (NORR). Here, the applications and research progress of copper-based single-atom alloys in the various catalytic reactions mentioned above are mainly introduced, and the factors (such as synthesis method, composition content, etc.) affecting the catalytic performance are analyzed using a combination of various characterization and testing methods.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000629316400001	33616591

However, the self-reconstruction of isolated active sites during OER not only influences the catalytic activity, but also limits the understanding of structure-property relationships. Here, we utilize a self-reconstruction strategy to prepare a SAC with isolated iridium anchored on oxyhydroxides, which exhibits high catalytic OER performance with low overpotential and small Tafel slope, superior to the IrO2. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies in combination with theory calculations indicate that the isolated iridium sites undergo a deprotonation process to form the multiple active sites during OER, promoting the O-O coupling. The isolated iridium sites are revealed to remain dispersed due to the support effect during OER. This work not only affords the rational design strategy of OER SACs at the atomic scale, but also provides the fundamental insights of the operando OER mechanism for highly active OER SACs.									110	5	0	0	8	0	111			2041-1723			WOS:000542982400013	32483164

Therefore, OER catalysts are challenging for many researchers. In this study, an OER catalyst is synthesized using a simple, low-cost method. It has attractive features such as an amorphous phase and nano-sized structure, fabrication using three transition metals, and dual-doping using phosphorus (P) and boron (B). Dual-metal (CNPBO, CMPBO, NMPBO) and single doped (CMNBO) comparison groups are prepared to confirm the efficiency of these features. The use of three transition metals and dual-doping causes metal-metal bonds to weaken, allowing the electrons to move more freely. Accordingly, synthesized Co-Mn-Ni-P-B-O nanoparticles exhibit outstanding intrinsic catalytic performance. The overpotential for j(10) and the Tafel slope decreased 1.59 V and 62 mV/dec compared with the dual metal samples (1.64 V and 96 mV/dec).& nbsp;									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000793260600001

The electrodes were deposited by screen-printing on Ce0.8Gd0.2O1.9 substrates. The pastes were prepared with nanoparticles synthesised by flame spray synthesis and graphite pore former. Without graphite, the electrodes sintered at 1000 degrees C exhibit relatively low porosity and significant densification which led to partial delamination and large overpotentials. The addition of graphite, which was removed by combustion at ca. 650 degrees C during sintering. markedly improves electrode performance by increasing porosity and reducing densification. A minimal overpotential for both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution was reached for a layer porosity of ca. 50-60 vol%. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Han Tian-Ru; Wu Jing-Jing; Qu Zi-Xin; Tang Xin								Pyrochlore Structure Y2-xMgxRu2O7-delta (x=0.05, 0.1, 0.15): Preparation and OER Catalytic Performance								CHINESE JOURNAL OF INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				37	2			285	294		10.11862/CJIC.2021.043				FEB 2021	2021	Herein, pyrochlore structure Y2-xMgxRu2O7-delta (YMRO-x, x=0.05, 0.1, 0.15) catalysts were prepared by solgel method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to analyze the surface chemical composition and valence state of as-synthesized YMRO. The results showed that oxygen defects were increased when Mg2+ partially substituted Y3+ of A site in pyrochlore (A(2)B(2)O(7)(-delta)). Especially, YMRO-0.1 catalyst possessed the most extraordinary performance in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Reaching current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) only required 265 mV overpotential, outperformed the RuO2 (358 mV), Y2Ru2O7-delta (294 mV), YMRO-0.05 (282 mV) and YMRO-0.15 (281 mV). The Tafel slope of YMRO-0.1 was 45 mV.dec(-1), much smaller than that of RuO2 (88 mV.dec(-1)), YRO (64 mV.dec(-1)), YMRO-0.05 (51 mV.dec(-1)) and YMRO-0.15 (52 mV.dec(-1)), having the fastest kinetic process. Turning to siabilit) test of YMRO-0.1, the potential moved little in 12 h, compared with Y2Ru2O7-delta which shifted up 30 mV un der acidic environment. Moreover, first principle calculation indicated that die substitution atom Mg-Y formed a complex with oxygen vacancies, favored the formation of oxygen vacancies, narrowed the band gap, and lowered the charge-transfer-energy. In addition, the excellent OER reactivity can be partly attributed to the Ru5+ ions. Due to the introduction of Mg, the Ru4+ ions at central active site was oxidized to Ru5+ ions, donating electron to surface and accelerating the process of oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the active sites also minimized Gibbs free energy of oxygen radical desorption, which promoted the OER. Based on the results, YMRO should be a promising OER catalytic material which can stably work in acid environment.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1001-4861			WOS:000613965300012

Unlike traditional single-source modification, a novel nitrogen-doped carbon-hosted TMC catalyst with dual transition metals to modulate the electronic structures of tungsten carbide is reported here. It enables implementation by introducing copper from a prefabricated core-shell CuWO4@ZIF-67 precursor and subsequently with an annealing treatment, which not only maximize the active Co and W sites, but also enable the construction of a good interconnected conductive network. Consequently, the optimized nitrogen-doped carbon-supported polymetallic carbide catalyst synthesized at 700 degrees C (denoted as S-2) with a suitable structure and composition configuration exhibits decent activities with ultralow overpotentials (eta) of 238 mV and 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively, along with good overall water splitting performances, surpassing that of majority of TMCs. This work paves viable ways for the rational design and regulation of the local electron structures of metallic carbides by introducing appropriate transition metals.									46	5	0	0	1	0	47			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000018

In this work, a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on transition metal phosphides CoNiP@layered double hydroxides (LDHs) core-shell nanosheets arrays for both OER and HER have been designed and synthesized. The resulting CoNiP@LDHs nanoarrays exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and a remarkable long-term durability (similar to 6 mV degradation after 500 h OER stability test). Especially, this hierarchical nanostructure needs a cell potential as low as 1.44 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is the best performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts among transition metal phosphides to our knowledge.									64	7	0	0	2	0	67			2574-0962			WOS:000458705100050

The performance of the NiCo-loaded CNF sample is compared with a similarly prepared CoOCo/CNF catalyst both for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The combination of nickel and cobalt, both in metallic and oxide form, leads to a bifunctional catalyst with a half wave potential for the ORR of 874 mV vs. RHE and a reversibility (Delta EOER-ORR) of 764 mV. The stability of the catalyst is assessed by means of a 24 h chronopotentiometric test at -80 mA cm(-2) and charge discharge cycles (30 min each) at +/- 20 mA cm(-2). NiCo-loaded CNF shows a remarkable stability, maintaining a constant potential during both tests. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few reports explore how electrocatalytic performance of TMPs changed with the composition of the catalysts. We selected three different component Fe-based Prussian blue analogues (PBA) as precursors and transformed them into corresponding metal phosphides by simple heat treatment. By tuning the phosphidation temperature, a series of FeCoP, FeNiP, and FeMnP were obtained, in which FeCoP under a suitable phosphidation temperature at 400 degrees C exhibits most obviously porous structure and broadest distribution of pore size, which benefits for the mass transfer and oxygen release during OER. Besides, the charge-transfer resistance (R-ct) of TMPs has greatly decreased by introducing of Co in comparison of Ni and Mn, which accelerate the electron transport in OER. Due to the porous geometric structure and unique electronic structure, FeCoP-400 shows excellent and stable electrocatalytic activities of OER in 1 M KOH, with overpotentials of 261 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), superior to commercial RuO2 and most OER electrocatalysts. Furthermore, FeCoP-400 exhibits outstanding stability with only 4% increase in potential during 24 h chronopotentiometry. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The oxygen electrocatalysis involves triple-phase interfaces of solid catalyst, liquid electrolyte and gaseous oxygen. The reaction microenvironment in which the ample transmission pathway sufficiently feeds the highly active sites and expulses product rapidly is typically desired. Herein, the reaction interface microenvironment of hollow spherical bimetallic electrocatalyst (CoFe-SNC) is regulated via structural architecture engineering, achieving the ample triple-phase contact points of O-2 (gas), electrolyte (liquid) and electrocatalyst (solid). Sufficient O-2 supply and unimpeded mass transfer afforded by triple-phase interface flourish catalytic efficiency and enhance oxygen electrocatalysis. Simultaneously the incorporation of sulfur dopant improves the intrinsic catalytic activity, giving rise to highly active sites in reaction interface of CoFeSNC. With such well-constructed triple-phase interface microenvironment, the CoFe-SNC shows outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity (E1/2 = 0.86 V vs RHE) and stability in basic media, and a low charging-discharging voltage gap (1.19 V) with excellent durability is realized in rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787893100003

In order to effectively produce hydrogen at the photocathode of a PEC cell, the photoanode, where the oxygen evolution reaction occurs, should be systematically developed on priority. In particular, WO3 has been identified as one of the most promising photoanode materials owing to its narrow band gap and high valence band position. Its practical implementation, however, is still limited by excessive electron-hole recombination and poor water oxidation kinetics. This review presents the various strategies that have been studied for enhancing the PEC water oxidation performance of WO3, such as controlling the morphology, introducing defects, constructing a heterojunction, loading a cocatalyst, and exploiting the plasmonic effect. In addition, the possible future research directions are presented. (C) 2019, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, a lack of understanding of the key obstacle in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is an obstruction to the design of efficient water-splitting electrocatalysts. Here, we present the single-step and fast fabrication of ready-made Ni(OH)(2)/nickel foam (NF) electrocatalysts for overall water splitting by using the environmentally friendly and sustainable approach of electric-field-assisted pulsed laser ablation in liquid for the generation of nanoparticles (NPs) and the simultaneous electrodeposition of the NPs on the NF substrate. The as-fabricated electrocatalyst is found to be highly efficient and stable in alkaline medium for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER kinetics with remarkably low overpotentials of 187 mV (vs. RHE for HER) and 166 mV (vs. RHE for OER) to reach a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), with HER and OER Tafel slopes of 82 and 69 mV dec(-1), respectively. The two-electrode electrochemical cell made of the bifunctional Ni(OH)(2)/NF electrocatalyst requires an overpotential as low as 168 mV to drive a 10 mA/cm(2) current density over a long period. These results reveal the long-term stability and activity of the Ni(OH)(2))/NF electrocatalyst towards overall water (OW) splitting. The developed sustainable approach of electrocatalyst fabrication can be extended to a range of materials, beyond Ni(OH)(2)/NF, to boost a range of chemical reactions, beyond water splitting.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000607645400026

There are various types of supports reported to anchor single metal atoms. Among them, metal oxides have received much attention because of their specific and variable properties. In this review, the unique role of typical oxide supports in anchoring isolated metal atoms and participating in catalysis is emphasized. The interactions between metal atoms and oxide supports are clarified, so as to show how to stabilize the atomic metal sites and adjust the geometric and electronic structure of single atoms reasonably. Accordingly, we highlight and summarize the progress made in the synthesis of SACs in recent years, placing special emphasis on preventing isolated metal atoms from migrating or agglomerating. In addition, the modern characterization technologies of SACs are summarized and discussed, which can provide strong evidence on the geometrical structures and electronic states of SACs.

These results indicate that catalytic adsorption sites for the O-2 reduction and H-2 oxidation reactions are not blocked at the surface-modified nanoparticles, and that charge and mass transport supporting these electrochemical reactions are feasible in the films.

In this paper, we have developed a kind of composite electrocatalyst Ni:Fe = 7.5:2.5/CF (copper foil) with dendritic FeNi3 phase prepared by electrodeposition for OER (oxygen evolution reaction). The synthetic material with more crystal surface area and more metal active sites exposed exhibits an excellent electrocatalytic activity. The Ni:Fe = 7.5:2.5/CF electrode sample can drive the OER reaction with the overpotential(eta) of 330 mV at 15 mA cm(-2) and 490 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) respectively. And there is no significant overpotential increase for the Ni:Fe = 7.5:2.5/CF sample at the end of 50000s. The composite synergistic effect between the high active FeNi3 phase, dendritic morphology and copper foil substrate are the main reason for its excellent electrocatalytic activity.

Here, we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) bifunctional nanoaerogel electrocatalyst that exhibits good electrocatalytic properties for both OER and ORR. This material was fabricated using a scalable and facile method involving the pyrolysis of (Ni,Co)/CNT alginate hydrogels derived from sustainable seaweed biomass after an ion exchange process. The bifunctionality for oxygen electrocatalysis as shown by the OER-ORR potential difference (DE, the OER and ORR potentials are taken at the current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and (-3) mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, respectively) could be reduced to as low as 0.87 V, comparable to the state-of-the-art non-noble bifunctional catalysts. The good performance was attributed to the ternary Ni/NiO/NiCo2O4 catalytic center for charge transfer and 3D hierarchical mesoporous hybrid framework for efficient mass transport. More importantly, the Zn-air battery fabricated with the hybrid nanoaerogel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst displays very high energy efficiency (58.5%) and long-term stability. Prospectively, our present work may pave a new way to develop earth-abundant and low cost high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts for rechargeable metal-air batteries.									149	9	0	0	8	0	152			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000374862600018

The main products of this reaction are protons and molecular oxygen. In vitro, however, it was demonstrated that reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide are obtained as partially reduced side products. The transition from oxygen to hydrogen peroxide evolution might be induced by light triggered degradation of PS2's active center. Herein, the authors propose an analytical approach to investigate light induced bioelectrocatalytic processes such as PS2 catalyzed water splitting. By combining chronoamperometry and fluorescence microscopy, the authors can simultaneously monitor the photocurrent and the hydrogen peroxide evolution of light activated, solvent exposed PS2 complexes, which have been immobilized on a functionalized gold electrode. The authors show that under limited electron mediation PS2 displays a lower photostability that correlates with an enhanced H2O2 generation as a side product of the light induced water oxidation.

It not only demonstrates a smaller Tafel slope (65 mV dec(-1)) and higher limiting current density (-5.03 mA cm(-2)) but also exhibits an onset potential (-0.10 V vs Ag/AgCl) comparable to that of benchmark Pt/C. Besides undergoing the favorable direct four-electron ORR pathway, it unveils a loss of 23% of its initial current after 6 h of a stability test and a negative shift of 4 mV in the half-wave potential after the accelerated durability test compared to the corresponding current loss of 28% and negative shift of 20 mV for Pt/C. It also reveals remarkable OER activity in an alkaline medium with a low onset potential (0.20 V) and a smaller Tafel slope (177 mV dec(-1)). The bifunctional ORR/OER activity of CuOx-CeO2/C EC can be ascribed to the synergistic effects, its unique structure with enriched oxygen vacancies owing to the presence of Ce4+/Ce3+, robust oxide-oxide and oxide-carbon heterointerfaces, and homogeneous dispersion of oxides over the carbon bed, which facilitates faster electronic conduction.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0743-7463			WOS:000600153800024	33256414

Excellent features of the porous carbon nanofibers with large amounts of Co atoms, N/P-doping effect, abundant pyridinic-N and Co-N-x clusters as catalytic active sites, and the advantages of the structure and composition result in a high catalytic efficiency. In alkaline or acidic media, Co-N-P-CNFs exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activities and kinetics for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), superior methanol tolerance and stability, and a similar four-electron pathway. In addition, Co-N-P-CNFs also shows excellent performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), offering a low onset potential of -0.216 V and a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at potential of -0.248 V. The mechanism of ORR and HER catalytic active site arises from the doping of N/P atoms in the Co-based CNFs, which is responsible for the excellent electrocatalytic performance. Due to the excellent catalytic efficiencies, Co-N-P-CNFs act as a promising catalyst material for fuel cells and water splitting technologies. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The catalytic activity of the pyrochlore based catalysts is increased by the coexistence of Ir and Ru in the B-site of the pyrochlore structure. Lanthanide (Yb, Gd, or Nd) stabilized mixed pyrochlores with a fraction of Ru in the B-site of x(Ru) = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 were synthesized by the spray-freeze freeze-dry approach. All prepared mixed pyrochlore catalysts are surpassing the OER activity of the corresponding iridium and ruthenium analogues featuring no cation mixing as well as that of the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. The synergy of Ir and Ru in the B-site of the pyrochlore structure suppresses the effect of the A-site cation radius on the OER activity. The observed OER activity scales with the Ir-Ru bond distance which represents the local structure of the prepared materials. The most active ytterbium catalyst also shows a significant stability improvement under OER operando conditions over the benchmark IrO2. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we describe the preparation of carbon-supported Pd nanocubes@Mo core@shell nanostructures as efficient dual catalysts for both ORR and HER. The core@shell structure was manifested by high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements, including high angle angular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping analysis. Further structural insights were obtained in X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The nanostructures exhibited apparent electro-catalytic activity toward both ORR and HER, and the performances were markedly higher than those without the deposition of a Mo overlayer. In ORR, the activity was even better than that of commercial Pt/C within the context of onset potential, specific and mass activities; whereas in HER, the performance of Pd nanocubes@Mo core@shell nanostructures remained subpar as compared to that of Pt/C in terms of the overpotential to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the Tafel slope was comparable and the stability was excellent. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to the Pd-Mo synergistic effects imparted from the core-shell structure. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Experiments showed that BTA is mainly inhibiting the anodic reaction of the zinc dissolution reaction. In quiescent solution, the rate-determining step of the corrosion process is mass transport of dissolved oxygen to the electrode surface so that BTA does not significantly decrease the corrosion rate. When the solution is deaerated by nitrogen bubbling, the corrosion rate is controlled by the charge-transfer process and the corrosion rate of zinc is greatly reduced by BTA. When the solution is bubbled with air, the corrosion rate increases significantly. The rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction is charge-transfer controlled and the oxygen reduction is controlled by mass transport.

Typical CO2 electroreduction approaches couple cathodic CO2 reduction with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), resulting in approximately 90% of the electricity input being consumed by the OER. Here, we explore alternatives to the OER and show that the anodic electro-oxidation of glycerol (a byproduct of industrial biodiesel and soap production) can lower electricity consumption by up to 53%. This reduces the process's operating costs and carbon footprint, thus opening avenues for a carbon-neutral cradle-to-gate process even when driven by grid electricity (similar to 13% renewables today), as well as economical production of the 12-electron products ethylene and ethanol. This study may thus serve as a framework for the design of CO2 electroreduction processes with low electricity requirements, enhancing their CO2 utilization potential and economic viability.									229	15	0	0	19	0	236			2058-7546			WOS:000471295000013

Mono-metallic iron-based phosphates have been shown to be active toward HER, but their performance remains unsatisfactory despite their abundant reserves and low preparation cost. Here, guided by the d-band center and band structure theories, V-doped FeP nano-flower grown directly on iron foam are constructed. Combining the density functional theory (DFT) simulations with physical characterizations reveal that the enhanced HER activity is mainly attributed to the lowed d-band central position, increased water dissociation capacity, decreased hydrogen formation energy barrier and reduced charge transfer impedance. As a HER catalyst in 1 M KOH, the obtained V-FeP shows low overpoten-tials of ~149, ~246 and ~290 mV to deliver the current densities of 100, 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) with at least 24 h. When coupled with other highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst (NiFe-LDH/IF), the NiFe-LDH/IF(+) || V-FeP/IF(-) pair also performs a low cell voltage and over 100-h stability at high current density of 1000 mA cm(-2), which endows it a large potential in the practical electrolytic water industry. Our work may provide a reference for the enhancement of inert and low-cost HER-active iron phosphide.

J	Exner, Kai S.								Comparison of the Conventional Volcano Analysis with a Unifying Approach: Material Screening Based on a Combination of Experiment and Theory								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				124	1			822	828		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b10860				JAN 9 2020	2020	Material screening in electrocatalysis has been spurred by the concept of volcano plots, which rely on analyzing binding energies at zero overpotential. Recently, a unifying material-screening approach was introduced by the author: the combination of first-principles calculations with a single experimental input parameter, that is, the threshold overpotential, at which the experimental Tafel slope exceeds 59 mV/dec in the respective class of materials, results in an ESSI-descriptor activity map. Therein, besides the analysis of binding energies, also the applied overpotential, decisive reaction intermediate, rate-determining reaction step, and electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI) are accounted for. On the example of the oxygen evolution reaction over RuO2(110) surfaces, the two different frameworks are compared: while the conventional volcano method relies on a rough screening of the parameter space, as possibly promising surface configurations could be overlooked, the concept of ESSI-descriptor activity maps accounts for a more thorough sorting of electrode materials.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000507149600087

The electrocatalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction was investigated by dc linear polarization and electrochemical impedance measurements. XRD characterization showed that pure perovskite crystals were formed. FESEM images showed that changing the type of the B-site metal ion affected the morphology of the prepared perovskites. HRTEM images confirmed the formation of the orthorhombic phase LaCrO3 and the rhombohedral phases of LaNiO3, LaMnO3 and LaCoO3. The order of the electrocatalytic activity was LaNiO3 > LaFeO3 > LaMnO3, that was related to the calculated values of the activation energy 11.38, 20.13 and 22.01 kJ mol(-1) for LaBO3 (B = Ni, Fe and Mn), respectively. LaCrO3 and LaCoO3 showed no catalytic activity toward OER due to the dissolution and the formation of passive layer of CO3O4 when being tested in HClO4 medium. The reaction order and mechanism were identified.

Here, hierarchical core-shell N-doped carbon encapsulated array-like FeP4 and CoP active components have been fabricated in situ on the surface of nickel foam (NC@FeP4-CoP/NF) by etching sheet-like ZIF-67 arrays, Prussian analog formation, and phosphating in turns. The crystallinity, hierarchical heterostructure, and chemical state have been carefully discussed. Electrochemical studies demonstrate that the catalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic activity and durability in electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (eta(20) = 218 mV) and hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(10) = 116 mV), better than most previously reported bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the bifunctional catalyst only needs 1.72 and 1.80 V cell voltages at 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2) respectively, together with a good catalytic stability at 500 mA cm(-2) for 48 h, implying potential commercialization prospects. This excellent electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the distinctive hierarchical structure as well as core-shell NC encapsulated FeP4-CoP active sites, which can enhance the charge transport rate, inhibit the exfoliation of the active materials, provide a larger active surface area, and facilitate electrolyte diffusion and gas release.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000652549200001

Phase transformation and microstructural evolution of the quenched samples were observed by XRD, SEM, and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The results showed that the combustion proceeded by a dissolution-precipitation mechanism, viz the iron was burned to form Fe2O3 in an oxygen atmosphere and melting of the Fe2O3 led to the dissolving of the ZnO particles, then ZnFe2O4 precipitated out. In addition, a model of the mechanism was drawn. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0025-5408			WOS:000185126400013

According to newer geochemical data, oxygen rose to approximately its present atmospheric levels very late in evolution, perhaps as late as the origin of land plants (only about 450 million years ago). It is therefore natural that many lineages of eukaryotes harbor, and use, enzymes for oxygen-independent energy metabolism. This paper provides a concise overview of anaerobic energy metabolism in eukaryotes with a focus on anaerobic energy metabolism in mitochondria. We also address the widespread assumption that oxygen improves the overall energetic state of a cell. While it is true that ATP yield from glucose or amino acids is increased in the presence of oxygen, it is also true that the synthesis of biomass costs thirteen times more energy per cell in the presence of oxygen than in anoxic conditions. This is because in the reaction of cellular biomass with O-2, the equilibrium lies very far on the side of CO2. The absence of oxygen offers energetic benefits of the same magnitude as the presence of oxygen. Anaerobic and low oxygen environments are ancient. During evolution, some eukaryotes have specialized to life in permanently oxic environments (life on land), other eukaryotes have remained specialized to low oxygen habitats. We suggest that the Km of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase of 0.1-10 mu M for O-2, which corresponds to about 0.04%-4% (avg. 0.4%) of present atmospheric O-2 levels, reflects environmental O-2 concentrations that existed at the time that the eukaryotes arose.									22	0	0	0	20	0	23			0891-5849	1873-4596		WOS:000485873700025	30935869	
J	Liu, Ping; Han, Huijuan; Xia, Qingyun; Ma, Nini; Lu, Sihan; Shang, Xuefang; Wang, Ge; Chao, Shujun								Facile construction of S-containing Co-based metal organic framework core-shell microspheres as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				50	33			11440	11445		10.1039/d1dt01765a		JUL 2021		SEP 7 2021	2021	A cost-effective non-noble metal bifunctional electrocatalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is very important for energy-related applications. Micro/nanomaterials with core-shell structures have emerged as potential non-noble metal catalyst candidates. Herein, an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, S-containing Co-based metal organic framework core-shell microspheres (Co-MOF-CSMSs), has been designed and constructed by using 2,2 ':5 ',2 ''-terthiophene-5,5 ''-dicarboxylic acid as a novel ligand through a facile one-step hydrothermal method. Due to the integrated favorable structural characteristics of the core-shell structure and MOFs for electrocatalysis, Co-MOF-CSMSs are revealed as a good bifunctional electrocatalyst for the ORR and OER, including an onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), a half-wave potential of 0.78 V vs. RHE and an overpotential of 0.35 V at 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a low-cost and facile method to design and construct advanced micro/nanomaterials with core-shell structures to targetedly develop high-performance bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000682108000001	34359071

Herein, we report the prominent enhancement of OER activity via doping vanadium into CoFe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalysts. Electrochemical characterization shows that the Co2Fe0.5V0.5 LDH grown on carbon papers (CPs) has an enormous electrochemical surface area (ECSA) and exhibits the smallest overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which only requires a small Tafel slope of 41.4 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH solution. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak position of Co, Fe and O moves slightly to higher binding energy, elucidating the improved covalency of the metal-oxygen bond after V doping. DFT+U simulation indicates that the outstanding electrocatalytic activity of Co2Fe0.5V0.5 could be ascribed to the increased metal-oxygen covalency in LDH after V element doping, and facilitates the charge-transfer from oxygen to the metal. This finely tuned strategy by V doping into the CoFe-based LDH matrix can adjust the covalency of metal-oxygen bridges and enhance its electrocatalytic activity for the OER. In this work, we also present a general method to study various highly efficient metal hydroxide catalysts for the OER.									28	4	0	0	3	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506883100022	31782483

Hematite nanoparticles with pseudo cubic, hexagonal bipyramid and plate morphologies were prepared, which predominantly have exposed (012), (113) and (001) facets, respectively. The OER activity of hematite measured under alkaline conditions was significantly dependent on the surface orientation, and the onset potential of the (001) facet was more than 130 mV more negative than those of the (012) and (113) facets. On the basis of the results of spectroelectrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations, this higher activity of the (001) facet was attributed to the lower energy required for the formation of oxo intermediate species. When pH conditions changed from alkaline to neutral, the facet dependence was less pronounced and the OER initiated from almost the same potential on all of the three facets. These findings indicate that the factor determining the OER activity of hematite differs depending on pH, and the surface structure strongly affects the OER activity under conditions where the concerted transfer of protons and electrons proceeds.									8	2	0	0	0	0	9			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000540915300023

This work demonstrates a zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) nanoplate self-template approach to fabricate 2D porous oxygen-incorporated cobalt phosphide (CoPO) ultrathin nanosheets. The synthesis starts with the oriented growth of ZIF-67 nanoplates along [211] crystal plane, followed by oxidation/phosphorization processes for pore generation and O/P coincorporation in the hybrid. The resultant 2D porous CoPO nanosheets afford very small voltages of 1.52 and 1.98 V for overall water splitting at 10 and 200 mA cm(-2), respectively. This excellent bifunctionality further provides the basis for photovoltage-driven water splitting at a Faradaic efficiency of 97.6%. These findings offer a general strategy for rational design and modulation of 2D porous catalysts for various electrocatalytic and other applications.									142	5	0	0	5	0	142			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000426154500022

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are appealing to design efficient OER electrocatalysts, however, their intrinsic poor conductivity strongly hinders the activity. Here, we show a strategy to boost the OER activity of poor-conductive MOFs by confining them between graphene multilayers. The resultant NiFe-MOF//G gives a record-low overpotential of 106 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and retains the activity over 150 h, which is in significant contrast to 399 mV of the pristine NiFe-MOF. We use X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and computations to demonstrate that the nanoconfinement from graphene multilayers not only forms highly reactive NiO6-FeO5 distorted octahedral species in MOF structure but also lowers limiting potential for water oxidation reaction. We also demonstrate that the strategy is applicable to other MOFs of different structures to largely enhance their electrocatalytic activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000870349500013	36257963

However, limited by sluggish kinetics, it is necessary to find corresponding efficient electrocatalysts for OER to accelerate its reaction speed. Herein, we report a self-supporting electrode using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate to synthesize Cu-doped nickel sulfide nanosheets array on its surface (named Cu-Ni3S2/NF), which are effective electrocatalysts for OER with low overpotential (270 mV @J= 50 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slope (57 mV dec(-1)). Due to Cu dopant, it could induce the rearrangement of Ni3S2 lattice atoms, resulting in multiple defects and unsaturated metal coordination sites. In addition, it can effectively trigger the surface oxidation of Ni3S2 nanosheets and greatly increase the carrier density near the Fermi level, which remarkably enhances the conductivity. This unique in situ strategy could potentially pave the way for a new generation of electrocatalysts for OER and related energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000836366100003

The FDCA-based polyethylene 2,5-furan dicarboxylate (PEF) polymer is a green candidate for substituting polyethylene terephthalate. This work demonstrated a highly efficient CoB/g-C3N4 nanosheet on the surface of the nickel foam as an electrode for the HMF electrooxidation reaction. Electrolysis at a constant potential combined with liquid chromatography showed the formation of FDCA with a yield of 97% with an excellent faradaic efficiency of near 95%. CoB/g-C3N4 achieved a current density of 20 mA cm(-2) for HMF oxidation in 1.0 M KOH with 10 mM HMF at 1.37 V vs. RHE before the competing oxygen evolution reaction. The electrocatalyst was effectively reused up to three times without compromising efficiency. This work demonstrates a cheap and active electrocatalyst material for the electrochemical formation of FDCA from HMF and gives perception into the reaction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000809996900001

The metal-free sulfur/nitrogen in-situ co-doped carbon nanosheets are prepared through polymerization process and carbonization process using aniline as a nitrogen source, 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide as a sulfur source and NaCl as a template and protective layer. The obtained catalysts show the obvious two dimensional nanosheet structure with successful doping of S and N. Benefiting from high contents of S atoms and N atom, high special surface area and graphitic degree, well-ordered micropores and synergetic interaction between thiophenic-S, pyridinic N and graphitic N, the optimal catalyst S3/N-CNS800 shows excellent oxygen reduction performance with 13.2mV more positive half-wave potential than that of 20% Pt/C, superior long-term durability and tolerance to methanol cross-over.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2365-6549			WOS:000434412700003

The practical use of molecular water-splitting catalysts relies on their integration onto electrode materials. We describe herein the immobilization of cobalt corroles on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by four strategies and compare the performance of the resulting hybrids for H-2 and O-2 evolution. Co corroles can be covalently attached to CNTs with short conjugated linkers (the hybrid is denoted as H1) or with long alkane chains (H2), or can be grafted to CNTs via strong pi-pi interactions (H3) or via simple adsorption (H4). An activity trend H1 >> H3> H2 approximate to H4 is obtained for H-2 and O-2 evolution, showing the critical role of electron transfer ability on electrocatalysis. Notably, H1 is the first Janus catalyst for both H-2 and O-2 evolution reactions in pH 0-14 aqueous solutions. Therefore, this work is significant to show potential uses of electrode materials with well-designed molecular catalysts in electrocatalysis.									114	11	0	0	4	0	114			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000452396800013	30242949

The obtained Mn-Fe oxides retained the nanocubic morphology of the PBA precursor, and a mesoporous structure was acquired as a result of gas molecule release during the pyrolysis process. Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of the asprepared catalysts was tested, and among the bimetallic oxides, the catalyst that had a crystal structure similar to cubic bixbyite Ma(1.2)Fe(0.8)O(3) (space group: la-3) with low crystallinity exhibited the most advanced OER activity. An overpotential of only 245 mV was required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slope value was only 38 mV dec(-1). The excellent OER activity is likely due to the hollow porous morphology of the samples, the synergistic effect of Mn and Fe, the defect-rich low crystallinity of the catalyst, and the cubic Mn1.2Fe0.8O3 structure (space group: la-3), which has an intrinsic activity superior to that of spinet Ma(1)(.)(8)Fe(1)(.)(2)O(4).

These applications require catalysts to perform the required oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It would be ideal to use a non-noble metal-based multifunctional catalyst for these reactions. Herein, a new type of porous carbon doped with Cu, N, S was prepared as a trifunctional catalyst for the ORR, OER, and HER from S-rich polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). By oxidatively treating the PPS, we critically prevented high-temperature melting of the precursor. Further, high-temperature pyrolysis using ammonia (NH3) desulfurized and introduced N into the carbon matrix, increasing structural defects and the surface area. By introducing copper during the pyrolysis, the tridoped (Cu, N, S) catalyst was successfully synthesized. The extremely large number of active sites and the local chemical environment enable excellent electrocatalytic performance and stability across ORR, OER, and HER at levels superior or comparable to noble metals. This catalyst was also used as the sole catalyst in Zn-air batteries and overall water splitting to demonstrate excellent performance. This synthesis method can pave the way toward new catalyst design and discovery, enabling more versatile and robust energy applications.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2168-0485			WOS:000705367800020

A photoelectrochemical (PEC) device would therefore play a key role in offering the possibility of carbon-neutral solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis. The past five years have seen a surge in the development of promising semiconductor materials. In addition, low-cost earth-abundant co-catalysts are ubiquitous in their employment in water splitting cells due to the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This review commences with a fundamental understanding of semiconductor properties and charge transfer processes in a PEC device. We then describe various configurations of PEC devices, including single light-absorber cells and multi light-absorber devices (PEC, PV-PEC and PV/electrolyser tandem cell). Recent progress on both photoelectrode materials (light absorbers) and electrocatalysts is summarized, and important factors which dominate photoelectrode performance, including light absorption, charge separation and transport, surface chemical reaction rate and the stability of the photoanode, are discussed. Controlling semiconductor properties is the primary concern in developing materials for solar water splitting. Accordingly, strategies to address the challenges for materials development in this area, such as the adoption of smart architectures, innovative device configuration design, co-catalyst loading, and surface protection layer deposition, are outlined throughout the text, to deliver a highly efficient and stable PEC device for water splitting.									780	37	0	0	34	0	791			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000406613800012	28644493

However, developing high-performance and durable oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts is an ongoing challenge. In this work we prepared Ni-phytate thin films with a bubble-like structure on Ni-foam through an in situ growth process. The resulting material can be used as an oxygen-evolving electrode in basic media without requiring the use of a conductive binder. The Ni-phytate electrode has high catalytic activity eta(j = 10 mA cm-2)= 280 mV) and good stability (the current activity remained 95% after 5 h) towards OER.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered as the bottleneck reaction in an overall water splitting system because it involves 4e(-) and 4H(+) transfer processes. Currently, it is highly desirable to explore low-cost alternative catalysts for OER at ambient conditions. Herein, we report for the first time that nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanosheets can be facilely grown on Fe foam (FF) as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER with excellent durability and catalytic activity under alkaline conditions. To reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), the Ni2P-FF catalyst required a low overpotential of only 198 mV for OER. The catalyst's high OER activity and durability were well maintained at a high current density. The required overpotentials were only 267 and 313 mV to achieve the current densities of 100 and 300 mA/cm(2), respectively. The combination of low-cost Fe foam with Ni(2)xP provides a promising low-cost catalyst for large-scale application of electrocatalytic water splitting.

Herein, through electron engineering and structure manipulation simultaneously, we constructed Fe-embedded pyridinic-N-dominated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on ordered mesoporous carbon, showing excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity (half-wave potential, 0.85 V) and an overpotential of 420 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media (potential difference, 0.80 V). Density functional theory calculation indicates those Fe@N-4 clusters improve charge transfer and further promote the electrocatalytic reactivity of the functionalized region in CNTs. Rechargeable Zn-air batteries were assembled, displaying robust charging-discharging cycling performance (over 90 h) with voltage gap of only 0.08 V, much lower than that of the Pt/C + Ir/C electrode (0.29 V). This work presents a highly active nonprecious metal-based bifunctional catalyst toward air electrode for energy conversion.									65	13	0	0	4	0	66			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000448754500022	30260211

Here, we report sta-ble NiPbOx films that are able to perform oxygen evolution reac-tion (OER) catalysis for extended periods of operation (>20 h) in acidic solutions of pH 2.5; conversely, native NiOx catalyst films dissolve immediately. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that PbO2 is un-perturbed after addition of Ni and/or Fe into the lattice, which serves as an acid-stable, conductive framework for embedded OER active centers. The ability to perform OER in acid allows the mechanism of Fe doping on Ni catalysts to be further probed. Catalyst activity with Fe doping of oxidic Ni OEC under acid con-ditions, as compared to neutral or basic conditions, supports the contention that role of Fe3+ in enhancing catalytic activity in Ni oxide catalysts arises from its Lewis acid properties.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000553292000023	32636264

Herein, via direct laser printing on an Mn-based metal-organic framework (Mn-MOF) in air, MnO/Mn3O4 nanoparticles confined in mesoporous graphitic carbon can be mass-produced rapidly. It is revealed that the structural transformations in manganese oxides (MnOx -> Mn3O4 -> MnO) occur during the decomposition of the Mn-MOF and the MnO/Mn3O4 nanoparticles promote the catalytic graphitization of disordered carbon. The composite shows high electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performances in the alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 394 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and good durability of 75% retention after 24 h. In addition, it also exhibits promising supercapacitive performances with a specific capacitance of 194 F g(-1) and reasonable stability of 82% retention after 5000 cycles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2196-7350			WOS:000711499700001

In this work, we have successfully prepared CoMoO4 nanorods (NR) with {100} facets exposed mainly and CoMoO4 nanosheets (NS) with {010} exposed mainly via a facile hydrothermal route. It is found that although the CoMoO4 NS has a 7 times higher surface area (49.3 m(2)g(-1)) than the CoMoO4 NR (7.0 m(2)g(-1)), the CoMoO4 NR has a 5.7 times higher OER current density (8.93 mA cm(cat)(-2)) than the CoMoO4 NS (1.56 mA Cm-cat(-2)) at 550 mV. Its higher intrinsic OER activity is mainly attributed to the exposed {100} facets of CoMoO4 NR. Compared with {010} facets (0.41 Jm(-2)), the {100} facets with a higher surface energy (0.54 Jm(-2)) are more reactive, and the more Co atoms on (100) surface can provide more OER active sites. This work demonstrates that the control of active facets exposed is a promising way for the development of efficient OER catalysts. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein we report a scalable one-pot strategy for in situ regulation of La vacancies (V-La) in LaMnO3.15 by simply introducing urea in the traditional citrate process, and further reveal the fundamental relationship between V-La creation and surface lattice oxygen (O-latt) activation. The underlying mechanism is shortened Mn-O bonds, decreased orbital ordering, promoted MnO6 bending vibration and weakened Jahn-Teller distortion, ultimately realizing enhanced Mn-3d and O-2p orbital hybridization. The LaMnO3.15 with optimized V-La exhibits order of magnitude increase in toluene oxidation and ca. 0.05 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) increase of half-wave potential in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The reported strategy can benefit the development of novel defect-meditated perovskites in both heterocatalysis and electrocatalysis.									17	0	0	0	2	0	17			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000718891000001	34665490

Transition metal-based compound combined with carbon materials have been found to be effective catalysts toward the HER and ORR with great potential to replace conventional precious metal-based catalysts. Herein, a low-cost method is described for the fabrication and testing of sulfide (CoS)/carbon compound with high specific surface area and mesoporous structure by using peptone as raw material and NaCl as template. The obtained materials showed open structures composed of interconnected thin carbon nanosheets with transition metal-based nanoparticles wrapped inside the carbon matrix. These as-prepared materials were used as HER and ORR bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis and Zn-air battery. In the alkaline media, the optimized catalysts exhibited highly efficient electrocatalysis toward the HER. They also showed an outstanding ORR activity and durability which was found to be superior to commercial Pt/C catalysts. In an assembled primary Zn-air cell containing the optimized sample, the open circuit voltage (OCV) was 1.44 V, higher than the value for Zn-air cell containing Pt/C. The assembled Zn-air cell delivered a power density of 119 mW cm(-2) at 150 mA cm(-2), higher than the Pt/C cell (97 mW cm(-2) at 150 mA cm(-2)).									31	2	0	0	0	0	31			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000459736500013

Here, vacancy-induced nanostructured LaMnO3 perovskite was generated by a facile hydrothermal method and explored as a bifunctional air-breathing electrode for rechargeable Lithium-Air battery. Materials characterizations confirmed the formation of the nanostructured LaMnO3 with anion and cation vacancies. The LaMnO3 electrocatalyst on rotating ring disc electrode study showed excellent oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The oxygen vacancies associated with the LaMnO3 acted as catalyst centre and promoted reaction rate for the ORR and OER. Laboratory prototype CR-2032 air-coin cell was fabricated using the LaMnO3 as air-breathing electrode, resulted open circuit voltage 3.3 V for more than 5 days and high discharge capacity of 3100 mA h g(-1) at current density of 50 mA g(-1).

In this work, with rationally designing V/Co metal-organic framework (V/Co-MOF) as a precursor, a series of V8C7 decorating CoP nanosheets-assembled microspheres (V8C7/CoP) was synthesized via pyrolysis and a subsequent phosphidation. Thanks to the synergistic effect between V8C7 and CoP, the optimized V8C7/CoP as trifunctional catalysts exhibit remarkable performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). More importantly, we propose an acid-alkaline asymmetric-electrolyte electrolyzer (AAAE) by using the optimized V8C7/CoP electrode as both acidic cathode for HER and alkaline anode UOR, respectively. The optimum AAAE system only needs an applied voltage of 0.8 V to reach an electrolytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen production, which significantly reduces the energy consumption for hydrogen production owing to the assistance of electrochemical neutralization energy (ENE) and electrochemical urea oxidation energy.									34	0	0	0	9	0	34			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000561598900004

However, the sluggish ORR and OER requires a significantly large quantity of precious metals (e.g., Pt or Ir) to enhance reaction activity and durability. Highly active and robust nonprecious metal catalysts (NPMCs) are desperately required to address the cost and durability issues. Among NPMC formulations studied, carbon-based catalysts hold the greatest promise to replace these precious metals in the future due to their low-cost, extremely high surface area, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, sufficient stability under harsh environments, and high functionality. In particular, nitrogen-doped carbon nanocomposites, which were prepared from "metal-free" N-C formulations and transition metals-derived M-N-C (M=Fe or Co), have demonstrated remarkably improved catalytic activity and stability in alkaline and acidic electrolytes. In this review, based on the recent progress in the field, we aim to provide an overview for both types of carbon catalysts in terms of catalyst synthesis, structure/morphology, and catalytic activity and durability enhancement. We primarily focus on elucidation of synthesis-structure-activity correlations obtained from synthesis and extensive characterization, thereby providing guidance for rational design of advanced catalysts for the ORR. Additionally, a hybrid concept of using highly ORR active carbon nanocomposites to support Pt nanoparticles was highlighted with an aim to enhance catalytic performance and reduce required precious metal loading. Beyond the ORR, opportunities and challenges of ORR/OER bifunctional carbon composite catalysts were outlined. Perspectives on these carbon-based catalysts, future approaches, and possible pathways to address current remaining challenges are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we present a simple but efficient method that utilizes ZIF-67 as the precursor and template for the one-step generation of homogeneous dispersed cobalt sulfide/N,S-codoped porous carbon nanocomposites as high-performance electrocatalysts. Due to the favourable molecular-like structural features and uniform dispersed active sites in the precursor, the resulting nanocomposites, possessing a unique core-shell structure, high porosity, homogeneous dispersion of active components together with N and S-doping effects, not only show excellent electrocatalytic activity towards ORR with the high onset potential (around -0.04 V vs. -0.02 V for the benchmark Pt/C catalyst) and four-electron pathway and OER with a small overpotential of 0.47 V for 10 mA cm(-2) current density, but also exhibit superior stability (92%) to the commercial Pt/C catalyst (74%) in ORR and promising OER stability (80%) with good methanol tolerance. Our findings suggest that the transition metal sulfideporous carbon nanocomposites derived from the one-step simultaneous sulfurization and carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks are excellent alternative bifunctional electrocatalysts towards ORR and OER in the next generation of energy storage and conversion technologies.									241	16	0	0	9	0	246			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000365982700039	26599403

However, its implementation remains as a major challenge since the anodic reaction is sluggish. Here, we designed an artificial sandwich-like S,P-(Ni,Mo,Fe)OOH/NiMoP/wood aerogel electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The sample required low overpotentials of 297 mV for OER and 258 mV for HER to achieve 500 mA cm-2 in alkaline seawater. The features of the 3D wood aerogel, including open and well-aligned microchannels, large specific surface area, and good wetting ability, endow the as-synthesized electrocatalysts with impresive OER and HER activities. The two-electrode electrolyzer provides 500 mA cm-2 at 1.861 V for overall seawater electrolysis. This work opens new avenues for developing effective and robust OER/HER catalysts for seawater electrolysis, which significantly advances clean energy systems research.									41	2	0	0	6	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000663202100005

The catalytic activities of LNO catalysts for OER were pseudo-spinel (PS-LiNiO2) > disordered (DO-LiNiO2) > layered (L-LiNiO2) lithium nickel oxide. Particularly, PS-LiNiO2 demonstrated much lower tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) with the highest durability whereas the layered LNO catalysts exhibited the higher tafel slope of 88 mV dec (-1), respectively. To elucidate the origin of high activities of LNO catalysts, three structures of LNO were studied by EXAFS measurements and DFT theoretical calculation. Compared to L-LiNiO2, PS-LiNiO2, including Ni4O4 cubane structural motifs, exhibited higher valent states and lower Ni d-band center to drive the catalytic reaction. Thus, our results demonstrated that the activities of LNO can be optimized by controlling the value states, chemical and local electronic structure of Ni via novel design approaches.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000436933700006

This implies, among others, developing efficient catalytic materials from abundant and low-cost resources and investigating their performance, especially in the oxidation of water as this half-reaction is the bottleneck of the water splitting process. For this purpose, NiFe-based nanoparticles with sizes ca. 3-4 nm have been synthesized by an organometallic approach and characterized by complementary techniques (WAXS, TEM, STEM-HAADF, EDX, XPS, and ATR-FTIR). They display a Ni core and a mixed Ni-Fe oxide shell. Once deposited onto FTO electrodes, they have been assessed in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction under alkaline conditions. Three different Ni/Fe ratios (2/1, 1/1 and 1/9) have been studied in comparison with their monometallic counterparts.

However, the detrimental corrosion may be applied to produce serviceable materials, resulting in "upcycling waste into wealth". Herein, a novel corrosion engineering is employed to fabricate hierarchical iron rusts/Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet-on-microsphere arrays as effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Through physically mixing the fabricated ultrathin iron rusts with Ni(OH)(2) microspheres, the as-prepared catalyst requires an overpotential of only 318 mV to achieve the current density of 20 mA cm(-2). Besides, negligible increasement of overpotential is observed after continuous chronopotentiometric determination for 30 h. The excellent OER property is attributed to the formed oxygen bridges of Fe-O-Ni on the solid-solid contact sites, which promote oxidation of Ni2+ specieses via the interfacial Fe3+ of iron rusts (FeOOH). In particular, a large-scale production of 2.968 g iron rusts/Ni(OH)(2) catalysts was successfully prepared by using this simple, lowcost yet valid corrosion engineering. This work provides a novel avenue towards large-scale production of efficient OER catalysts by combing with corrosion science, which is beneficial for boosting the progress of water splitting.

J	Goyal, Arun								Osmoregulation in Dunaliella, Part I: Effects of osmotic stress on photosynthesis, dark respiration and glycerol metabolism in Dunaliella tertiolecta and its salt-sensitive mutant (HL 25/8)								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				45	9			696	704		10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.05.008				SEP 2007	2007	The photosynthetic oxygen evolution increased by about 30% over control when Dunaliella tertiolecta and its salt-sensitive mutant (HL 25/8) were stressed by raising NaCl concentration from 0.17 to 0.4 M, however, during the dilution stress the photosynthetic oxygen evolution was progressively decreased with increasing dilution (decreasing the salinity). The photosynthetic oxygen evolution is affected by the water potential of the medium rather than by the ionic strength. Mitochondrial dark respiration was unaffected by salt stress, however, it was increased by about 50% (parent strain) and 35% (the mutant) upon dilution as if reduced pyridine nucleotide generated during glycerol dissimilation reaction were continuously oxidized by the mitochondria. The salt stress-induced changes in photosynthetic (CO2)-C-14 fixation were consistent with the observed rates of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. The mutant strain showed about one-half the capability for photosynthesis, and glycerol synthesis compared to the parent strain. However, the proportion of photosynthetically newly fixed carbon during salt stress in glycerol was similar in both strains. The glycerol dissimilation capabilities of both strains were also similar. It is suggested that the salt sensitivity of the mutant is probably due to its reduced dissolved inorganic carbon transport, photosynthetic and starch metabolism capabilities to provide carbon for glycerol synthesis in the time frame of adaptation process.

Results concerning the oxidation kinetics as well as the identification and quantification of hydroxylated products are reported. First order kinetics are used to describe the consumption rates of both compounds despite of the anode material and of the applied current density. A simple kinetic model that accounts for the anode surface coverage by HO radicals is proposed. Based on this model it is possible to correlate the apparent rate constant of the organic consumption with kinetic parameter related to the organics reactivity and to the degree of the adsorption of HO radicals to the anode surface.

Thus, it is of great significance but still remains challenging to develop stable, efficient, and economical catalysts that could provide a high current density at a low overpotential. In this work, we report an economical synthesis of metal organic framework (MOF) derived Ni-doped CoS2, grown on carbon fiber paper (Ni-doped CoS2/CFP), as a new OER catalyst with high catalytic activity and durability. The binder-free Ni-doped CoS2/CFP electrode exhibits a very low overpotential of 270 mV (versus RHE) at 10 mAcm(-2), a Tafel slope of 79 mVdec(-1), and high durability during 3000 cyclic voltammetry sweeps. Such a remarkable OER performance exceeds that of most of noble-metal-free materials and even commercial IrO2. The significantly improved OER performance is largely ascribed to the synergic effects of Ni doping and the conductive CFP catalyst support, leading to an enhanced electron and mass transfer during the OER process. We believe that the as-prepared Ni-doped CoS2/CFP material holds great promise as an economical OER electrocatalyst for energy-related applications.									34	3	0	0	0	0	34			2196-0216			WOS:000461580800032

In this work, we identify CoTiOx as a novel nonprecious metal catalyst for the OER and explore the effect of temperature treatments on its activity, structure, and electronic state. Using a simple and scalable sol-gel synthesis, this catalyst can be deposited on a wide variety of conductive substrates. Physical and electronic characterization of the most active CoTiOx catalyst, prepared at low temperature (150 degrees C), reveals an amorphous thin film structure with an oxidation state similar to that of other active cobalt catalysts. Electrochemical testing and X-ray absorption spectroscopy show that the more active, amorphous catalysts undergo greater changes in oxidation state during OER than the less active, crystalline catalysts. Extended electrochemical testing shows that the catalysts are stable in basic electrolyte. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

However, the direct pyrolysis of bulk MOFs usually gives microporous carbonaceous materials, which significantly hinder the mass transportation and the accessibility of active sites. Herein, N-doped carbon aerogels with hierarchical micro-, meso-, and macropores were fabricated through one-step pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8/carboxymethylcellulose composite gel. Owing to the hierarchical porosity, high specific surface area, favorable conductivity, excellent thermal and chemical stability, the as-prepared N-doped carbon aerogel exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, long-term durability, and good methanol tolerance in alkaline medium. This work thus provides a new way to fabricate new types of MOF-derived carbon aerogels for various applications.									13	0	0	0	2	0	13			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000478485100001	31267685

The hydrogel characteristics and appreciable swelling of the polymer in aqueous medium are the key enabling factors; electrolyte absorbed in the polymer matrix is likely to be involved in the electrocatalytic process. Nanocomposite thin films of chitosan spin-cast on common conducting substrates, with an optimal content of NiO and [Ni,Fe]O nanoplates generated through a facile and simple in situ protocol, are shown to effect OER with excellent overpotentials (down to 240 mV at 10 mA/cm(2)), low Tafel slope, high Faradaic efficiency, appreciable turn-over frequency, and extended stability with high current density.

Results show that NiCu steel transformed from the anodic dissolution in the early stage of immersion to a metastable passive state in the final stage as the open-circuit potential value shifted positively, which was aroused by the precipitation of corrosion products. This process was mainly promoted by the trace amount of oxygen. Simultaneously, dominant cathodic reaction transformed from the hydrogen evolution in early stage to reduction processes of corrosion products in later stages. Possible corrosion processes were discussed with the assistance of a corresponding Pourbaix diagram. Copyright (C) 2015, The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.

The uncertainty in the 3alpha reaction at stellar energies due to the extrapolation from high-energy laboratory measurements is relatively small, but this is not the case for the C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction. Recent advances in the analysis of asteroseismological data on pulsating white dwarf stars now make it possible to obtain precise measurements of the central ratio of carbon to oxygen, providing a more direct way to measure the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate at stellar energies. We assess the systematic uncertainties of this approach and quantify small shifts in the measured central oxygen abundance originating from the observations and from model settings that are kept fixed during the optimization. Using new calculations of white dwarf internal chemical profiles, we find a rate for the C-12 (alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction that is significantly higher than most published values. The accuracy of this method might improve as we modify some of the details of our description of white dwarf interiors that were not accessible through previous model-fitting methods.									61	1	0	0	0	0	61			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000176663000031

Herein, a three-dimensional phosphorus-doped nickel molybdate/nickel molybdate hydrate @phosphates core-shell nanorod clusters on nickel foam self-supported electrode was fabricated by a combined hydrothermal and phosphating process. The phosphorus doping and phosphate coating induced by phosphating process bring in a synergistic effect to improve the electrical conductivity, provide abundant active surface sites and accelerate the surface reaction for nickel molybdate/nickel molybdate hydrate (NiMoO4/NiMoO4.nH(2)O) heterostructures. These advantages enable the self-supported electrode to exhibit high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in 1.0 M KOH with low overpotentials of 148 and 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. When it was employed both as anode and cathode, a cell voltage of 1.62 V is only required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution. Especially, the self-supported electrode reveals outstanding durability, which could maintain over 25 h at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER, OER or overall water splitting. This work provides a novel avenue to enhance the electrocatalytic performance of the catalysts by synergistically modulating the intrinsic electrical conductivity, active surface sites and surface reaction.

One road block lying in access to high catalytic performance of MoS2 emanates from the inert basal plane. To enable inert basal plane of flexible MoS2, we demonstrate an effective synthesis strategy via the progressive transformation of MoS2 to MoS2-xOx with O atomically dispersed under actual photo-catalytic hydrogen evolution condition. The rate of hydrogen production of new reconstructed MoS2-xOx nanosheets is improved to be much higher than that of the initial MoS2. Our theoretical calculation results indicate that the appropriate O substitution and strain could modulate the surface electronic state and optimize the Gibbs free energy (Delta G(H)) of MoS2, thus dramatically accelerating the catalytic efficiency. This work showcases a promising route to achieve tunable photochemical reconstruction by optimizing the electronic structure for low-cost and robust MoS2-based HER catalysts.									91	3	0	0	22	0	91			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623281800004

Herein, by doping copper with Isoreticular metal-organic framework-3 (IRMOF-3) as a precursor, an effective electrocatalyst with x%Cu/IRMOF-3 (x = 1%-10%) porous carbon spheres were prepared and characterized. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic properties of x%Cu/IRMOF-3 were investigated. According to the findings, 5%Cu/IRMOF-3-900 has a superior performance with a low overpotential of 265 mV and strong long-term stability in alkaline solution. With a porous structure and high nitrogen content, 5%Cu doped IRMOF-3 is superior to several reported precious metal-free electrocatalysts developed of MOFs. In this research, MOF has been utilized as a template to design a new approach for developing non-noble metal OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000790537300001

Herein, the reduction-engraved strategy was adopted to treat crystalline ferrite nanoparticles, which are highly dispersed on graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. This reduction treatment generated abundant oxygen vacancies on the surface of nano-scale ferrites and dramatically enhanced their surface area, ensuring that the ferrite nanoparticles possess more accessible active sites for OER, and improve their electronic conductivity. Reduced cobalt/nickel ferrite (Co0.5Ni0.5Fe2O4, r-CNF), cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4, r-CF) and nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4, r-NF) nanoparticles anchoring on the ultrathin GO nanosheets can act as highly active, stable and low-cost OER electrocatalysts in 1.0 M KOH solution. The r-CNF (Co : Ni = 1 : 1) on GO (r-CNFg) shows the best OER performance among the ferrite-based OER electrocatalysts, with an overpotential of 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, much more efficient than that of a commercial benchmark catalyst IrO2 (230 mV). The catalytic current density of r-CNFg at 1.49 V vs. RHE is about 50 times higher than that of CNF and CNFg. Also, it exhibits prominent electrochemical stability over 500 h in 1.0 M KOH.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			2052-1553			WOS:000425032100003

The synthesis of Au@Zn-MOF is confirmed by UV-Vis, FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The Au@Zn-MOF catalyst demonstrates electrocatalytic activity towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The relative catalytic performance of Au@Zn-MOF towards ORR and HER has been studied under acidic condition. ORR proceeds via a two electron and two proton mechanism with hydrogen peroxide as the end product, while HER follows the Volmer mechanism i.e., adsorption of H+ on the catalyst's active sites. Au@Zn-MOF exhibits an ORR onset potential of 0.45V (vs. RHE) with two different Tafel slopes, -93 and -103.6 mV in acidic solution. Further, an excellent catalytic activity is observed for HER with an onset potential of 0.02 V (vs. RHE) and a Tafel slope of 87 mV in N-2 saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. However, in O-2 saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution, a HER onset potential of 0.04 V (vs. RHE) is observed with two different Tafel slopes, 610 and 220 mV. The value of Tafel slopes in the presence of O-2 advocates the diminution of the ORR activity because of the HER. Thus, Tafel slope values of HER and ORR suggest that protons and O-2 compete to reach the electrode surface for getting reduced.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			2196-0216			WOS:000444225300015

To this end, a cost-effective and highly active FeNiPS3/graphite layer (FeNiPS3/GL) sandwich-structure was designed and prepared by in situ transforming ferric and nickel chloride-based graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) through a solid-state reaction for catalyzing the OER. The obtained sandwich-structured FeNiPS3/GL catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 223 mV, a small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1), and durable stability. The outstanding performance of FeNiPS3/GL may be due to the coupling effect, the sandwich-structure and the active Ni doping that facilitate electron transfer, suppress the aggregation of FeNiPS3 and expose a massive number of edge active sites for enhancing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. The FeNiPS3/GL assembled ZAB also presents durable stability for 175 h and a stable energy efficiency of 61.9% for practical application. Therefore, the sandwich-structured FeNiPS3/GL optimizes the unexposed active sites, semiconducting nature and the inert basal plate shortages of metal phosphorus trisulfides, and provides a reference value for exploring more metal phosphorus trisulfides through in situ transformation of GICs as efficient catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000797065500001

This integrated cathode architecture eliminates the negative effects of a conductive carbon additive and binder on the electrochemical performance of Li-O-2 batteries and minimizes the processing steps in fabrication of cathodes for Li-O(2 )batteries. The porous Ni foam acts as a scaffold and current collector, and the highly hierarchical porous flower-like structure of the binary Mn/Co oxide sheet acts as a highly active catalyst. Together, they facilitate effective diffusion of oxygen gas as well as rapid ion and electron conduction during electrochemical reactions. When assembled in Li-O-2 cells, the prepared catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic activities, including the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. In particular, the Li-O-2 cell using the cathode delivers an extremely high specific discharge capacity of 9690 mAh g(-1) under a applied specific current of 200 mA g(-1) and operate successfully in a long lifespan of 66 cycles even under a high specific current of 600 mA g(-1) and a limited discharge-charge capacity mode of 1000 mAh g(-1). The simultaneous effect of the fast electron transport kinetics provided by the free-standing structure and the high catalytic activity of the binary Mn/Co oxide show promise for use in air electrodes for Li-O-2 batteries.									4	1	0	0	0	0	4			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000542949400084

A promising direction is to utilize transition metal-based nanoparticles (NPs), which offer superior electrocatalytic performance over their bulk counterparts. Capping the surface of NPs with polymers is widely recognized as an effective means towards their dispersion and stabilization. However, it is often circumvented due to its tendency to lower the electrocatalytic activity of the ligated NPs. Here, we report the first systematic investigation into the impact of the chain density and hydrophilicity of the surface-capping polymers, which can be judiciously regulated, on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. By capitalizing on star-like diblock copolymers as nanoreactors, spinel CoFe2O4 (CFO) NPs permanently ligated with polymers of interest (i.e., varied chain density and characteristic) are crafted. The correlation between the chain density and hydrophilicity of surface-capping polymers and the OER activity of CFO NPs are scrutinized. Intriguingly, decreasing the number of surface-capping chains and increasing the chain hydrophilicity result in significantly decreased overpotential, caused by an increased exposure of the active material (CFO) to the electrolyte and reduced diffusion resistance. This study provides insight into the strategies for mitigating the activity-limiting properties of surface polymers and tailoring the electrocatalytic properties of polymer-ligated NPs.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000677739100001

In this work, a series of novel Mo anchored N-doped carbon catalysts (denoted as Mo/NC-T) were prepared starting from the zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 (ZIF-8) precursor. Firstly, Mo doped ZIF-8 precursor (Mo/ZIF-8) with a regular polyhedron structure was formed through a simple ion-exchange method process between molybdenum pentachloride (MoCl5) and ZIF-8. Afterward, Mo/ZIF-8 was converted to Mo/NC-T through a two-step calcination process in nitrogen (N-2) and ammonia (NH3). The as-synthesized Mo/NC-T samples exhibited superior electrocatalytic OER properties. The optimal sample at 650 degrees C (Mo/NC-650) presented a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1), and an outstanding long-term stability for 30 h in 1 M KOH solution. The remarkable OER activity of Mo/NC-T could be ascribed to the structural stability of carbon matrix and the synergistic effect between Mo3+ (derived from Mo-C bonds) and pyridinic N. This work provides a novel perspective on the roles of Mo species in the N-doped carbon electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Its electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction and corrosion resistance was evaluated by anodic polarization curves and accelerated corrosion test, respectively. The microscopic morphologies of the anode section and anodic oxidation layer during accelerated corrosion test were obtained by scanning electron microscopy. It is found that the composite anode (hard anodizing) displays a more compact interfacial combination and a better adhesive strength than plating tin. Compared with industrial Pb-0.3%Ag anodes, the oxygen evolution overpotentials of Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (hard anodizing) and Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (plating tin) at 500 A center dot m(-2) were lower by 57 and 14 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the corrosion rates of Pb-0.3%Ag alloy, Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (hard anodizing), and Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (plating tin) were 13.977, 9.487, and 11.824 g center dot m(-2)center dot h(-1), respectively, in accelerated corrosion test for 8 h at 2000 A center dot m(-2). The anodic oxidation layer of Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (hard anodizing) is more compact than Pb-0.3%Ag alloy and Al/Pb-0.3%Ag alloy (plating tin) after the test.									12	6	0	0	0	0	14			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000325805300011

Herein we report a facile method for the in-situ growth of iron/nickel phosphides hybrid on nickel foam via direct phosphorization of nickel foam after treated by iron nitrate aqueous solution. The optimal sample exhibits superior hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activities with low overpotentials of 63 and 185 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and small Tafel slopes of 59 and 47 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH, respectively. The corresponding two-electrode cell demands 1.567 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) without iR compensation. It can deliver a large current density of around 113 mA cm(-2) without decay during the electrolysis at 2 V for 24 h. The morphological, structural and component evolution of the as-prepared iron/nickel phosphides hybrid are systematically investigated. The synergistic effect between Ni2P and FeP and the formation of three-dimensional iron and nickel (oxy)hydroxides as real catalytic active sites play an important role in significantly improving the electrocatalytic activity.

Modification of electronic structure and support effect are powerful tools for boosting ORR performance of Pd-based catalysts. Herein, phosphorus (P) doped-palladium sulfide (Pd4S) nanoparticles decorated on P/sulfur (S) co-doped reduced graphene oxide (P-Pd4S/PSG) is prepared via a one-step solvothermal method using triphenylphosphine sulfide as both P and S sources. The incorporation of P effectively tailors the electronic structure and coordination environment of Pd4S, while P-Pd4S decorated on PSG generates strong metal-support interaction, which synergistically promotes electrocatalytic performance towards ORR. The proposed synthetic method offers a feasible route for the rational construction of heteroatoms-doped carbon - metal composites with highperformance for ORR and other potential energy applications.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000729374700002

However, there is still a lack of convenient ways to tune the surface electric field to selectively boost the catalytic conversions of different types of reactants in specific catalytic reactions. Here, we introduce a conceptually new method to tune the surface electric field of electrode materials by adjusting the number and density of heterojunctions inside. Both theoretical and experimental results prove that the well-designed surface electric field of an electrocatalyst plays a key role in facilitating pre-adsorption and/or activation of reactants for selective conversion of trash ions to useful products in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions as well as NOx- reduction reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000741505000001	34936146	
J	Eftekhari, Ali								Tuning the electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS TODAY ENERGY				5				37	57		10.1016/j.mtener.2017.05.002				SEP 2017	2017	Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the central reactions in the realm of electrochemistry and has been subject to numerous studies over centuries, but still one of the most complicated electrochemical processes and is of practical importance. It has attracted considerable attention quite recently because of its critical role in various energy storage and conversation systems. However, the quest for finding the most efficient electrocatalysts is still undergoing, and various materials and designs have been recently tested to improve the OER efficiency. By surveying the literature, the present paper concludes that the most reasonable design for the practical development of the OER electrocatalysts is based on a carbon catalyst support and transition metal compounds decorated by metallic catalysts. Based on the available reports, the key features, which are beneficial for improving the OER efficiency, are summarized. Furthermore, since the OER is based on a series of adsorption processes as pseudocapacitance is, it is demonstrated that electrode materials with stronger pseudocapacitive behaviors are more likely to deliver better OER performance.

Herein, we report an interesting bifunctional HER and ORR electrocatalyst of Fe/Fe3C@N-doped-carbon porous hierarchical polyhedrons (Fe/Fe3C@N-C) by a simple metal-organic framework precursor route. The Fe/Fe3C@N-C polyhedrons consisting of Fe and Fe3C nanocrystals enveloped by N-doped carbon shells and accompanying with some carbon nanotubes on the surface were prepared by thermal annealing of Zn-3[Fe(CN)(6)](2)center dot xH(2)O polyhedral particles in nitrogen atmosphere. This material exhibits a large specific surface area of 182.5 m(2) g(-1) and excellent ferromagnetic property. Electrochemical tests indicate that the Fe/Fe3C@N-C hybrid has apparent HER activity with a relatively low overpotential of 236 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 59.6 mV decade(-1). Meanwhile, this material exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward ORR with an onset potential (0.936 V vs. RHE) and half-wave potential (0.804 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH, which is comparable to commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (0.975 V and 0.820 V), and shows even better stability than the Pt/C.

Both carbon and nitrogen source metabolisms into cells are taken into account by the model. A kinetic reaction network is proposed, using lumping of several compounds into groups for a simplification of the metabolic pathways. Seven reactions are taken into account in the simplified reaction network, involving 11 different species; kinetic equations of Monod type for the reactions involved in the network considered are assumed. A stoichiometric study yields seven key components, the kinetic model is formulated as a set of differential equations formed by the production rates of the seven key components (six equations only if the pseudo-steady state is assumed for ATP), while the evolution of the other components involved in the reaction network are derived. Simulations of different cases in a stirrer tank bioreactor have been made, using a linear increase of stirrer speed, at different dissolved oxygen concentrations and with several initial nitrogen concentrations. The model is able to simulate the system evolution under different operational conditions, predicting an optimum value for the initial nitrogen concentration.									9	1	0	0	7	0	10			0378-4754	1872-7166		WOS:A1996VQ96000009

Here, we, for the first time, use abundantly available peanut shells as precursors and small amount of iron and nickel salts as non-precious metal sources to successfully synthesize FeNi alloy and nitrogen-codoped porous carbon (FeNi-NC) electrocatalyst. The as-synthesized FeNi-NC catalyst exhibits not only excellent ORR electrocatalytic activities with almost the same onset (0.98 V, versus RHE) and half-wave potentials (0.83 V, versus RHE) and limiting current as commercial 20% Pt/C, but also satisfactory OER performance with the similar activity with IrO2 in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, the overpotential (E-OER-E-ORR) of the FeNi-NC electrocatalyst is 0.81 V, which is smaller than the 20% Pt/C and IrO2 system. Interestingly, a home-made Zn-air battery with FeNi-NC as oxygen electrode displays an excellent charging and discharging polarization curves and robust cycle stability, which is superior to the 20% Pt/C+IrO2-based one. This work provides a facile route to change waste peanut shells into non-precious metal and nitrogen-codoped porous carbons as a valuable bi-functional oxygen electrocatalyst for rechargeable Zn-air batteries.									132	10	0	0	4	0	134			2405-8297			WOS:000428083400033

Herein, we report a facile and green method to synthesize graphene-like Co, N dual-doped porous carbon with densely populated and welldispersed Co-N-x sites by pyrolyzing a sodium chloride (NaCl) salt template wrapped with Co-absorbed polydopamine (PDA) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A second annealing treatment is proposed as an effective method to further enhance the electrocatalytic performance. The resulting 3D-Co-N-C-annealing catalysts exhibit superior catalytic activities with a small overpotential gap, favorable kinetics, and outstanding long-term stability as a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyzer. Moreover, ZABs assembled with 3D-Co-N-C-annealing catalysts present a large power density of 103.2 mW cm(-2), a high specific capacity of 895 mA h g(-1), and long-term charge-discharge durability (over 65 h), outperforming those afforded by the benchmark noble-metal catalyst combination (Pt/C + RuO2). This work demonstrates a low-cost, ecofriendly, and scalable salt template method coupled with a second annealing treatment to synthesize well-dispersed Co, N codoped porous carbon as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, which can provide inspiration on developing efficient carbon-based catalysts for the practical application of next-generation energy conversion and storage systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000711236300114

However, they cannot drive the required current density at a lower overpotential (eta) compared to other benchmark catalysts. To overcome the lack of efficient catalytic activity, Co3O4-embedded nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) is fabricated on NiO nanosheets derived from an in situ synthesized Co MOF with an electrodeposited (Ni(OH)(2)) layer. The electrocatalyst developed herein comprises many Co3+, Ni3+, and pyridinic-N-exposed active centers and exhibits an excellent synergistic effect between the metal oxide-NC-metal oxide, facilitating a highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the highly intimate contact between the electrocatalyst layers, rapid electron transfer occurs and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is produced in the HER and OER at eta of 73 and 110 mV, respectively, with excellent mass activity and high turnover frequency. However, urea-assisted water electrolysis achieves current densities of10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of just 1.31 and 1.49 V, respectively, for the two-electrode-based system, with an extremely stable durability of 212 h (1.49 V). Co3O4@NC/NiO parallel to Co3O4@NC/NiO has a considerably better urea electrolysis performance than other benchmark electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000780101700001

The distinct phases of interlinked nano-spherical Ni-P compounds (Ni2P, Ni2P/Ni12P5, and Ni12P5) were obtained at 140 degrees C with different reaction time periods. The Ni2P exhibits supreme specific capacity of 206 mA h g(-1) (1354 F g(-1)) at 5 mA cm(-2), which seems to be the highest among the Ni2P reported so far. Biomass-derived activated carbon was prepared as a negative electrode (135 F g(-1) at 1 mA cm(-2)) to fabricate a flexible supercapattery gadget, which delivered remarkable energy density and power density of 42 W h kg(-1) and 2856 W kg(-1) respectively, at 3 mA cm(-2) even after 10000 cycles. The Ni-P coated carbon cloth has shown immense mechanical strength and durability, which was tempting to use for electrocatalytic application. Both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction trials resulted in the evolution of an enormous amount of gas bubbles with low overpotentials of 278 and 234 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Hence, the dominant Ni-P electrodes were made multifunctional by demonstrating its potential application for efficient appliances.									45	5	0	0	1	0	46			2574-0962			WOS:000458705000014

Here, we designed and fabricated hetero-structured TiO2/Fe2TiO5 hollow microspheres with single-, double-, closed-double-, triple-, and core-shell structures and different Fe/Ti molar ratios using a facile sequential templating approach. The closed-double-shelled TiO2/Fe2TiO5 hollow microspheres with 35% Fe exhibited the highest oxygen evolution reaction rate up to 375 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) and good stability for 5 h. The high performance can be attributed to the closed-double shell, which had more reactive sites and greater light-harvesting ability, self-supported thin shells with short charge-transfer paths, and a favorable staggered band alignment between the TiO2 and Fe2TiO5.									81	9	0	0	11	0	81			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000413100400029

The stability of zirconium oxycarbide nanopowders (ZrO0.31C0.69), synthesized via a hybrid solid-liquid route, is investigated in different gas atmospheres from room temperature to 800 degrees C by using in-situ X-ray diffraction and in-situ electrical impedance spectroscopy. To feature the properties of a structurally stable Zr oxycarbide with high oxygen content, a stoichiometry of ZrO0.31C0.69 has been selected. ZrO0.31C0.69 is stable in reducing gases with only minor amounts of tetragonal ZrO2 being formed at high temperatures, whereas it decomposes in CO2 and O-2 gas atmosphere. From online differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) onset potential is determined at -0.4 V-RHE. CO2 formation is detected at potentials as positive as 1.9 V-RHE as ZrO0.31C0.69 decomposition product, and oxygen is anodically formed at 2.5 V-RHE, which shows the high electrochemical stability of this material in acidic electrolyte. This peopwery makes the material suited for electrocatalytic reactions at anodic potentials, such as CO and alcohol oxidation reactions, in general.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000477158600001	31247128

Nickel foam was modified as a substrate using spindle-like CoeFe LDH. XRD, FE-SEM, EDS, and elemental mapping techniques are used for characterization. Based on LSV results, overpotentials of 280 and 355 mV were obtained at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. To evaluate the stability of electrocatalyst, cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry (at constant potentials of 1.55 and 1.65 V vs. RHE), and chronopotentiometry (at applied current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2)) methods are used. All stability tests were performed consecutively using one electrode. Current density increased by 0.05% after performing 500 CV cycles. The catalytic performance was enhanced during the chronoamperometry analysis. However, the potential decreased slightly by less than 0.44% after 7200 s at 100 mA cm(-2) in chronopotentiometry analysis. The high durability and current density ensure the efficient performance of the as-prepared electrocatalyst in water splitting process. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, their formation mechanisms have remained elusive for decades because the Fe-N bond formation process always convolutes with uncontrolled carbonization and nitrogen doping during high-temperature treatment. Here, we elucidate the FeN4 site formation mechanisms through hosting Fe ions into a nitrogen-doped carbon followed by a controlled thermal activation. Among the studied hosts, the ZIF-8-derived nitrogen-doped carbon is an ideal model with well-defined nitrogen doping and porosity. This approach is able to deconvolute Fe-N bond formation from complex carbonization and nitrogen doping, which correlates Fe-N bond properties with the activity and stability of FeN4 sites as a function of the thermal activation temperature.									240	25	0	0	12	0	242			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000495516300001	31633848

Herein, we report a metallic (V) and nonmetallic (F) double doping in Co3O4 with nanoneedles structure, which is synthesized through facile oil bath and annealing. Electrochemical measurements show that the Co3O4 dopped with fluorine and vanadium (F-0.2-V-Co3O4-350) only needs a low overpotential of 320 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is superior to commercial RuO2. The excellent electrocatalytic performance can be attributed to double doping of vanadium and fluorine which have strong electron absorption effect to optimize the density of electrons in Co3O4. Besides, nanoneedles structure can enlarge exposure of active sites. And its great durability is evaluated through 2000 cycles CV test. Furthermore, the optimal ratio of fluorine to vanadium and different annealing temperatures of the target catalyst are explored reasonably. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Among the conventionally used platinum-based heterogeneous catalysts, the high consumption but low utilization efficiency of precious platinum is one of the most crucial issues. Herein we present a facile approach to prepare an effective HER catalyst with platinum atom clusters highly dispersed in WO3@CFC (carbon fiber cloth). The fabricated Pt/def-WO3@CFC electrocatalyst shows an overpotential of 42 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4, which is highly comparable to that of the state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C catalysts (34 mV), and more attractively, largely enhanced mass activity of Pt and excellent electrochemical stability compared to that of commercial Pt/C. The excellent HER performance of Pt/def-WO3@CFC is attributed to the synergetic catalytic effect between highly dispersed Pt atom clusters and WO3 nanoplates with oxygen vacancies, which enhances both electrocatalytic activity and durability.									86	5	0	0	2	0	88			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400039

Then, Nickel is electro-reduced into graphene nanosheets on carbon paper and also on the bare carbon paper to use in alkaline media for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Afterward, graphene and Ni-graphene are characterized using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical technique. SEM images show the Cauliflower structure of Ni in the absence of graphene and nanoparticle shapeless in the presence of smooth graphene. The electrochemical results show an excellent catalytic activity of Ni-graphene/ carbon paper with an over potential of 90 mV (Versus Ag/AgCl), which is lower than the literature value for Ni in alkaline electrolyte for HER (120 mV dec(-1)). The effect of graphene support on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy response, activation energy and HER activity of the samples are investigated carefully. Finally, we prepare a novel gas diffusion electrode by using Ni pasted on carbon paper for the ORR in fuel cells and compared it with standard Pt/C catalysts using linear sweep voltammetry.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2053-1591		WOS:000533263700001

Typically, these materials are prepared by conventional ceramic routes that are energy consuming and offer limited control over shape and size. Moreover, for mixed-metal oxide spinels (for example, CoxMn3-xO4), the crystallographic phase sensitively correlates with the metal ratio, posing great challenges to synthesize active product with simultaneously tuned phase and composition. Here we report a general synthesis of ultrasmall cobalt manganese spinels with tailored structural symmetry and composition through facile solution-based oxidationprecipitation and insertion-crystallization process at modest condition. As an example application, the nanocrystalline spinels catalyse the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions, showing phase and composition co-dependent performance. Furthermore, the mild synthetic strategy allows the formation of homogeneous and strongly coupled spinel/carbon nanocomposites, which exhibit comparable activity but superior durability to Pt/C and serve as efficient catalysts to build rechargeable Zn-air and Li-air batteries.									423	25	0	0	29	1	431			2041-1723			WOS:000357173300004	26040417

The monolayered MoS2 NDs were hydrothermally pre-synthesized and acted as size-controlled precursors. By varying the content of the MoS2 NDs, a series of MoS2 NDs/NGr was obtained, which displayed amendable activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in basic solution, due to the balance between the exposed edge sites of the MoS2 NDs and the internal conductive channels of the 3D porous NGr. The optimal composition generated an efficient Pt-free ORR catalyst with good four-electron selectivity, and was shown to have a more positive shift in both the onset and peak potentials than its counterparts. The novel catalyst also demonstrated superior tolerance against methanol and better durability than commercial Pt/C.									53	5	0	0	2	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000351845400052

Developing highly efficient and non-precious catalytic materials is essential to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of OER. However, currently used catalyst supports, such as copper foam, suffer from inferior corrosion resistance and structural stability, resulting in the disabled functionality of 3D conductive networks. To this end, a novel 3D freestanding electrode with corrosion-resistant and robust Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy lattice as the catalyst support is designed via a 3D printing technology of selective laser melting. After the coating of core-shell Cu(OH)2@CoNi carbonate hydroxides (CoNiCH) on the designed lattice, a unique micro/nano-sized hierarchical porous structure is formed, which endows the electrocatalyst with a promising electrocatalytic activity (a low overpotential of 355 mV at 30 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 125.3 mV dec(-1)). Computational results indicate that the CoNiCH exhibits optimized electron transfer and the catalytic activity of the Ni site is higher than that of the Co site in the CoNiCH. Therefore, the integration of robust catalyst supports and highly active materials opens up an avenue for reliable and high-performance OER electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000827805200001	35859255

Templated chemical vapor deposition is a favorable strategy to fabricate this kind of graphene, but the number of effective templates is limited. Here, silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO-34) zeolite crystals were used as the catalytic templates for the deposition of hierarchical porous graphene. The graphene obtained consisted of micron. size hollow cubes with mesoporous/nanoporous facets, and ultrathin walls, precisely replicating the structure of the cube-like SAPO-34 zeolite particles. A high doping level of nitrogen (6. 84 at%) was achieved by subsequent annealing at 700. under ammonia before template removal. Because of the unique porosity, abundant defects, and favorable N-doping, the N. doped graphene exhibited considerable reactivity for both ORR and OER.									10	2	0	0	0	0	11			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000423505900003

Exploring inexpensive and efficient electrocatalytic materials for OER is a hot spot of research. Herein, Co-doped nickel selenide (Co-NiSe) nanoflowers are solvothermally in-situ grown on nickel foam (NF), which acts as a robust catalytic electrode for OER. In 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the required overpotential is 380 mV to reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The Tafel slope is 111.0 mV dec(-1). A long-term catalytic stability for OER is obtained. Cobalt doping not only produces more catalytically active sites for OER, but also promotes charge transport through electronic interaction with NiSe. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

However, the sluggish kinetics at the anode for water splitting makes the highly effective and inexpensive electrocatalysts desirable in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by structure and composition modulations. Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively used as the templates/precursors to synthesize complex hollow structures for various energy-related applications. Herein, an effective and facile template-engaged strategy originated from bimetal MOFs is developed to construct hollow microcubes assembled by interconnected nanopolyhedron, consisting of intimately dominant FeNi alloys coupled with a small NiFe2O4 oxide, which was confined within carbonitride outer shell (denoted as FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC) via one-step annealing treatment. The optimized FeNi/NiFe2O4@NC exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances toward OER in alkaline media, showing 10 mA.cm(-2) at eta = 316 mV, lower Tafel slope (60 mV.dec(-1)), and excellent durability without decay after 5000 CV cycles, which also surpasses the IrO2 catalyst and most of non-noble catalysts in the OER, demonstrating a great perspective. The superior OER performance is ascribed to the hollow interior for fast mass transport, in situ formed strong coupling between FeNi alloys and NiFe2O4 for electron transfer, and the protection of carbonitride layers for long stability.									103	10	0	0	5	0	104			1944-8244			WOS:000390728900027	27935299

A controlled bulk molar fraction of Ru or Sn was introduced in the IrO2 lattice during the synthesis with no phase separation. The electrocatalytic activity of the synthesized oxides in the OER was studied in liquid electrolyte using porous rotating-disk electrodes, in "half-cell" configuration and in a 5 cm(2) proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis cell.

And compared with the conventional powdery catalysts, the freestanding electrode architecture is more attractive owing to the enhanced kinetics and stability. In this work, we report an electrospinning-carbonization-post oxidation strategy to develop the freestanding N-doped carbon nano -fibers anchored with Ni/NiO nanoparticles (denoted as Ni/NiO-NCNFs) as efficient OER electrocatalyst. In the synthesized Ni/NiO-NCNFs, the conductive ultrathin carbon layer could promote electron transfer and thus improve the electrocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, the ratio between Ni and NiO could be regulated by tuning the oxidation duration, so as to optimize the adsorption energy of intermediates and improve the OER activity. The Ni/NiO-NCNFs prepared with the oxidation time of 3 h exhibit a promising OER activity and long-term operation durability in 0.1 M KOH solution, requiring an overpotential as small as 153 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Its overpotential is far lower than that of the reported OER catalysts. This work offers an efficient pathway to develop low-cost and highly active freestanding transitional metal-based OER electrocatalyst for potential renewable electrochemical energy conversion.

The structure, morphology and oxidation state of the catalysts are systematically studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, high resolution transmission electron microscope and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A nearly 4-electron assisted oxygen reduction is followed by ZnCo2O4 with onset potential at 0.81 V (vs. RHE). However, when the ZnCo2O4 flowers are embedded onto the RGO sheet, a nearly 4-electron pathway for oxygen reduction is achieved with onset potential at 0.95 V (vs. RHE). The formation of H2O2 is significantly reduced in RGO-ZnCo2O4 than bare ZnCo2O4 as detected at the tip in the scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) during electrochemical reduction. The oxygen evolution study revealed that the overpotential of 0.30 V (vs. RHE) is required in RGO-ZnCo2O4 for overcoming the benchmark current density (10 mA/cm(2)). The SECM study enables to detect local depletion of oxygen at the SECM tip during the redox transition facilitating the in-situ observation of the initial steps of OER.

In this work, we demonstrate the non-pollution fabrication of porous carbon self-doped with N and P heteroatoms from spirulina, a kind of industrially cultivated microalgae which is rich in proteins and phosphates. The N, P self-doped biocarbon (NPBC) was obtained simply by pyrolyzing spirulina at 950 degrees C. This single-step process eliminates additional chemicals including nitrogen source, phosphorus source, and pore-forming agents, thus allowing NPBC to become a true sense of potentially low-cost and sustainable oxygen electrocatalysts. NPBC exhibits large specific surface area (786.1 m(2)/g), improved pore volume (0.73 cm(3)/g), and doping levels of 2.15% for N and 0.97% for P (atom ratio). And it can deliver bifunctional activity in catalyzing both oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, with a small OER and ORR metrics (Delta E = 0.82 V). Using NPBC for the air electrodes, we develop primary and rechargeable zinc-air battery with a high discharge power density of 90.7 mW cm(-2) and a large energy density of 850 Wh kg(-1) in ambient air conditions. Moreover, the rechargeable zinc-air battery shows good rechargeability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									32	2	0	0	2	0	32			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000414067900029

In this work, porous structured ternary nickel-iron-phosphide (Ni-Fe-P) nanocubes were synthesized through one-step phosphidation of a Ni-Fe-based Prussian blue analogue. The Ni-Fe-P nanocubes exhibit a rough and loose porous structure on their surface under suitable phosphating temperature, which is favorable for the mass transfer and oxygen diffusion during the electrocatalysis process. As a result, Ni-Fe-P obtained at 350 degrees C with poorer crystallinity offers more unsaturated atoms as active sites to expedite the absorption of reactants. Additionally, the introduction of nickel improved the electronic structure and then reduced the charge-transfer resistance, which would result in a faster electron transport and an enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activities. Benefiting from the unique porous nanocubes and the chemical composition, the Ni-Fe-P nanocubes exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities in alkaline medium, with low overpotentials of 182 and 271 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the Ni-Fe-P nanocubes show outstanding stability for sustained water splitting in the two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer. This work not only provides a facile approach for designing bifunctional electrocatalysts but also further extends the application of metal-organic frameworks in overall water splitting.									173	4	0	0	4	0	177			1944-8244			WOS:000407540400052	28718291

Although recent progress has enabled the preparation of single nanoframe structures with a variety of morphologies, more complex nanoframe structures such as a double-layered nanoframe have not yet been realized. Herein, we report a rational synthetic strategy for a structurally robust Ir-based multimetallic double-layered nanoframe (DNF) structure, nanoframe@nanoframe. By leveraging the differing kinetics of dual Ir precursors and dual transition metal (Ni and Cu) precursors, a core shell-type alloy@alloy structure could be generated in a simple one-step synthesis, which was subsequently transformed into a multimetallic IrNiCu DNF with a rhombic dodecahedral morphology via selective etching. The use of single Ir precursor yielded single nanoframe structures, highlighting the importance of employing dual Ir precursors. In addition, the structure of Ir-based nanocrystals could be further controlled to DNF with octahedral morphology and CuNi@Ir core shell structures via a simple tuning of experimental factors. The IrNiCu DNF exhibited high electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media, which is better than Ir/C catalyst. Furthermore, IrNiCu DNF demonstrated excellent durability for OER, which could be attributed to the frame structure that prevents the growth and agglomeration of particles as well as in situ formation of robust rutile II, phase during prolonged operation.									176	7	0	0	8	0	178			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000404808000030	28599106

In this study, we shaped electrochemically Pt nanocrystals on highly boron doped diamond electrodes without adding surfactants or additives. Their shapes were controlled by varying deposition potential during electrodeposition process, as confirmed with high resolution scanning electron microscope. Their crystallography of Pt nanocrystals was analyzed through hydrogen adsorption/desorption behavior in acidic solutions. Oxygen reduction reactions on these nanocrystals were investigated, indicating shape dependence. The discussion on shaping mechanism reveals that hydrogen evolution reaction is deemed to be responsible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The zero resistivity appeared and the transition temperature T-c(zero) reached 8.5 K by the oxygen annealing at 200 degrees C. The shielding volume fraction was also enhanced from 0 to almost 100%. The lattice constants were compressed by the oxygen annealing, indicating that the evolution of bulk superconductivity in FeTe0.8S0.2 was correlated to the shrinkage of the lattice.

It has been reported that a favorable electronic structure and high electrical conductivity contribute to obtaining superior electrocatalytic activity for perovskites; thus, effective strategies for engineering abundant beneficial factors must be explored to enhance HER and OER. Hence, we report a novel two-step solid-state phase reaction method combined with bulk doping for constructing perovskite LaxSr1-xFe1-20yCo19yPyO3-delta-ab (LSFCP-ab) with modest B-O length and high electrical conductivity. Induced by the strong charge redistribution via Fe4+-O2-x-Co3+, abundant active sites (O-2(2-)/O-, Fe4+, Co3+/Co4+), moderate adsorption and desorption energies of the intermediates are obtained during OER and HER. Besides, the activated surface lattice oxygen O2-x could participate in the OER with lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM). Consequently, the optimal LSFCP-55 exhibits improved intrinsic OER and HER activity than that of La0.2Sr0.8FeO3-delta (LSF). Furthermore, the cell possesses a small cell voltage of 1.57 V with superior durability when it employed as the bifunctional catalyst in overall water splitting. This work provides a novel strategy to engineer beneficial electronic structures over perovskite oxides for sustainable energy conversion.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5				2639-4979		WOS:000683024500016

Herein manganese cobalt oxide nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanofibers and wrapped in a nitrogen-doped carbon shell (MCO/CNFs@NC) is successfully prepared. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the core nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped carbon shell, MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst exhibits oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with comparable onset potential (1.00 V vs RHE) and half-wave potential (0.76 V vs RHE) which is only about 40 mV lower than that of the state of art Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, the MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst exceeds the Pt/C catalyst by a great margin in terms of stability in alkaline media. Additionally, MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst is strongly tolerant to methanol crossover, promising its applicability as cathode catalyst in alcohol fuel cells. Moreover, MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst exhibits the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with low overpotential of 0.41 V at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and ORR/OER potential gap (Delta E) as low as 0.88 V, suggesting its strong bifunctionality. The Zn-air battery based on MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst is found to deliver a specific capacity of 695 mA h g(Zn)(-1) and an energy density of 778 W h kg(Zn)(-1) at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2). The mechanically rechargeable Zn-air battery based on MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst is also found to function continually by only reloading the consumed Zn anode and electrolyte. Furthermore, the electrically rechargeable battery based on MCO/CNFs@NC catalyst is found to function for more than 220 cycles with negligible loss of voltaic efficiency. Moreover, MCO/CNFs@NC is found to display a supercapacitive nature with a good discharge capacity of 478 F g(-1) at a discharge current density of 1 A g(-1).									33	2	0	0	0	0	34			2574-0962			WOS:000458705400027

To improve the electrochemical catalytic performance in the lithium-oxygen batteries, the NiCo2O4. nanoparticles (NCONPs) are firmly anchored onto the surface of the N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) by the hydrothermal method followed by low-temperature calcination. Compared with the pure metallic oxide, the introduction of the rGO can create the high surface area, which give a good performance for ORR (oxygen reduction reaction), and improve the electrical conductivity between the NCONPs. The high-loading NCONPs also ensure the material to have great catalytic activity for OER (oxygen evolution reaction), and the rGO can be protected by the nanoparticles coating against the side reaction with the Li2O2. The as-synthesized NCO@N-rGO composites deliver a specific surface area (about 242.5 m(2) g(-1)), exhibiting three-dimensional (3D) porous structure, which provides a large passageway for the diffusion of the oxygen and benefits the infiltration of electrolyte and the storage of the discharge products. Owing to these special architectures features and intrinsic materials, the NCO@N-rGO cathode delivers a high specific capacity (6716 mAh g(-1)), great rate performance, and excellent cycling stability with cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) (112 cycles) in the lithium-oxygen batteries. The improved electrochemical catalytic activity and the special 3D porous structure make the NCO@N-rGO composites be a promising candidate for Li-O-2 batteries.									52	4	0	0	2	0	52			1944-8244			WOS:000380298400034	27353228

For nanocarbon catalysts, it is still a challenge to prepare both atom-doped and defect-engineered catalysts with the desired more effective active centers, which requires an in-depth understanding of both experiment and theory. Herein, a topological rich-vacancy-defect nitrogen-doped nanocarbon (TRNC) material is constructed in situ via a simple magnesiothermic technology. It exhibits remarkable oxygen catalytic performance, which can be compared to the best metal-free bifunctional carbon electrocatalysts reported, even better than that of commercial noble-metal RuO2. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the carbon vacancy defects with edge nitrogen doping as intrinsic active sites were found to exhibit excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. When used practically as a catalyst in Li-O-2 batteries, with a capacity restriction of 500 mA h g(-1), it displays a long cycling and high rate durability of over 300 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). This excellent performance arises from the three-dimensional topological rich-vacancy-defect nitrogen-doped nanocarbon. The effects of vacancy sites and nitrogen doping were probed via first-principles simulations to clarify the catalytic mechanisms which contribute to this superior performance.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490235800030

The Co3O4 nanosheets were directly grown both on the surface of nickel foam and the large pores of GDL. Therefore, this approach avoided blocking active sites due to a binder, and enabled tailoring of the architecture and properties of the GDL, resulting in more exposed active sites, fast oxygen transport capability, and abundant triple-phase boundaries. Remarkably, benefitting from their unique architecture, the Co3O4/Ni/GDL electrodes exhibited high activity toward both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Application of the Co3O4/Ni/GDL electrodes as bifunctional electrodes for zinc-air batteries resulted in an ultrahigh capacity of 806 mAh/g(zn), high maximum power density of 162 mW/cm(2), and superior cycling stability over 425 h at 10 mA/cm(2) with a high energy efficiency of 68%. These properties were much better than those of Pt/C-based electrodes. Furthermore, the Co3O4/Ni/GDL-based flexible zinc-air battery also exhibited high mechanical flexibility and stability. Our findings thus open up a path for the design of highly efficient integrated air electrodes for metal-air batteries. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The synthesized MnCo2O4/NGr exhibits good oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) activity with half-wave potential E-1/2 of 0.85 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), comparable to commercial Pt/C with E-1/2 of 0.88 V (vs RHE) along with superior oxygen electrode activity Delta E = 0.91 V for the ORR/OER (oxygen-evolution reaction) in alkaline media. Durability tests confirm that MnCo2O4/NGr is more stable than Pt/C in alkaline environment.

It exhibits a low overpotential for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 11.53 mAh.cm(-2) at 0.04 mA.cm(-2), about 10 times that of pristine GF. The charge transfer resistance of GF is reduced by about 81% by CeFeO3, while the ORR and OER peak current densities are increased by 982 and 1167%, respectively. Furthermore, CeFeO3 can efficiently suppress the side reactions of GF to reduce the overpotential and improve the cycle performance during cycles. Multifarious results reveal that the superior catalytic activities of CeFeO3 and hierarchical porous structure are responsible for the excellent electrochemical performance. It paves a novel way to develop a multifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen electrodes by combining catalysis and microstructure using a green electrochemical method.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000857301200001

Sefcovic, Joel/X-6416-2019				Oxidative decomposition mechanisms of lithium peroxide clusters: an Ab Initio study								MOLECULAR PHYSICS				117	9-12	SI		1459	1468		10.1080/00268976.2018.1559955				JUN 18 2019	2019	Oxidative decomposition of solid lithium peroxide is an important part of the charging process in a Li-O-2 battery. In this paper, we investigate oxidative decomposition mechanisms of lithium peroxide clusters as molecular models for solid lithium peroxide using density functional methods to understand charging processes in advanced energy storage systems. Most calculations are done using a (Li2O2)(4) cluster with similar results obtained from a larger (Li2O2)(16) cluster. Reaction pathways of the clusters involving different sequences of oxidation, oxygen evolution, lithium cation removal, and spin excitation are investigated. The computations suggest that certain oxidative decomposition routes may not have dependence on the oxygen evolution or Li-ion removal kinetics due to the exothermicity of oxygen removal and Li+ removal (by solvent) upon oxidation. The computed charge potentials evaluated using a tetramer model indicates that it is possible to have low overcharge potential provided there exists a good electronic conductivity to facilitate the oxidative decomposition. Finally, oxidation potentials of a series of LixOy clusters are investigated to assess their dependence on stoichiometry and how the local site from which the electrons are being removed affects the charge potentials.[GRAPHICS].									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000468552600039		
J	Chen, Sheng; Wang, Yihan; Wang, Zhijun; Zhang, Kun								Advances in nonprecious metal catalysts for efficient water oxidation in alkaline media								IONICS											10.1007/s11581-022-04774-2		OCT 2022			2022	Fossil fuels are facing various challenges, such as global warming and depletion of fossil energy sources. Fortunately, hydrogen energy can be a green energy source for sustainable development. Hydrogen production from electrolytic water is one of the most efficient methods in the hydrogen energy industry; however, the realization of an efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the key to hydrogen production from electrolytic water. As a result, developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts with high activity and alkaline stability is critical. This article gives a focused evaluation of the most recent highly active oxygen evolution catalysts in this new research field. The mechanism of the OER catalyst in an alkaline environment is discussed first, followed by the fundamental needs of catalysts for the oxygen evolution process. Then, contemporary researchers' design alternatives for enhancing OER active materials are explored, as well as new developments and discoveries of current advanced noble metal-free active materials. Finally, the problems and future prospects for developing efficient catalyst systems for industrial applications are discussed. Future research directions are also pointed out for the preparation of resource-rich emerging nonprecious metal OER electrocatalysts in alkaline environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000869626000001

Here, the first systematic investigation of a family of Ni-rich layered LiNi1-xMxO2 (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) oxides reveals that the catalytic activity can be tuned by varying the Ni content, nature of the transition-metal dopant, lithium content, and degree of cation ordering between Li and Ni/M. In particular, Fe-doping in LiNi1-xMxO2 imparts the most dramatic improvements in OER activity, possibly due to the flexibility of Fe to adopt different coordination geometries on the surface. Xray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) data reveal that the surface of the Fe-doped sample is enriched with Fe while ex situ Raman spectroscopy indicates that the layered morphology is preserved during electrochemical cycling, but the cation disorder increases. Among the various LiNi1-xMxO2 compositions investigated, LiNi0.7Co0.3Fe0.2O2 exhibits the highest OER activity, which increases further when excess lithium and oxygen vacancies are present, and good stability. The Ni-rich LiNi1-xMxO2 samples join a growing number of highly active iron-doped systems for OER electrocatalysis in alkaline conditions.									40	0	0	0	0	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000359184200030

In this study, a novel BiVO4-Bi6O6(OH)(3)(NO3)(3) (BBN) heterostructure fabricates via a simple one-pot hydrothermal approach is certified to effectively restrain the recombination of carriers by efficient spatial charge separation. By employing BBN as a reductive-function photocatalyst, a solid-state Z-scheme is constructed to improve the photo-redox capacity of BiVO4 and hydrogen production is realized in the BiVO4-BBN heterostructure for the first time. The solid-state Z-scheme introduced in the BiVO4-BBN ensures the photoexcited carriers with the powerful redox capacity to participate in the photocatalytic reaction.

Herein, for the first time, we report a general urea-modulated hydrothermal phosphorization strategy to directly grow hierarchical CoMnP/Ni2P nanosheet-based microplate arrays on Ni foam (NF). Thanks to the unique hierarchical structure, CoP-MnP synergism, and superhydrophilicity and superaerophobicity of the CoMnP/Ni2P/NF arrays, the optimized CoMnP/Ni2P/NF shows high activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with low overpotentials in 0.5 M H2SO4 (HER: 84 mV; OER: 165 mV) and 1 M KOH (HER: 108 mV; OER: 209 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most of the reported electrocatalysts. Moreover, the assembled two-electrode electrolyzer with CoMnP/Ni2P/NF as both the anode and cathode delivers a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with robust stability in alkaline electrolyte. More importantly, highly active and stable overall water splitting in acidic medium on a non-noble bifunctional electrocatalyst is realized, and only 1.43 V cell voltage is required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density. This work not only creates an excellent non-noble bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in acidic and alkaline media, but also provides a universal and practical way to prepare other nanostructured metal phosphides for diverse electrocatalytic reactions.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000698749200001

However, electrochemically driven surface transformations complicate the identification of such descriptors. Here we demonstrate how the as-prepared surface composition of (001)-terminated LaNiO3 epitaxial thin films dictates the surface transformation and the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, the Ni termination (in the as-prepared state) is considerably more active than the La termination, with overpotential differences of up to 150 mV. A combined electrochemical, spectroscopic and density-functional theory investigation suggests that this activity trend originates from a thermodynamically stable, disordered NiO2 surface layer that forms during the operation of Ni-terminated surfaces, which is kinetically inaccessible when starting with a La termination. Our work thus demonstrates the tunability of surface transformation pathways by modifying a single atomic layer at the surface and that active surface phases only develop for select as-synthesized surface terminations.Structure-activity relationships built on descriptors of surfaces can help to design electrocatalysts, but their identification for electrochemically driven surface transformations is challenging. The composition of LaNiO3 thin film surfaces can now dictate surface transformation and activity of the oxygen evolution reaction.									49	2	0	0	2	0	49			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000607023400007	33432142

Linear scaling of the *OH and **OOH adsorption energies is proposed to limit the oxides' efficiency as OER catalysts, but the use of simple descriptors to screen candidate materials neglects potentially important water-water interactions. Here, we use a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), noncontact atomic force microscopy (ncAFM), and density functional theory (DFT)-based computations to show that highly stable HO-H2O dimer species form at the (1 (1) over bar 02) facet of hematite; a promising anode material for photoelectrochemical water splitting. The UHV-based results are complemented by measurements following exposure to liquid water and are consistent with prior X-ray scattering results. The presence of strongly bound water agglomerates is generally not taken into account in OER reaction schemes but may play a role in determining the required OER overpotential on metal oxides.									24	2	0	0	1	0	23			2380-8195			WOS:000458938400004

Herein, cobalt and iron oxide with hollow structure has been fabricated using ZIF-67 as template, via reflux process followed by calcination. The simultaneous structural and electronic modulation are achieved due to the homogenous Fe incorporation. The Co sites in higher oxidation states and Fe sites with higher electron density can enhance the adsorption of H2O molecules and OOH species, and thus promote the water oxidation. The unique hollow structure also facilitates the mass transfer at the interface of electrolyte and active atoms. The optimal cobalt and iron oxide hollow nanocages exhibit superior OER performance, delivering an ultralow overpotential of 274 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a very small Tafel slope of 31 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media, which outperform the state-of-the-art RuO2 .

The SnO2/Co3O4 nanosheets (SnO2/Co3O4 NSs) were enclosed on the surface of Mn3O4 nanorods (Mn3O4 NRs). The prepared materials were investigated as the catalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in alkaline. By contrast, the design of core-shell hierarchical nano composite of Mn3O4@SnO2/Co3O4 possesses the obvious electrocatalytic OER performance than others, showing the overpotential of approximately 420 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a low Tafel slope of 70.1 mV dec(-1), in which the interesting structure can provide the interfacial and cooperative effect between core (hierarchical SnO2/Co3O4 NSs) and shell (1D Mn3O4 NRs) that 1D Mn3O4 NRs can act as an electron acceptor and accelerates electron transfer, and that hierarchical SnO2/Co3O4 NSs provide a large specific surface area and multiple exposed surface active sites between electrode material and electrolyte.

In this work, nickel sulfide (Ni3S2), as an efficient pre-electrocatalyst, is developed by a facile, mild and in-situ electrochemical (EC) pretreatment for enhancement in HER activity. It is found that after the EC treatment, the required overpotential for HER greatly decreases from 288 mV (pristine-Ni3S2) to 169 mV (EC-Ni3S2) at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and is stable for over 25 h with nearly unchanged structure and chemical composition. Two possible mechanisms are suggested to explain this enhancement: (i) the oxygen-doped sulfur-deficient Ni3S2 (Ni3S2-xOx) layer should have been formed on the surface of Ni3S2 nanosheets, which brings about the electronic environment modulation, resulting in the optimized hydrogen (H*) adsorption/desorption and higher electrical conductivity; (ii) the developed nanosheets/microspheres structure with poor crystallinity increases the number of active sites in hydrogen generation. The promotion in HER performance of Ni3S2 electrocatalyst via EC pretreatment may exploit the potential for nickel sulfide and other transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) electrocatalysts to achieve high efficiency and stability for electrochemical energy conversion and storage.

The hydrophobicity of electrodes was measured by the contact angle, cyclic voltammetry and ac-impedance of PTFE-modified RuO2 electrodes. The morphologies of electrodes with various amount of PTFE were observed by using of SEM and AFM. The effects of PTFE-content on the electrochemical characteristics of PTFE-modified electrodes were carried out by the measurements of voltammetric charge, polarization and ac-impedance. The behavior of oxygen evolution and the performance of electrodes depended significantly on the hydrophobicity of PTFE-modified electrodes, and the electrode prepared from a dipping solution with 11.1 vol% PTFE had the best performance, i.e., the largest number of active sites and the highest site activity at low overpotential. The electrode prepared from a dipping solution with 20 vol% PTFE behaved the highest site activity at high overpotential. The facts that electrodes with higher PTFE-content retarded hydration of the electrode and processed a larger film resistance were also found, as indicated from the ac-impedance analysis, in this study.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0368-1653			WOS:A1997WR03900002

We used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to characterize very active manganese and cobalt oxide thin films deposited on FTO substrates before and after the application of different anodic potentials, in order to investigate the bias potential dependent changes on the catalysts' surfaces. alpha-Mn2O3 undergoes a reversible partial oxidation from Mn3+ to Mn4+ under high anodic potentials, while the transition from Co2+ to Co3+ in amorphous CoOx samples occurs already at a potential well below the OER onset potential. This Co3+ state is then stable throughout the investigated potential range and no clear evidence for a Co4+ state at or above the OER onset potential could be found. We conclude that the OER reaction mechanism on the surface of these oxide films might be significantly different.

Adouble phase Co-NSC composite was successfully synthesized by a new synthesis process rather than a single phase Nd0.5Sr0.5Co1.1O3-delta perovskite. The composite has good catalytic activity, high number of transferred electrons (3.9) compatible with Pt/C, and low concentration of the peroxide species (HO2-) yields (< 5%). Also, it shows the outperformed onset potential (0.576 V vs. Hg/HgO) of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at -2.0mA cm(-2), indicating higher current density than perovskite related catalysts such as Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF), La1.7Sr0.3NiO4 (LSN), LaNiO3 (LNO) and the state-of-the-art rutile IrO2. The good catalytic activity of Co-NSC is ascribed to the higher amount of Co3+ cations and higher O-ad/O-lattice ratio. Interestingly, the cyclic performance of the composite is also remarkably stable without observable degradation in a hybrid lithium air cell. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

In this study, we develop an effective strategy to enhance conductivity and buffer volume changes of TMOs, in which networked nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) are incorporated into Co3O4 nanosheets system. Based on the whole mass of Co3O4 and N-CNT, the composites can maintain a stable discharge capacity of similar to 590 mAh g(-1) after 80 cycles at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1). Moreover, the composites also exhibit greatly enhanced catalysis ability towards oxygen evolution reaction (OER), ie, small Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1), low overpotential of 310 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and almost no activity decay throughout 30-hour continuous operation. This study lays a new route for smartly designing advanced electrode materials for energy storage and electrochemical catalysis.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000422754000039

Tungsten carbide nanocrystals (approximate to 5 nm) are directly synthesized through the reaction of tungsten precursors with mesoporous graphitic C3N4 (mpg-C3N4) as the reactive template in a flow of inert gas at high temperatures. Systematic experiments that vary the precursor compositions and temperatures used in the synthesis selectively generate different compositions and structures for the final nanocarbide (W2C or WC) products. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that the WC phase with a high surface area exhibits both high activity and stability in hydrogen evolution over a wide pH range. The WC sample also shows excellent hydrogen oxidation activity, whereas its activity in oxygen reduction is poor. These tungsten carbides are successful cocatalysts for overall water splitting and give H2 and O2 in a stoichiometric ratio from H2O decomposition when supported on a Na-doped SrTiO3 photocatalyst. Herein, we present tungsten carbide (on a small scale) as a promising and durable catalyst substitute for platinum and other scarce noble-metal catalysts in catalytic reaction systems used for renewable energy generation.									157	10	0	0	15	0	163			1864-5631			WOS:000313702200022	23255471

The electrodeposition (ED) conditions, i.e., applied current density and total cycle number, and ED solutions with different precursor ratios of ruthenium to iridium are examined to fabricate various DSAs with a uniform thickness, and the effect of the iridium content on the catalytic activity is investigated. Among various DSA electrodes, the DSA electrode without iridium exhibits the highest activity and stability in the acidic medium owing to the high ratio of ruthenium. Conversely, the DSA electrode obtained using the ED solution with the ratio of 8:2 exhibits the highest performance in the alkaline medium. This is because the DSA electrode without iridium showed low stability, which is attributed to the dissolution of ruthenium oxide in the alkaline medium. In addition, two large-scale DSA electrodes optimized in the acidic and alkaline electrolytes show excellent performance, indicating the feasibility of the application of this electrode in practical electrolysis.

However, significant challenge and gap remains for the design and fabrication of highly efficient, robust yet cost-effective multifunctional catalyst. One of the fundamentals of the effective catalysts lies in the effective active sites capable of lowering the adsorption energy required for the intermediate steps. In this work, for the first time, two-dimensional (2D) NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoswards is reported by chemical scission of NiFe layered double hydroxide nanosheets with silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4). Si is incorporated into the structure of NiFe-LDH nanoswords with the emergence of new bond of Si-O-M. In situ Raman together with theoretical calculation confirmed that Tailored-NiFe-LDH has a more active internal structure than NiFe-LDH nanosheet, favoring the formation of active intermediates. The new Si-O-M bond lowers the energy required for the adsorption process. Tailored-NiFe-LDH shows low eta(10) of 280 mV and Tafel slope of 52.11 mV dec(-1) at 10 mA cm(-2) (Oxygen evolution reaction). When used as water splitting catalyst in a full cell, Tailored-NiFe-LDH shows good activity and stability. We believe this simple and rapid synthesis route is proposed to prepare novel catalysts with good electrical conductivity, and opens new strategy to tailor 2D LDH materials and other similar hydroxyl-rich superstructures and composites.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000870015700001

However, its stability at large current density is still a major hurdle to satisfy practical requirements for electrocatalytic Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we successfully anchored Pt single atoms (Pt SAs) in the oxygen vacancies (O-vac) of Molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) as advanced HER electrocatalyst. Experimental and theoretical calculations results reveal that the O-va(c) can not only stabilize Pt SAs, but also modulate the electronic structure of the active site, enabling Pt SAs/MoO2 to exhibit superior HER activity in a wide pH electrolyte at large current density. Especially, the 1.1 wt% Pt SAs/MoO2 deliver ultralow overpotentials (9.3, 14, and 16 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and small Tafel slopes (28.78, 36.86, and 65.18 mV dec(-1)) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. Moreover, it displays significantly enhanced mass activity of up to 28, 32, and 56 times compared to the benchmark 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst, and outstanding long-term durability (similar to 200 h) at large current density of -1000 mA cm(-2). The significantly improved HER performances are mainly ascribed to the synergistic catalytic effects of between Pt SAs and O-va(c) in MoO2. These impressive findings can provide insights into the rational design of electrocatalysts that used for future clean energy utilization.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724712100004

Here, we report the synthesis of Ir nanocrystals, in the form of Pd@Ir core-shell structures and with well-defined high-index {331} facets, by a robust seed-mediated process. The success relies on the precise control over the deposition of ultrathin Ir layer on Pd trioctahedral nanocrystals. The Pd@Ir nanocatalyst with such unique high-index facets delivers substantially promoted OER activity and durability compared with those with low-index facets (i.e., {100} and {111} facets), with an overpotential as low as 300 mV, boosted mass activities up to 1.01 A mg(Ir)(-1) at 1.53 V, and a minimal Tafel slope of 84.9 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the superior OER performance originates from the easier hydroxylation of *O to *OOH over high-index facets, along with the appropriate value of Delta G(O)-Delta G(OH) and satisfactory adsorption/desorption property. Moreover, the high-index facets are apt to be electrochemically oxidized into stable IrOx species, leading to an improved durability. Both theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the fascinating property of a high-index Ir shell in facilitating OER activity and durability.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2155-5435			WOS:000670659900052

For this purpose, we here synthesize a stacked nanofilm (G-BNG) of pure graphene (G) on boron and nitrogen (BN)-codoped graphene (BNG) with a total thickness of about 2-3 nm and 87% transparency at 550 nm that shows an efficient OER performance, better than that of a stacked G-G layer, G-BG film, or G-NG film in an alkaline electrolyte. The G-BNG film performs OER with the highest reaction kinetics (lowest Tafel slope similar to 143.22 mV/dec) and a small overpotential (0.58 V) along with 81.6% retention of the current density at 1.8 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) even after 50000 s of operation. Experimental analysis reveals that the doped B and N atoms in the bottom layer influence the p-bonding environment in the top G layer, facilitating the effective electron/charge transfer for OER electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the demonstrated OER performance is comparable or even superior to that of other reported C-based electrocatalysts with at least 400-700 times lower catalyst loading, making the G-BNG film promising for advanced renewable energy conversion systems, such as various kinds of transparent air batteries and water electrolyzers.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2574-0970			WOS:000583331600045

Low-cost, nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that can withstand high operational current densities will likely be the best candidates for meeting the commercial needs for a range of OER applications. In addition to electrode composition, the surface morphology of gas evolving electrodes can affect their efficiency and performance. In this work, we demonstrate the influence of electrochemical aging on the performance of micro- and nanoscale textures for the OER A series of textured Ni electrodes were prepared by rapid, scalable techniques, which included the use of bead-blasting. Two distinct approaches to induce the formation of the active Ni (oxy)hydroxide phase were conducted by electrochemical aging using cyclic voltammetry (CV) methods. The influence of the aging technique was assessed and correlated to the performance of these surface textures. Differences in the morphology of these textures and their resulting surface areas were estimated using three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions obtained from electron microscopy analyses. Focused ion beam (FIB) milling was also performed on the bead-blasted electrodes to visualize buried cracks and voids. The potential required for the OER at an applied current density of 500 mA/cm(2) exhibited a reduction of 0.7 V for the electrodes aged by the steady-state treatment. The OER performance of the textured electrodes was found to correlate to both the electrode surface morphology and the type of electrochemical aging applied to the electrodes.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000469885300024

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that Fe-doped nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH) is one of the most active OER catalysts in alkaline media. Despite extensive research, however, many unanswered questions pertaining to the OER mechanism on this material remain. Here, using density functional theory + U calculations, we compare several surfaces of beta-NiOOH studied for the OER and determine that unlike some earlier models selected, the (001) surface is the most stable surface under electrochemical conditions. We then examine several magnetic states of this material and predict that, unlike bulk beta-NiOOH, (001)-beta-NiOOH manifests a slight preference to be ferromagnetic. We then use the resulting structural model to compare in detail four commonly proposed OER mechanisms. In addition to excluding a proposed mechanism involving hydrogen peroxide formation, we identify multiple binuclear mechanisms with slightly lower overpotentials than the commonly studied associative mechanism. All exhibit overpotentials that coincide well with measured values. However, the similarity in calculated overpotentials highlights the fact that several mechanisms are likely to be operative under electrochemical conditions on beta-NiOOH. This finding suggests that much of the complexity of studying the OER on NiOOH is due to multiple competing mechanisms occurring under given conditions, which should be accounted for in subsequent analyses.									87	0	0	0	4	0	87			2155-5435			WOS:000407309100047

Here, by rationally adding an appropriate amount of Mn into the lattice of a layered NaxCoO2 parent oxide, high solubility of iron into the NaxCoO2 oxide lattice is realized without the use of an extremely air-sensitive Na2O2 raw material, and the synergy created between the Co and Fe can boost the catalytic activity of the layered oxide for OER. Moreover, the water intercalation capability of the layered oxides can be utilized to make the oxide resemble mixed metal hydroxides, which will also bring a beneficial effect for OER As a result, the as-developed Na0.67Mn0.5CoO3Fe0.2O2 (CF-32) layered oxide with an optimal Co/Fe ratio and water intercalation shows high OER performance in alkaline media, overperforming the benchmark IrO2 catalyst. In 0.1 M KOH solution, the novel catalyst shows 0.39 V overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) and favorable stability. The excellent OER performance of CF-32 is due to the synergistic effect of transition-metal elements (Co and Fe) and water intercalation, leading to little charge transfer resistance, large amounts of exposed catalytic active sites, plenty of surface high oxidation state O-2(2-)/O- oxygen species, and hydroxide-rich surface. The facile synthesis and high OER performance of CF-32 enriches the non-noble metal family of OER catalysts and boosts the practical application of non-noble metal catalysts.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000476684900042	31264838

The catalysts were prepared by a photodeposition method and deposited on conductive glass substrates, and measurements were performed under defined mass transport conditions in a photoelectrochemical thin-layer flow cell. The role of Au nanopartides as cocatalysts in these reactions was explored by varying the Au loading and the light intensity, respectively. On the basis of these data, it is demonstrated that the Au nanopartides affect the above reactions in different ways, by (i) catalyzing the recombination of photogenerated holes and electrons as well as parasitic side reactions (O-2 reduction) in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction, by (ii) affecting the selectivity in that reaction, and by (iii) improving the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes by catalyzing the reaction with sacrificial agents such as methanol, thus enhancing the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction.									56	2	0	0	5	1	55			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000364435200008

To fully exploit their potential as efficient OER catalysts, we developed a fast one-step strategy to engineer a unique nanostructure for the benchmark catalyst IrO2 utilizing an ultra-fast pulse laser, through which a shell of ultra-small Ir spheres with a diameter of ca. 2 nm is in situ engineered around the IrO2 core. The creation of the Ir sphere shell not only increases the electrochemical surface area, but also improves the electrical conductivity of the electrocatalyst. The as-engineered IrO2@Ir architecture exhibits extremely high electrocatalytic activity towards the OER, revealing an overpotential of 255 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 45 mV dec(-1). These values are much lower than those observed for the unmodified structure. Furthermore, the catalytic performance is the best among all the noble metal-based OER catalysts. This work may open a new avenue to efficiently improve the catalytic activity of noble metal-based catalysts and significantly advance the development in the energy industry.									84	7	0	0	4	0	85			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465410200025	30801572

The fabricated heterostructure electrodes are optimized to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. The deposited films exhibit a mixture of nanosheet and nanoflake morphologies. Raman spectra reveal improvements in various disorder-related modes in the hybrid NCs due to the nanometer scale and the transformation of graphite-stacked layers into thin graphene nanosheets.

First, the unique NiSe/NF nanopillar arrays were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as a precursor template that can provide a large surface area, excellent conductivity, and robust support. Next, amorphous NiOOH covering the surface of NiSe nanopillars was fabricated by ISEO, as confirmed by XPS andEDX spectroscopy. SEM images revealed the hyacinth-like morphology of NiSe@NiOOH/NF with NiOOH as the shell and NiSe as the core. The electrochemical performance of NiSe@NiOOH/NF for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was investigated. NiSe@NiOOH/NF demonstrates an obviously enhanced OER activity with much lower overpotential of 332 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) compared to other Ni-based electrocatalysts. The low charge-transfer resistance (R-ct), large electrochemical double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs), and excellent long-term stability of NiSe@NiOOH/NF confirm the enhancement of its electrochemical performance for the OER, which can be ascribed to the large amount of active sites derived from the amorphous NiOOH shell and the good conductivity and stability derived from the NiSe core. In addition, the synergistic effect between the NiSe core and NiOOH shell could serve for a highly efficient OER electrocatalyst.									187	7	0	0	6	0	189			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000381331600026	27439758

However, the lack of selective and Earth-abundant catalysts able to achieve the desired transformation reactions in an aqueous matrix presents a substantial impediment as of today. Here we introduce atomic layer deposition of SnO2 on CuO nanowires as a means for changing the wide product distribution of CuO-derived CO2 reduction electrocatalysts to yield predominantly CO. The activity of this catalyst towards oxygen evolution enables us to use it both as the cathode and anode for complete CO2 electrolysis. In the resulting device, the electrodes are separated by a bipolar membrane, allowing each half-reaction to run in its optimal electrolyte environment. Using a GaInP/GaInAs/Ge photovoltaic we achieve the solar-driven splitting of CO2 into CO and oxygen with a bifunctional, sustainable and all Earth-abundant system at an efficiency of 13.4%.									345	24	0	0	33	1	351			2058-7546			WOS:000406499200007

With illumination in a discharge process, photoelectrons generated in the conduction band (CB) of C3N4 are donated to O-2 for O-2(-), which undergoes a second electron reduction to O-2(2-) and gives the final product of Li2O2; in a reverse process, holes left behind in the valence band (VB) of C3N4 plus an applied lower voltage than the equilibrium drive the Li2O2 oxidation. The discharge voltage is significantly increased to 3.22 V, surpassing the thermodynamic limit of 2.96 V, and the charge voltage is reduced to 3.38 V. This leads to a record-high round-trip efficiency of 95.3 % and energy density increase of 23.0 % compared to that in the dark.									71	2	0	0	5	0	71			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000494501100001	31591805

Here, an efficient catalyst of N-doped carbon with non-precious metals (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) designated as MFCN/NC has been prepared by using a simple pyrolysis method. Pyridinic nitrogen, graphitic carbon, MnO, and Fe-Co-Ni nanoparticles, which are efficient for catalyzing the ORR individually or synergistically, are successfully introduced into the composite catalyst. The optimized MFCN/NC catalyst exhibits four-electron reduction of O-2 with a more positive ORR onset potential (54mV) and a more positive half-wave potential (46mV) than commercial Pt/C. Moreover, MFCN/NC shows remarkable electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability in Na2CO3 electrolysis. The cell voltages at 10 and 100mAcm(-2) are only 0.86 and 1.45V, respectively, suggesting an energy-saving electrolysis of Na2CO3 to regenerate NaHCO3 and NaOH.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-0216			WOS:000368364700030

In this work, NiFeOx clusters strongly coupled N-doped carbon (NiFeOx (c) NC) hybrid is prepared by a one-step electrodeposition process in an aqueous solution containing Ni2+, Fe3+, and carbon quantum dots. The highly coupled interface between the sub-nano NiFeOx clusters and N-doped carbon results in the enhanced OER performance superior to the commercial dimensionally stable anode (RuIr-based), as evidenced by its lower overpotential (195 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and faster kinetics (Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1)), along with the excellent long-term durability, rate capability and environmental adaptability. It is believed that the NiFeOx (c) NC hybrid and electrodeposition-electrocatalysis strategy developed in this work provide new possibilities for the development of clean electrochemical technology.									32	2	0	0	1	0	33			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300007

We chose epitaxial (100)-oriented La0.6Sr0.4Mn1-delta O3 (LSMO) thin films as a model system with high electrochemical activity comparable to (110)- oriented IrO2 to investigate the effect of Mn off-stoichiometry on both catalytic activity and stability. Extensive structural characterization was performed by microscopic and spectroscopic methods before and after electrochemical characterization using rotating ring-disk studies. Stoichiometric LSMO had the highest activity, while both Mn deficiency and excess reduced the catalytic activity. Furthermore, all samples preserved the crystal structure up to the very surface. Mn excess improved the long-term activity, and we hypothesize that excess Mn stabilizes the surface chemistry during catalysis. Our data show that the defect chemistry should be considered when designing catalysts with enhanced activity and rugged stability.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2073-4344			WOS:000404099100014

Herein we report a novel TiN nanorod array-based cathode, which was firstly prepared by growing a TiN nanorod array on carbon paper (CP), and then followed by depositing MnO2 ultrathin sheets or Ir nanoparticles on the TiN nanorods to form well-ordered, three-dimensional (3D), and free-standing structured cathodes: TiN@ MnO2/CP and TiN@ Ir/CP. Both cathodes exhibited good specific capacity and excellent cycling stability. Their specific discharge capacities were up to 2637 and 2530 mA h g(-1), respectively. After 200 cycles for 2000 h at a current density of 100 mA g(-1), no obvious decays were observed for TiN@ MnO2/CP and TiN@ Ir/CP cathodes, while significant decreases were observed after the 80th and 30th cycles for the Pt/C and TiN/CP cathodes, respectively. Such high performance can be ascribed to the 3D array structure with enough microspace and high surface area, which facilitated the high dispersion of active components and prevented the formation of large/irreversible Li2O2.									41	6	0	0	2	0	41			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000424694400036	29372212

In this work, three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanotube (CNT) microsphere prepared by spray pyrolysis are used as conductive carbon framework. MnO2 and Fe2O3 nanorods are uniformly deposited on rationally designed CNT microsphere via a two-step bottom-up processing; through the formation of 3D porous architecture, electron transfer and mass transport can be facilitated. Due to the synergetic effect of uniformly deposited MnO2 and Fe2O3 nanorods and 3D porous architecture of CNT framework, MnO2-Fe2O3/CNT exhibited superior oxygen reduction/evolution catalytic activities under alkaline media comparing to Pt/C-RuO2. Moreover, as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for ZABs, MnO2-Fe2O3/CNT delivered high power density of 253 mW cm-2, specific capacity of 802 mA h g-1, and low polarization potential difference, as well as long-term cycling stability up to 3600 min.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000641316100006

The chemical reaction scheme involves 237 reactions between 31 species containing hydrogen, helium, carbon, oxygen, and iron. The abundances were computed for typical conditions of formation and disintegration of dense molecular clouds. Abundances of carbon-containing molecules in dense dark clouds grow only over 105-106 years and diminish thereafter, The intense UV radiation which attends the destruction of molecular clouds (upto 106 years) provides favorable conditions for effective formation of CH, CH+, and other hydrocarbon molecules. The evolution of molecular abundances unto 107 years depends on initial conditions in the medium and may be an indicator of the age and history of the interstellar cloud.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0884-5913			INSPEC:5135563

The transformation of the current fossil-fuel-based energy system to a more sustainable, renewable and cleaner alternative is desperately required to mitigate climate change. As a carbon-free and clean energy carrier, hydrogen has long been considered as a promising energy option. However, hydrogen does not exist naturally due to its inherently reactive features and has to be cost-effectively produced from hydrogen-containing compounds. Solar or electrochemically driven water splitting is an appealing vision for future sustainable hydrogen production. The state of the art water splitting technology via electro-catalysis is highly dependent on the efficiency of electrocatalysts to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a possible limiting step for the overall reaction. Electro-catalysts are currently dominated by these noble metals. To minimize the production cost, it is vital to develop noble-metal free catalysts for water splitting. In this context, metal nitrides have captured the imagination of academic researchers. This review summarizes the recent research progress made in these nanostructured metal nitrides as efficient and cheap catalysts for electrochemical and photo(electro)chemical water splitting. The various synthetic strategies for the fabrication and functionalization of these nanostructured metal nitrides are first presented followed by the introduction of their unique physical, chemical, and electronic properties and their respective applications in facilitating the HER, OER and the overall water splitting reaction. Some engineering perspectives to further enhance the performances of these nanostructured catalysts for water splitting are also discussed. Finally, opportunities for future development are briefly proposed.									263	9	0	0	20	0	265			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000448412700002

PsbY, a small membrane-spanning polypeptide, has recently been suggested to provide a ligand for manganese in PSII (A.E. Gau, H.H. Thole, A. Sokolenko, L. Altschmied, R.G. Herrmann, E.K. Pistorius [1998] Mol Gen Genet 260: 56-68). We have constructed a mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with an inactivated psbY gene (sml0007). Southern-blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the mutant had completely segregated. However, the Delta psbY mutant cells grew normally under photoautotrophic conditions. Moreover, growth of the wild-type and mutant cells were similar under highlight photoinhibition conditions, as well as in media without any added manganese, calcium, or chloride, three required inorganic cofactors for the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII. Analysis of steady-state and flash-induced oxygen evolution, fluorescence induction, and decay kinetics, and thermoluminescence profiles demonstrated that the Delta psbY mutant cells have normal photosynthetic activities. We conclude that the PsbY protein in Synechocystis 6803 is not essential for oxygenic photosynthesis and does not provide an important binding site for manganese in the oxygen-evolving complex of PSII.									32	2	0	0	30	0	32			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000084282000020	10594113

It is well-known that transition metal carbides (TMCs) have Pt-like electronic structures and catalytic behaviors. However, monometallic carbides in acidic medium show ignored OER activities. Herein, we reported that the catalytic activity of the TMCs can be enhanced by constructing bimetallic carbides (TiTaC2) fabricated through hydrothermal treatment followed by an annealing process, and further by doping fluorine (F) into the bimetallic carbides (TiTaFxC2). The as-prepared reduced graphene oxide (rGO) supported TiTaFxC2 nanoparticles (TiTaFxC2 NP/rGO) show state-of-the-art OER catalytic activity, which is even superior to Ir/C catalyst (an onset potential of only 1.42 V vs RHE and the overpotential of 490 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2)), fast kinetics (Tafel slope of only 36 mV dec(-1)), and high durability (maintaining the current density at 1.60 V vs RHE for 40 h). Detailed structural characterizations together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electronic structures of the bimetallic carbides have been tuned, and their possible mechanism is also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000849769700001	35997614

However, efficient SO2OR catalysts are still limited to Pt and Au. Here, we report an efficient partially oxidized Ni@C (po-Ni@C) SO2OR catalyst, which exhibits better performance than the 20% Pt/C catalyst. Also, utilizing the po-Ni@C catalyst mediated SO2OR to replace the Ti/IrO2-Ta2O5 catalyzed OER can vastly alleviate the electro-consumption in the hydrogen electro-production. Furthermore, a solar to hydrogen electrolyzer was established and delivered similar to 25 mA current powered by a 1 V commercial silicon solar cell. This work may provide a new strategy for the design of SO2OR catalysts and establish waste SO2 treatment and H-2 electro-production systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000664223600001

However, the easy agglomeration of lamellar LDHs in the aqueous phase limits their practical applications. Herein, a series of ternary NiCoFe LDHs were successfully fabricated on nickel foam (NF) via a simple electrodeposition method. The as-prepared Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF displayed an unique nanoarray structural feature. It showed an OER overpotential of 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline solution, which was superior to most systems reported so far. As evidenced by the XPS and XAFS results, such excellent performance of Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF was attributed to the higher Co3+/Co2+ ratio and more defects exposed, comparing with Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)-bulk and Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)-mono LDHs prepared by conventional coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the ratio of Co to Fe could significantly tune the Co electronic structure of Ni(CoxFe1-x)/NF composites (x=0.25, 0.50 and 0.75) and affect the electrocatalytic activity for OER, in which Ni(Co0.5Fe0.5)/NF showed the lowest energy barrier for OER rate-determining step (from O* to OOH*). This work proposes a facile method to develop high-efficiency OER electrocatalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000734998300001	34873760

Herein, unusual 3D hierarchical MnCo2O4 porous dumbbells have been synthesized by a facile solvothermal method combined with a following heat treatment in air. The as-obtained MnCo2O4 dumbbells are composed of tightly stacked nanorods and show a large specific surface area of 41.30 m(2) g(-1) with a pore size distribution of 2-10 nm. As an anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), the MnCo2O4 dumbbell electrode exhibits high reversible capacity and good rate capability, where a stable reversible capacity of 955 mA h g(-1) can be maintained after 180 cycles at 200 mA g(-1). Even at a high current density of 2000 mA g(-1), the electrode can still deliver a specific capacity of 423.3 mA h g(-1), demonstrating superior electrochemical properties for LIBs. In addition, the obtained 3D hierarchical MnCo2O4 porous dumbbells also display good oxygen evolution reaction activity with an overpotential of 426 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 93 mV dec(-1).									61	5	0	0	3	0	61			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000427910800038	29465224

Because of the capital-intensive features and the low efficiencies of experimental research approaches, modeling and simulation have become a promising way to study the electrowinning processes. The coupling of gas-liquid two-phase flow from gas evolution with the electrochemistry process, however, is challenging to simulate. In this paper, an approach of building a comprehensive Zn electrowinning model based on COMSOL Multiphysics was introduced. Further, the basic model results in velocity field, concentration distribution, gas fractions, and current efficiency were demonstrated and discussed.

Herein, amorphous bimetallic nickel-iron phosphide hierarchical nanostructures enrooted on nickel-iron alloy foam (NiFeP/NFF) are facilely fabricated via direct phosphidation of NFF at low temperature and developed as an efficient self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst to catalyze both the OER and HER with high activity, fast kinetics and excellent stability. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer simultaneously utilizing NiFeP/NFF as the cathode and anode only needs a cell voltage of 1.58 V to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), overpassing most of the reported bifunctional electrocatalysts and comparable to noble metal-based ones. Impressively, the NiFeP/NFF-based symmetric electrolyzer can work well without appreciable performance degradation at a high current density of 500 mA cm(-2) for over 1000 h for continuous hydrogen production with 100% faradaic efficiency, showing superb durability and great promise for industrial application.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000652677700001	34019054

Herein, based on V-doped nickel sulfide nanowire on nickel foam (NiVS/NF), we further conduct controllable electrodeposition of Fe hydroxides film on NiVS/NF (eFe/NiVS/NF) to further improve OER performance and stability. For comparison, ultrafast chemical deposition of Fe hydroxides on NiVS/NF (uFe/NiVS/NF) is also utilized. V-doping of NiVS/NF may introduce more active sites for OER, and nanowire structure can expose abundant active sites and facilitate mass transport. Both of the two depositions generate amorphous Fe hydroxides film covering on the surface of nanowires and lead to enhanced OER activities. Furthermore, electrodeposition strategy realizes uniform Fe hydroxides film on eFe/NiVS/NF confirmed by superior OER activity of eFe/NiVS/NF than uFe/NiVS/NF with relatively enhanced stability. The OER activity of eFe/NiVS/NF depends on various electrodepositon time, and the optimal time (15 s) is obtained with maximum OER activity. Therefore, the controllable electrodeposition of Fe may provide an efficient and simple strategy to enhance the OER properties of electrocatalysts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a newly designed antiperovskite-based hybrid composed of a conductive InNNi3 core and amorphous InNi(oxy)hydroxide shell is first reported as promising OER/HER bifunctional electrocatalyst. Prepared by a facile electrochemical oxidation strategy, such unique hybrid (denoted as EO-InNNi3) exhibits excellent OER and HER activities in alkaline media, benefiting from the inherent high-efficiency HER catalytic nature of InNNi3 antiperovskite and the promoting role of OER-active InNi(oxy)hydroxide thin film, which is confirmed by theoretical simulations and in situ Raman studies. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer integrated EO-InNNi3 as both anode and cathode delivers a low voltage of 1.64 V at 10 mA cm(-2), while maintaining excellent durability. This work demonstrates the application of antiperovskite-based materials in the field of overall water splitting and inspires insights into the development of advanced catalysts for various energy applications.									18	1	0	0	0	0	17			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000594734400001	33251694

La1-xSrxFeO3-delta has shown promise for use as an OSM in methane reforming reactions due to its high product selectivity, fast oxide diffusion, and cycle stability. Here, we investigate the structural evolution of the series La1-xSrxFeO3-delta for x = 0, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 1, using in situ synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, as it is cycled under the conditions of a chemical looping reactor (methane and oxygen atmospheres). In the compositions x = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, and 1, we discover an "envelope", or temperature range, of oxygen storage capacity (OSC), where oxygen can easily and reversibly be inserted and removed from the OSM. Our in situ X-ray and neutron diffraction results reveal that while samples with higher Sr contents had a higher OSC, those same samples suffered from slower reaction kinetics and some, such as the x = 1/2 and x = 2/3 compositions, had local variations in Sr content, which led to inhomogeneous regions with varying reaction rates. Therefore, we highlight the importance of in situ diffraction studies, and we propose that these measurements are required for the thorough evaluation of future candidate OSMs. We recommend La2/3Sr1/3FeO3-delta as the optimal OSM in the series because its structure remains homogeneous throughout the reaction, and its OSC "envelope" is similar to that of the higher doped materials.									49	1	0	0	0	0	49			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000378016400048

However, the realization and scalability of this technology requires efficient electrocatalysts to promote cathodic hydrogen evolution and anodic oxygen evolution. The rapid evolution of the metal/covalent-organic frameworks (MOFs/COFs) family provides new opportunities for the development of water splitting. This review summarizes recent advances of MOF- and COF-based electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and highlights the advantages of these electrocatalysts over those conventionally used. Particular attentions are paid to the design principles, construction strategies, and structure-property relationships for MOF/COF-based electrocatalysts. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives of MOF/COF-based electrocatalysts for water splitting are also presented. We hope this review will provide a timely reference for advancing MOF/COF-based electrode materials towards practicable water splitting and useful insights for future energy technologies beyond water electrolysis.									184	12	0	0	13	0	185			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000443272700001

The electrodeposited nickel film induces the NiFe LDH nanosheets grow vertically and thinly. As well, the nickel abundant interfaces and inner space makes this catalyst effective for OER. It was further served as the OER electrode in a water splitting system coupled the Pt/C cathode, and a cell voltage was at 1.52 and 1.67 V to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2). In addition, the water electrolyzer can suffer a long time of 24 h at 50 mA cm(-2), showing the feasibility in a practical unbiased alkaline water splitting system.

The mutual effect between proximate Ni and Fe atoms is essential in regulating the electronic structure of the active site to boost the OER kinetics. Detailed studies confirm that the separated monometal phases in NiFe-based materials are detrimental to OER. Thus, the high-level blending of Ni and Fe in NiFe-based OER electrocatalysts is critical. Herein, an NiFe oxalate nanomesh array based on solid solutions between nickel (II) oxalate and iron (II) oxalate is prepared through a facile surfactant-free approach in the presence of the reductive oxalate anions. The integrated electrode can efficiently catalyze water oxidation to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) with a small overpotential of 203 mV in a 1.0 m KOH aqueous solution. The high efficiency can be attributed to the atomic level mix of Ni and Fe in the solid solutions and the hierarchical porous structure of the nanomesh array. These two aspects bring about fast kinetics, efficient mass diffusion, and quick charge transfer, which are the three major positive factors for a high-performance heterogenous electrocatalyst.									37	3	0	0	1	0	37			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000489428800001	31588672

Different alloys were prepared by rapid solidification and subsequent high-energy milling. Regarding OER activity, the best efficiency was obtained for a nanocrystalline Ni-Fe alloy in 29.9 wt.% KOH at 298 K. However, at elevated temperature (333 K), comparable activities were determined in short-term experiments for nanocrystalline Ni-Fe and Ni alloys as well as for polycrystalline Ni. This initially incomprehensible outcome can be explained by the incorporation of Fe, which is present as impurity in the reagent grade KOH solution, into the NiOOH anode surface layer. However, after a long-term operation, the nanocrystalline Ni-Fe alloy shows a significantly better activity, in particular, at altering current density of up to 1 A cm(-2). As a result, the nanocrystalline Ni-Fe alloy exhibits a very high efficiency and excellent long-term activity (375 mV overpotential at 0.3 A cm(-2)) after 95 h of operation at different loads.

Several activation or functionalization methods are usually used to improve physicochemical and functional properties of BCHs. In the context of green and sustainable future development, activated and functionalized biochars with abundant surface functional groups and large surface area can act as effective catalysts or catalyst supports for chemical transformation of a range of bioproducts in biorefineries. Above the well-known BCH applications, their use as adsorbents to remove pollutants are the mostly discussed, although their potential as catalysts or catalyst supports for advanced (electro)catalytic processes has not been comprehensively explored. In this review, the production/activation/functionalization of metal-supported biochar (M-BCH) are scrutinized, giving special emphasis to the metal-functionalized biochar-based (electro)catalysts as promising catalysts for bioenergy and bioproducts production. Their performance in the fields of biorefinery processes, and energy storage and conversion as electrode materials for oxygen and hydrogen evolutions, oxygen reduction, and supercapacitors, are also reviewed and discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000763915700001

The 3DPNN was prepared with a novel leaven dough method and served as both the nickel source for growth of the mixed NiO/NiCo2O4 nanocrystals and the charge transport highway to accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the OER The mixed NiO/NiCo2O4 nanocrystals exhibited pronounced synergistic effects to achieve a high mass activity of 200 A g(-1) at the catalyst mass loading of 0.5 mg cm(-2), largely outperforming the corresponding single component nanocrystal systems, NiO (5.87) and NiCo2O4 (9.35). The NiO/NiCo2O4@3DPNN composite electrocatalyst achieved a low overpotential of 264 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 389 mV at the practically high current density of 250 mA cm(-2), which compete favorably among the top tier of previously reported OER electrocatalysts. Moreover, it exhibited good stability even at the high current density of 250 mA cm(-2), showing only 9.40% increase in working applied potential after a continuous 12 h operation. The present work demonstrates a new design for highly efficient OER catalysts with in situ growth of mixed oxide nanocrystals of pronounced synergistic effects.									64	4	0	0	2	0	66			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000422814400046	29220158

However, the overall efficiency (i.e. voltage and/or energy efficiency) and power performance of SWBs are limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the current collector of the SWB cathode. Generally, the charge storage and delivery process through the electric double layer (EDL) are much faster compared to OER/ORR and other Faradic reactions. To improve the performance of SWBs, we utilized the benefit of EDL formation along with OER/ORR activities using commercial high surface area (similar to 2038 m(2) g(-1)) and hydrophilic activated carbon cloth (ACC) as a current collector at the cathode. As anticipated, the SWB with ACC showed a reduced voltage gap (0.49 V), high energy efficiency (86%), improved rate capability, and improved power performance (16.2 mW cm(-2)) compared to those of the SWB operated with lower surface area carbon felt (2.2 m(2) g(-1), 1.24 V, 71%, and 5.5 mW cm(-2), respectively). These findings suggest that hybridization of the EDL and OER/ORR processes on the cathode side of SWB can improve overall performance.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000517663800046

Non-stoichiometric M0.85Se (M = Ni or Co) nanoparticles are synthesized and modified on nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere (NHCS). The NHCS loaded Ni0.85Se (Ni0.85Se-NHCS) with rich Ni3+ presents higher OER activity, whereas the NHCS-loaded Co0.85Se (Co0.85Se-NHCS) with abundant Co2+ displays better ORR activity, respectively. When Co0.85Se-NHCS is mixed with Ni0.85Se-NHCS in a mass ratio of 1 : 1, the resulting mixture (Ni0.85Se/Co0.85Se-NHCS-2) shows better ORR and OER dual catalytic functions than a single selenide. Moreover, zinc-air batteries equipped with Ni0.85Se/Co0.85Se-NHCS-2 as the oxygen electrode catalyst exhibit excellent charge and discharge performance as well as improved stability over precious metals. This work has developed a simple and effective method to prepare excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, which is beneficial for the practical large-scale application of zinc-air batteries.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2046-2069		WOS:000660243300007	35479235

Two different configurations for a tri-electrode battery have been developed in this work; i.e., a planar cell and a sandwich cell. Discharge-recharge cycling tests at 5 mA cm(-2) show that the sandwich cell is more suitable for ZABs than the planar cell. Various additives for the GPEs, such as cross linking agents and ZnO, have also been evaluated using the tri-electrode design. Cross linking density affects the physical state of GPEs, which in turn affects the oxygen evolution reaction as there is an adverse effect of excessive GPE/Ni foam electrode contact area because oxygen bubbles may be trapped in the GPE. The addition of ZnO to the oxygen reduction reaction side of the battery enhances the cycling performance of ZABs; i.e., the battery can withstand at least 100 cycles at 5 mA cm(-2) with an efficiency of 62% during the first cycle.

Recently, the nickel utilization has also come under interest in the latest prices soar of nickel. Herein, 41 kinds of Ni-M (oxy)hydroxides (M = Fe, Cu, Co and Cr) are pre-pared via a quick electrodeposition method to screen Ni-M (oxy)hydroxides. It is observed that OER activity and durability of Ni-M (oxy)hydroxides heavily depend on the content of M, and the Fe plays the best role on OER activity enhancement. The optimum Ni8Fe2/ Ni(OH)2/FeOOH (NiFe-8) exhibit a low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope of 83 mV dec-1, which are lower than those of other Ni-M (oxy) hydroxides. In addition, the designed NiFe-8 shows superior cycling stability (10,000 times), self-adapting function during 33.01-49.65 h resulting in a 55.56 h long-term operation durability with 15.94 mA cm-2 ending activity. Such performance together with low preparation cost, Ni-based materials are favorable for enterprises to improve their eco-nomic benefit as well as open up an opportunity for mass-producing of them.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Simultaneous modulation of geometric and electronic structure is a promising strategy for boosting the electrocatalytic active of OER catalysts. Herein, a novel type of Mn doped Co9S8 supported on N-enriched porous carbon polyhedron composite material (Mn-Co9S8/NC) is constructed via absorption-pyrolysis-sulfurization treatment of Zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-67). ZIF-67 derived N-enriched porous carbon polyhedron serves as the porous skeleton for anchoring numerous Co9S8 nanoparticles. The results confirm that the incorporation of Mn in Co9S8/NC can improve the degree of graphitization compared with Co9S8/NC, implying the enhancement of the conductivity. Meanwhile, the incorporation of Mn can lead to electronic modulation of Co species to bump up the intrinsic activity of active site in Mn-Co9S8/NC. Due to the synergistic effect of Mn, Co9S8 and porous carbon structure, the specific surface area and electronic structure are optimized, endowing the maximum utilization of active sites. The Mn-Co9S8/NC electrocatalyst exhibits superior OER activity with the overpotential of 286 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. This work provides prospective insights into the synergistic coupling of geometric and electronic structure of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) material for efficient electrocatalysts.

In this work, the uniform ZIF-67 rhombic dodecahedron penetrated CoMn-LDH nanoneedle arrays were firstly synthesized and then transformed into shish-kebab type MnCo2O4@Co3O4 nanoneedle arrays by thermal annealing in air. The resulting nanoneedle arrays exhibit high specific capacitance (1440C cm(-2) at 1.0 mA cm(-2)) and excellent cycling stability while evaluated as promising electrodes for battery-type supercapacitor. An assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device using MnCo2O4@Co3O4 as positive electrode and activated carbon (AC) as negative electrode also exhibits a high energy density of 31 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 208.5 W kg(-1), furthermore, still remains 14.6 Wh kg(-1) even at a higher power density of 3326.6 W kg(-1). Importantly, a red light-emitting diode (LED) can be illuminated about 6 min, indicating a great potential for practical applications of the ASC. Besides, the MnCo2O4@Co3O4 exhibits much better electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, this work demonstrates a feasible strategy for the design and fabrication of 1D shish-kebab type nanoneedle arrays with multiple functions.									151	3	0	0	11	0	153			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000445413900085

In this work, a novel template-engaged strategy followed by sequential etching and phosphorization treatments is demonstrated to fabricate open and hierarchical Ni-Co-P hollow nanobricks (HNBs) via the assembly of oriented 2D nanosheets. Benefiting from the unique nano-architectures with large electrolyte-accessible surface and abundant mass diffusion pathways, the as-prepared Ni-Co-P HNBs exhibit high electrocatalytic activity, which affords the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 270 mV and 107 mV for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions respectively, and excellent stability in an alkaline medium. Remarkably, when used as both the anode and cathode, a low cell voltage of 1.62 V is required to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), making the Ni-Co-P HNBs an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.									602	32	0	0	23	0	608			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000430537000012

In relevance to water electrolysis, the oxygen coupling reaction on Pt metal surfaces is systematically investigated in this work by combining periodic density functional theory calculations with a new theoretical approach to mimic the electrochemical environment. In our approach, the surface is explicitly polarized by adding/subtracting charges and the counter charges are placed as Gaussian-distributed plane charges in a vacuum. With this method, the surface phase diagrams for both the closed-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) are determined, which demonstrates that stepped surface sites can better accumulate oxidative species and thus reach to a higher local O coverage compared to Pt(111) at a given potential. The water environment is proved to affect the phase diagram marginally. By fully exploring the possible oxygen coupling channels on Pt surfaces, we show that the oxygen coupling reaction is kinetically difficult on metallic Pt surfaces below 1.4 V. There is no facile O coupling channels on Pt(111), as the barriers are no less than 1 eV. Although an O + OH --> OOH reaction can eventually occur at the stepped sites with an increase of local O coverage and the calculated barrier is lower than 0.7 eV at 1.4 V (NHE), at such high potentials the (111) surface can already undergo surface oxidation due to the penetration of oxygen into sublayers. The theory thus indicates that oxygen evolution on Pt anode occurs on Pt surface oxides as dictated by thermodynamics and also demonstrates that the local surface structure and coverage can be more important in affecting the barrier of surface reactions than the electric fields.									63	5	0	0	6	0	66			1932-7447			WOS:000266447600049		
J	Chen, Lihong; Deng, Ruxin; Guo, Shaoshi; Yu, Zihuan; Yao, Huiqin; Wu, Zhenglong; Shi, Keren; Li, Huifeng; Ma, Shulan								Synergistic effect of V and Fe in Ni/Fe/V ternary layered double hydroxides for efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction								FRONTIERS OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING											10.1007/s11705-022-2179-6		AUG 2022			2022	High-performance and stable electrocatalysts are vital for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, via a one-pot hydrothermal method, Ni/Fe/V ternary layered double hydroxides (NiFeV-LDH) derived from Ni foam are fabricated to work as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for OER. By changing the feeding ratio of Fe and V salts, the prepared ternary hydroxides were optimized. At an Fe:V ratio of 0.5:0.5, NiFeV-LDH exhibits outstanding OER activity superior to that of the binary hydroxides, requiring overpotentials of 269 and 274 mV at 50 mA(.)cm(-2) in the linear sweep voltammetry and sampled current voltammetry measurements, respectively. Importantly, NiFeV-LDH shows extraordinary long-term stability (not greater than or equal to 75 h) at an extremely high current density of 200 mA(.)cm(-2). In contrast, the binary hydroxides present quick decay at 200 mA(.)cm(-2) or even reduced current densities (150 and 100 mA(.)cm(-2)). The outstanding OER performance of NiFeV-LDH benefits from the synergistic effect of V and Fe while doping the third metal into bimetallic hydroxide layers: (a) Fe plays a crucial role as the active site; (b) electron-withdrawing V stabilizes the high valence state of Fe, thus accelerating the OER process; (c) V further offers great stabilization for the formed intermediate of FeOOH, thus achieving superior durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000842725400001

However, the practical performance of the pristine NiFe-NDC MOFs is far from satisfaction towards the electrocatalytic water oxidation for the sluggish ion-transport. Herein, we report a co-coordination approach to afford dual-ligand NiFe electrocatalysts (NiFe-NDCxBDC1-x) with striking oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Except for the 2,6-naphalene dicarboxylic acid (NDC), 1,4-terephthalic acid (BDC) is adopted as the co-coordination ligand to tune the electronic and structural configuration of the catalysts via the unique ligand processability of the MOFs. The optimal NiFe-NDC0.9BDC0.1 displays a superior performance for OER catalysis with an overpotential of 295 mV when current density arrives at 10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope is 69.4 mV dec(-1), as well as excellent stability in alkaline media. In-situ Raman and ex-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further indicates that introduction of BDC ligands not only strengthen the interaction between Ni and Fe atoms, but also facilitate the deeper conversion from MOF to active NiOOH species, especially the higher proportion of beta-NiOOH species which can greatly promote the OER performance.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000805439300002

In addition, these hierarchical Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 powders consist of non-cubic TiO2 derived from defect sites of Ti3C2Tx and MoS2 sheets preventing inner Ti3C2Tx@TiO2 from corrosion of electrolyte covered these layered Ti3C2Tx particles accompanied with heterojunction interface and plentiful exposed active sites. In this work, the electrochemical performance of multicomponent mixed manganese oxides prepared by rapid electrodeposition is restricted by the poor electrical conductivity, but the addition of Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 can improve the surface area to electrolyte, enhance the Faradaic reaction and reduce ion diffusion length. Thus, the NF/MnOx-Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 sample can incorporate these electrochemical advantages of NF/MnOx and Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2. By characterization of as-prepared samples, it finds that these samples are combined amorphous phases with crystalline, so they can commonly improve the electrochemical performance by synergistic reaction. As the result of electrochemical test shown, the NF/MnOx-Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 sample performs excellent oxygen evolution performance and possesses a low overpotential of 270 mV with the current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The stability of the NF/MnOx-Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 sample is evaluated under 10 mA/cm(2) for 42 h and the overpotential maintains unchanged during the whole test. Thus, the NF/MnOx-Ti3C2Tx@TiO2/MoS2 sample can serve as excellent catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000698098000001

Here we demonstrate a facile and improved approach to convert biodegradable cedar wood into graphene embedded with various metal nanocrystals (cedar-LIG-M, LIG is laser-induced graphene, M = Cu, Co, Ni, Fe, NiFe) by sonication-assisted soaking and one-step CO2 laser scribing. Organic biomass was transformed to hierarchical porous graphene via laser induction, whereas metal salts were reduced to elemental metals simultaneously by the carbothermal reaction and reducing atmosphere generated during the lignocellulose decomposition. The as-prepared cedar-LIG-M possesses an ordered porous structure, good conductivity, unique ferromagnetic behavior and excellent electrochemical catalytic performance. As a demonstration, the cedar-LIG-NiFe electrode has a low overpotential of 296 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reactions. The performance of the electrode continued to improve at the initial testing stage due to the in situ activation as a result of the increased oxidation states of nickel and iron during electrochemical oxygen evolution. In addition, the cedar-LIG-NiFe could also serve as an electromagnetic interference shielding material with shielding effectiveness up to 54 dB. The simplicity and versatility of this technique provides a route for the synthesis of various carbon-based hybrid materials with potential applications of the products in many different fields, such as energy storage, electrocatalysis, electromagnetic interference shielding, and water treatment.									58	3	0	0	6	0	61			2574-0970			WOS:000461401000071

Pt nanostructured thin films (NSTF) were coated with a Ru0.1Ir0.9 OER catalyst at loadings ranging from 1 to 10 mu g cm(-2) and submitted to 5000 potential cycles within a membrane electrode assembly. Analysis of the as-deposited catalyst showed that the Ir and Ru coating is primarily metallic, and further evidence is provided to support the previously reported interaction between Ru and the perylene-red support. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used to observe the impact of the OER catalysts on Pt dissolution and migration into the membrane. Elemental mapping showed a high percentage of the Ir catalyst was maintained on the NSTF whisker surfaces following testing. The presence of the OER catalysts greatly reduced the smoothing of the Pt NSTF whiskers, which has been correlated with Pt dissolution and losses in electrochemically active surface area. The dissolution of both Ir and Pt led to the formation of IrPt nanoparticle clusters in the membrane close to the cathode, as well as the formation of a Pt band deeper in the membrane.

However, the utilization of the electronic coupling effect between two different NiMo-based materials containing different anions to further boost both the HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance has not been achieved to date. Herein, we report the electrodeposition of NH4NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O-MoOx on Ni1-2xMoxSe nanowires grown on nickel foam (NF) for the construction of heterostructured core@shell Ni1-2xMoxSe@NH4NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O-MoOx/NF as an efficient, stable hydrogen-evolving cathode and oxygen-evolving anode for overall water splitting. The strong electronic interactions between the NH4NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O-MoOx shell and Ni1-2xMoxSe nanowire core in combination with the peculiarities of the nickel-based oxysalt, NH4NiPO4 center dot 6H(2)O, significantly lower the adsorption energy of water splitting intermediates on the heterostructure and improve the coverage of water adsorption and thus give rise to enhanced HER, OER, and overall water splitting performance. As a result, the heterostructured catalyst can afford a geometrical current density (j) of 10 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low overpotential (eta) of 31 and 205 mV (after ohmic-drop correction) for the HER and OER, respectively, and at an alkaline cell voltage of 1.49 V for overall water splitting. Concomitantly, outstanding long-term durability is achieved for all these reactions in alkaline media.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000704930800001

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal the manganese and ruthenium species produced at an annealing temperature of 600 degrees C to be Mn2O3 and RuO2/Ru, respectively. A number of the mixed Mn/Ru oxides exhibit overpotential values approximately 200 mV lower than previously reported for Mn2O3/RuO2 oxides (at a current density of 10 mAcm(-2)) for the OER, whereas the Mn 50 material exhibits similar overpotentials reported in the literature for RuO2. Turnover frequency (TOF) numbers for the Mn/Ru oxides were also calculated, and the results show that the TOF values for some of the materials in this work are higher than RuO2. XPS analysis indicates a change in chemical environment of the Mn/Ru materials, which exhibit higher TOF values. Subsequently, the pure Ru 100 material used in this study has a lower overpotential at 10 mAcm(-2), as compared to previously reported values in the literature for RuO2 in alkaline media. This may be attributed to the presence of metallic Ru found in the film or the decrease in crystallite size, as determined by XRD. XPS analysis was also carried out after the OER to help determine the order of activity of the materials in this work.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2196-0216			WOS:000388382300017

Controllable synthesis of nanosized Co3O4 with excellent catalytic properties and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for conversion and storage of sustainable source-derived electricity. Herein, Ru and Ni co-doped Co3O4 nanoparticles (Ru/Ni-Co3O4) with abundant active sites and oxygen vacancies were synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. Ru atoms doped into the octahedral sites improve the intrinsic activity of spinel oxide Co3O4, while the introduction of Ni creates abundant oxygen vacancies, thus exposing more active sites at the surface and accelerating the OER kinetics. The optimized Ru/Ni-Co3O4 nanoparticles possess a low overpotential (290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability (only 1% activity decay after 10 h), significantly superior to the state-of-the-art IrO2 and most OER electrocatalysts reported before. This work provides a new strategy to increase the density of the active sites and generate surface oxygen vacancies simultaneously without destroying the crystallinity/microstructure and use of any additional complicated treatments (such as plasma techniques and multi-step pyrolysis).									11	1	0	0	0	0	11				2052-1537		WOS:000534239200008

The reasonable interfacial models of LixO2 (x = 4, 2, and 1) molecules adsorbed on early TMCs surfaces were used to simulate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes. Taking overpotentials as a merit parameter of catalytic activity, more relationships between material properties relative to the adsorption/desorption behavior of active molecules and catalytic activity are constructed for early TMCs. The equilibrium and charging potentials used to calculate the OER overpotentials of early TMCs are inversely proportional to the adsorption energies of (Li2O)(2) and LiO2, respectively. The ORR overpotentials are inversely proportional to the adsorption energies of (Li2O)(2) and LiO2 for early TMCs, but the relationship between OER overpotentials and the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates is unclear. Additionally, the overpotentials of early TMCs for ORR and OER are proportional to the desorption energies of Li+ and O-2, respectively. In general, both the adsorption energy of (Li2O)(2)/LiO2 and desorption energy of Li+/O-2 are effective characterization parameters of catalytic activity. By providing the comprehensive valuable parameters on electrochemical performance to compare the catalytic activity of early TMCs and establishing more correlations between material properties relative to the adsorption/desorption behavior of active molecules with their catalytic activity, our investigation is helpful for knowing more about the catalytic process and beneficial to screen and design novel highly active catalysts for Li-O-2 batteries.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000453231100012	30500014

Herein, we report the outstanding OER performance of Co9S8@CoS2 heterojunctions synthesized by hydrogen etched CoS2, where the optimized heterojunction shows a low eta(50) of 396 mV and a small Tafel slope of 181.61 mV dec(-1). The excellent electrocatalytic performance of this heterostructure is attributed to the interface electronic effect. Importantly, the post-stage characterization results indicate that the Co9S8@CoS2 heterostructure exhibits a dynamic reconfiguration during the OER with the formation of CoOOH in situ, and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000716016600001	35480289

Herein we report that inexpensive cheap copper oxide thin film material can be used as an excellent electrocatalyst precursor for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) thin films were facilely electrodeposited on conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates from a simple Cu(II) salt solution under a very low applied potential (-0.17 V or -0.23 V). Two kinds of morphologies (dendritic branching and cluster-like) of Cu2O were obtained just by altering the deposition potentials. Both Cu2O films can be used for OER, and the dendritic branching Cu2O material exhibits better performance. Under optimal conditions, OER was achieved under an onset potential at similar to 0.92 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 M borate solution at pH 9.2. A catalytic current density of similar to 0.1 mA/cm(2) required a low overpotential of similar to 430 mV using the electrodeposited Cu2O material under an optimal condition. The slope of the Tafel plot is similar to 59.9 mV/dec and the Faradaic efficiency was close to 93%. The samples were well characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

CoFe alloy and nitrogen doped carbon (CoFe-NC) material was prepared by a one-step carbonization procedure to construct a highly efficient electrocatalysis in this work. CoFe-NC displays a three-dimensional (3D) flower-like morphology composed of ordered stacked 2D nanosheets, which is entangled by 1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Its structure and electrocatalytic performance are compared with that of nitrogen doped carbon materials obtained from 2D zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) with no metal or single metal, as well as 3D ZIF with bimetal. Benefiting from the multi-dimensional structure of bimetal nanoparticles, 1D CNTs, 2D nanosheets, and 3D flowers, as well as the abundant active sites of Co/Fe-N (x) and pyridine nitrogen, CoFe-NC displays a high half-wave potential of 0.896 V for ORR and low overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER. Furthermore, compared with the primary and rechargeable Zn-air batteries fabricated with commercial Pt/C-RuO2 catalysts, the CoFe-NC catalysts assembled Zn-air batteries show a higher specific capacity (812.2 mAh g(-1)), open circuit potential (1.59 V), power density (183.4 mW cm(-2)), and stability. Hence, a facile and environmental-friendly strategy is provided for rational design and synthesis of bifunctional electrocatalysts for zinc-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000849946000001	35914475

Various physicochemical parameters for zeolite template and/or IrxRu1-xO2 were obtained by SEM, TEM, XRD, EDX and N-2 gas absorption/desorption measurements. The morphology for prepared IrxRu1-xO2 samples with individual and/or cluster nanorods was changed with the component difference. Cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, steady state polarization curves and stability tests were performed to investigate the catalytic activity and stability of these electrocatalysts for OER. The cell with catalyst RuO2 showed best catalytic performance with the lowest onset potential (1.374 V at 10 mA cm(-2)), which may be ascribed to regular nanoclusters and larger outer active surface area. Meanwhile, the cell stability tests suggested that the addition of IrO2 in IrxRu1-xO2 improved the stability of the RuO2 catalyst. Copyright (c) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

An overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 56 mV per decade is achieved with nickel borate (Ni-B-i) support, which is comparable to the benchmark RuO2 under similar experimental conditions. An average faradaic yield of similar to 98% is achieved, indicating that any contribution from impurities is absent due to the use of alkaline medium. A turnover frequency increased by eight-fold is attained with the support of Ni-B-i by virtue of the Ni(ii) <-> Ni(iii) redox couple. The mechanistic surface kinetics pathway at crossover potentials between the Mn2CuO4 and RuO2 systems is studied using electrochemical impedance. The efficiency of the modified catalyst can be attributed to the dual redox cycle of both the dimanganese copper oxide and nickel borate responsible for the charge transfer within the system. Further experiments were performed to check the effect of trace iron impurity in the standard reagent-grade chemicals.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000639314100001

The as-prepared Fe3C@N-F-GCNTs exhibited excellent ORR and OER performances, with the ORR half-wave potential positive than that of Pt/C by 14 mV, and the OER overpotential lowered to 432 mV at the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2). In addition, the Delta E value (oxygen electrode activity parameter) increased to 0.827 V, which is comparable to the performance of the best nonprecious metal catalysts reported to date.

The hydrophobicity of electrodes is measured by the contact angle of the PTFE-modified Ru0.3Ti0.7O2 electrodes. The morphologies of electrodes with various amounts of PTFE are observed by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and an atomic force microscope (AFM). The effects of PTFE-content on the electrochemical characteristics of PTFE-modified electrodes are evaluated by the measurements of voltammetric charge, polarization and ac-impedance. The behavior of oxygen evolution and the performance of electrodes depende significantly on the hydrophobicity of PTFE-modified electrodes. The electrode prepared from a dipping solution with 21.1 vol% PTFE have the best performance in terms of the largest number of active sites and the highest site activity. The variation in performance of electrodes for oxygen evolution with PTFE-content is related to the variation in active site dispersion, morphology and bubble behaviors of the electrode.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0253-3839			WOS:000076084000002

Herein, the facile synchronous reduction method and screen-printing process are applied to obtain an Ru-rGO catalyst with a 3D porous architecture and oxygen electrodes. Significantly, an ultra-long cycling Li-O-2 cell is designed using catalytic membrane decoration. The catalytic membrane is fabricated via electrospinning polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers directly onto a separator. Then, Ag nanowires and Au nanoparticles are coated on previously obtained PAN scaffolds. After comparing initial Ru-rGO electrode with decorated Ru-rGO (D-Ru-rGO), we infer that the cell with D-Ru-rGO catalyst exhibits enhanced cycling performance towards ORR and OER, higher specific discharge capacity (13437.8 mA h g(-1)), extended cycling stability, desirable rate performance, and a lower voltage gap. The insulating PAN polymer framework can directly restrict electron transfer to the Ag/Au catalyst and effectively prevent Ag/Au catalytic sites from direct blockage. Thus, the efficient and effective method proposed in this study offers a new insight into architecture designing and synergetic surface/interface strategy settling.									19	7	0	0	3	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000449701900024

The cobalt porphyrin/carbon electrocatalysts were prepared by loading a cobalt porphyrin complex on a carbon support, followed by heat treatment under argon atmosphere. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the maximum catalytic activity was obtained after heat treatment at 1000 degrees C. The turnover frequency was similar to 0.078 s(-1) based on cobalt under an applied anodic potential of 1.31 V (vs NHE) at pH = 9.2. The catalyst was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). These results indicate that the pyrolyzed cobalt porphyrin/carbon nanomaterial is a promising catalyst for OER. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we employ density functional methods based on the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional with dispersion correction and the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional (HSE06) to investigate the mechanisms of the nucleation and decomposition processes of Li4O2(s), i.e., discharge and charge processes on single-layer Tl2O (SL-Tl2O) in lithium-oxygen batteries. HSE06 with the spin-orbital coupling effect is adopted to calculate the band gap of SL-Tl2O. It is demonstrated that the spin-orbital coupling effect is significant in predictions of not only electronic but also thermodynamic properties for heavy-element compounds such as Tl2O. The formation of LiO2(s) is initiated by the adsorption of oxygen molecules instead of lithium atoms on the surface. The intermediate reaction products strongly interact with SL-Tl2O, which causes an overpotential of 1.47 V during the electrochemical reaction. The electronic conductivity analysis of lithium oxides adsorbed on SL-Tl2O demonstrates that the electronic conductance of the layer does not change during the ORR/OER. The adsorption enthalpies of five frequently used nonaqueous solvents (tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,3-dioxolane, dimethyl carbonate, and propiolic acid) on SL-Tl2O indicate that SL-Tl2O is stable in the electrolytes. All of these calculated results indicate that SL-Tl2O is a feasible catalyst for the ORR/OER in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000529873300001

Herein, we demonstrate an effective oxygen-induced surface electron density modulation strategy to significantly boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities of carbon nanotubes. Experimental and theoretical studies conjointly reveal that the incorporation of electron-drawing oxygen atoms in the conjugated carbon nanotube plane imparts a relatively high positive charge density on adjacent carbon atoms, making them energetically favorable for OOH* adsorption in OER and OH* desorption in ORR. Such oxygen-modulated carbon nanotubes display excellent bifunctional catalytic activity toward both ORR and OER. The as-fabricated aqueous and flexible all-solid-state ZABs display superb peak power densities of 130.5 mW cm(-2) and 103.5 mW cm(-2) with good durability, outstripping most of recently reported ZABs. This surface electron density modulation method may open up valuable insights for designing other robust carbon electrocatalysts for ZABs and beyond.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			2405-8297			WOS:000544759900002

In this study, firstly, nickel nanocones (NNCs) were formed using electrochemical deposition, and then Ni-Co-Fe based mixed sulfide ultrathin nanosheets were obtained by directly depositing on the surface of the nanocones using the CV method. With a hierarchical structure of Ni-Fe-Co-S nanosheets, not only was a high active surface area created, but also the electron transfer and mass transfer were enhanced. This structure also led to the faster release of hydrogen bubbles from the surface. An overpotential value of 106 mV was required on the surface of this electrode to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the HER, whereas, for the OER, 207 mV overpotential was needed to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, this electrode required 1.54 V potential to generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the total electrochemical water splitting. The resulting electrode also exhibited reasonable electrocatalytic stability, and after 10 hours of electrolysis in the overall water splitting reaction, the voltage change was negligible.

Hence, exploiting an ideal bifunctional catalyst, e.g. the one includes dual active sites for both reactions, is of high interest and importance. Herein, a novel nonprecious-metal bifunctional catalyst based on a quaternary mixed metal sulfide synergized with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NiCoMnS4/N-rGO) is synthesized through a simple anion-exchange route. The unique composition and synergism arising from uniformly anchoring the metal sulfide nanoparticles on N-rGO endow the as-prepared catalyst with remarkable electrocatalytic activity and durability towards ORR and OER. Importantly, the excellent electrocatalytic performance of NiCoMnS4/NrGO hybrid was demonstrated in rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) as a real application. Accordingly, rechargeable ZABs assembled by NiCoMnS4/N-rGO hybrid-based air cathodes exhibit high capacity, energy density and excellent rate capability as well as favorable cycling stability. The outstanding performance of this NiCoMnS4/N-rGO hybrid together with the simplicity of synthetic method, make this hybrid promising as a highly efficient air-cathode catalyst for energy-related applications including high-performance rechargeable ZABs.									29	1	0	0	1	0	29			2405-8297			WOS:000472961700021

Catalysts with a size distribution in the nanometer range perform efficiently because of the availability of numerous active sites. Carbonaceous composites of materials derived from transition metal series are exploited as bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reactions in the Li-O-2 batteries. Cobalt nitride (Co4N) as predicted by density functional theory is believed to possess metallic properties. In this study, we have examined the viability of Co4N nanoparticles to oxygen reactions in Li-O-2 batteries. Oxidized multiwall carbon nanotubes are further added to Co4N nanoparticles to form a composite. Structural characterizations reveal that nanoparticles arranged conformally around the nanotubes, creating active centers for both oxygen evolution and reduction through the nanotube as a charge-transport channel. Electrochemical measurements for Li-O-2 characteristics are performed on both pristine and composite catalysts. The composite catalyst shows a very high specific capacity of 3312 mAh/g after adding the oxidized nanotube. The charge-transfer resistance obtained from the impedance spectra reveal a lower resistance of the composite than the pristine sample, retaining the former's specific capacity until 80 continuous cycles.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000437811500023

Herein, a simple approach is used to produce composite material based on TiO2/Co3O4 for efficient OER and overpotential is linearly reduced with increasing amount of TiO2. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) investigations reveal the wire like morphology of composite materials, formed by the self-assembly of nanoparticles. The titania nanoparticles were homogenously distributed on the larger Co3O4 nanoparticles. The powder x-ray diffraction revealed a tetragonal phase of TiO2 and the cubic phase of Co3O4 in the composite materials. Composite samples with increasing TiO2 content were obtained (18%, 33%, 41% and 65% wt.). Among the composites, cobalt oxide-titanium oxide with the highest TiO2 content (CT-20) possesses the lowest overpotential for OER with a Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1) and an exchange current density of 2.98 x 10(-3)A/cm(2). The CT-20 is highly durable for 45 h at different current densities of 10, 20 and 30 mA/cm(2). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed the fast charge transport for the CT-20 sample, which potentially accelerated the OER kinetics. These results based on a two-step methodology for the synthesis of TiO2/Co3O4 material can be useful and interesting for various energy storage and energy conversion systems.

However, the aforementioned materials would be more auspicious, especially for photoelectrocatalysis, if their optical properties fell within the range of the solar spectrum. These properties could be attained by either doping or by creating a specific crystal structure. In this study nickel(II) tellurium oxide was synthesized by employing the Pechini sol-gel synthesis route and calcined at 400 degrees C (NTO-400), 600 degrees C (NTO-600), and 800 degrees C (NTO-800). It was physically characterized and (photo)electrochemically tested for the OER in alkaline medium. Under electrocatalytic (EC) conditions, NTO-600 displayed the lowest overpotential, 353 mV, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance of 20.75 Omega. Under photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) conditions, NTO-600 (with a bandgap of 2.50 eV) realized a current density increase of 55% compared to pure EC conditions. Remarkably, this current density gain is (to a greater extent) maintained, subsequent to the termination of illumination, which points to photocharging of the material and the subsequent utilization of the stored charge to drive the OER (in the dark). Solar energy conversion, storage, and subsequent utilization is therefore realized through the use of nickel(II) tellurium oxide.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900047		
J	Ye, Zhi-Guo; Meng, Hui-Min; Sun, Dong-Bai								New degradation mechanism of Ti/IrO2 + MnO2 anode for oxygen evolution in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				53	18			5639	5643		10.1016/j.electacta.2008.03.025				JUL 20 2008	2008	Degradation mechanism of Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode for oxygen evolution was studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution by field emission scanning electron microscopes (FESEM), Tafel slope, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS). The whole surface of the non-electrolyzed Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode consisted of nano-IrO2 poles array. The anode surface had hardly discovered cracks and had compact morphology that can prevent the electrolyte from entering the Ti/oxide interface and an insulating TiO2 film from growing on the Ti-based surface. An insulating TiO2 phase had not been generated on the Ti/oxide interface cluring the process of O-2 evolution and the inactive anode surface still remained mass of the IrO2 and MnO2 OXides.The chemical dissolution of Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode coating was not the main reason for electrode degradation in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The degradation mechanism of Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode differed from other conventional oxide electrodes for 02 evolution in acid medium. The platforms of Tafel slope and anode potential (900-1050 h) indicated that the change of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism was the main reason for degradation of Ti/IrO2(0.7) + MnO2(0.3) anode due to the change of adsorption intermediate.

However, the fundamental catalytic mechanism of SACs during the charge/discharge process is still unclear. Herein, we report a real-time imaging of the microscopic evolution of single-atom Co/reduced graphene oxide (SA-Co/rGO) in Na-O-2 nanobatteries via an in situ environmental transmission electron microscope. Clearly, Na2O2 spheres were formed on the surface of the SA-Co/rGO scaffold during discharging, which can be easily decomposed during charging. In contrast, the formation and decomposition of Na2O2 on bare rGO without SACs were very sluggish. Moreover, a coin cell Na-O-2 battery with an SA-Co/rGO air cathode also displays superior performance to a bare rGO cathode. DFT calculations reveal that the local coordination environment (Co + 4N) played a key role in tuning the charge density and oxidation states of the isolated Co active sites, thus activating O-2 molecules and facilitating the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction processes. This study suggests that SA-Co/rGO may be a promising catalyst for enhancing the performance of Na-O-2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000719983000001

Although oxygen vacancies at atomic level can efficiently regulate electronic configuration and ameliorate electrochemical performance, the construction of rich bulk oxygen vacancies is still a challenge. Here, rich oxygen vacancies were successfully introduced in bulk MnO2 through complex induced chemical precipitation. Enhanced electrical conductivity and local electric-field formed around oxygen vacancies promote the charge transfer, remarkably enhancing capacitance and rate capability. Asymmetric supercapacitor of MnO2 with rich bulk oxygen vacancies exhibits high energy density (54.2 Wh kg(-1)) and power density (3279.6 W kg(-1)), superior to most reported MnO2-based supercapacitor. Our strategy paves a way for the fine regulation of bulk electronic configuration and reaction kinetics.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500194

In this work, a highly active and durable bifunctional catalyst of coral-like nickel iron phosphide ultrathin nanosheets anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays on carbon cloth (CC-NC-NiFeP) was fabricated by using metal organic framework (MOF) derived nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflake arrays as catalyst supports. Combined with the electronic structure regulation by bimetallic phosphides and using three dimensional nitrogen-doped carbon nanoflakes as supports that provide a large specific surface area as well as fast charge/mass transport, the as-prepared CC-NC-NiFeP yields excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in both the HER and OER in an alkaline medium with an overpotential of 94 mV and 145 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Meanwhile, the CC-NC-NiFeP can behave as both a cathode and anode simultaneously for overall water splitting, achieving a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms that of most of the non-precious metal based catalysts.									38	2	0	0	1	0	38			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000529201500038	32239068

To improve hydrogen production capability, it is critical to search for low-cost, earth abundant, and superior catalytic activity materials as electrocatalysts for water oxidation. Herein, one-step chemical transformation strategy is utilized to synthesize cobalt sulfide nanosheets supported on the carbon cloth through the sulfuration process of the Co3O4 precursor. The catalyst exposes abundant active sites and facilitates charge transfer, which is beneficial to water oxidation. In alkaline electrolyte, the catalyst as a non noble metal electrode exhibits sparkly performance for water oxidation. To achieve current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), the overpotentials as low as 291 and 364 mV are demanded, respectively. Moreover, cobalt sulfide nanosheets on the carbon cloth manifest a small Tafel slope of 69 mV dec(-1) and robust long-term durability. In addition, this one-step chemical transformation strategy can be utilized to synthesize cobalt selenide nanosheets on the carbon cloth, providing an orientation for developing other binder-free electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000445317900007

To obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency associated with overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten per cent(1,2). Thus, whether a particulate photocatalyst can enable a quantum efficiency of 100 per cent for the greatly endergonic water-splitting reaction remains an open question. Here we demonstrate overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96 per cent at wavelengths between 350 and 360 nanometres, which is equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of almost unity, using a modified aluminium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst(3,4). By selectively photodepositing the cocatalysts Rh/Cr2O3 (ref.(5)) and CoOOH (refs.(3,6)) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, on different crystal facets of the semiconductor particles using anisotropic charge transport, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions could be promoted separately. This enabled multiple consecutive forward charge transfers without backward charge transfer, reaching the upper limit of quantum efficiency for overall water splitting. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of overall water splitting free from charge recombination losses and introduces an ideal cocatalyst/photocatalyst structure for efficient water splitting.									581	37	0	0	37	0	583			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000575801600001	32461647

However, improving the electrocatalytic efficiency with the use of minimal amount of Pt is very challenging. A new strategy has been developed to fabricate a "double nanoporous" structure, in which nanoporous PtFe alloy (np-PtFe) is embedded in nanoporous graphene (NPG), through in situ etching and acid leaching treatments. The np-PtFe/NPG-700 served as an effective bifunctional catalyst for both HER and ORR, exhibiting higher activity and stability than 20% Pt/C. Theoretical calculations reveal that the graphene nanopores not only play a vital role in improving the stability of the nanoporous PtFe alloy but also downshift the d-band center of the PtFe alloy, thus improving the catalytic activity. The double nanoporous structure also provides numerous diffusion channels, which facilitated the mass and charge transport during HER and ORR.									28	2	0	0	1	0	29			2196-7350			WOS:000399031000011

Herein, we firstly report the controllable synthesis of Co2P nanorods through a substrate- and template-free facile phosphating reaction. Electrochemical test results reveal that the synthesized Co2P nanorods exhibit superior bifunctional activity with overpotentials of 87 mV for HER and 310 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, relative to Co2P/CoP branched nanostructure, CoP nanoparticles and commercial Co2P in alkaline media. In addition, the bifunctional Co2P nanorods catalysts enable overall water splitting with a cell voltage of 1.65 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) and stabilized potentials at different current densities testing over 24 h. Further analysis demonstrate that the remarkably bifunctional activity is contributed to high charge transfer efficiency, large contact area with electrolyte and a large number of exposed active sites provided by the rod-like nanostructure. This work should shed light on an industrialized pathway for the future design of phosphide catalysts to apply to overall water splitting even other emerging energy devices.									41	5	0	0	2	0	43			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000449447800042

Herein, we report hierarchical steam-activated reduced graphene oxide (srGO)/Fe hybrid architectures branched by nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) for bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Through the adequate choice of ferrocene precursor and microwave method, the CNT branches, the active iron phase, and N-doping are accomplished simultaneously to construct a bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst. The Fe2O3/N-CNT@srGO hybrid architecture achieves an ORR onset potential of 0.72 V, a mass activity of 605.30 mA.mg(active)(-1), an OER onset potential of 1.63 V, and a Tafel slope of 61 mV.dec(-1), which are much higher compared to those of the Fe2O3/CNT@srGO, Fe2O3@N-srGO, and Fe2O3@N-CNT catalysts. These results indicate the enhancement of bifunctional catalytic activity due to hierarchical porous structure, CNT branches, and N-doping. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

A large surface area and proper surface atomic configuration are essential to explore potentiality of MoxC in electrochemical applications. Although considerable efforts are made on the development of advanced MoxC-based catalysts for energy conversion with high efficiency and stability, some urgent issues, such as low electronic conductivity, low catalytic efficiency, and structural instability, have to be resolved in accordance with their application environments. Surface and interface engineering have shown bright prospects to construct highly efficient MoxC-based electrocatalysts for energy conversion including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. In this Review, the recent progresses in terms of surface and interface engineering of MoxC-based electrocatalytic materials are summarized, including the increased number of active sites by decreasing the particle size or introducing porous or hierarchical structures and surface modification by introducing heteroatom(s), defects, carbon materials, and others electronic conductive species. Finally, the challenges and prospects for energy conversion on MoxC-based nanomaterials are discussed in terms of key performance parameters for the catalytic performance.									49	3	0	0	6	0	50			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000486863800001	31532899

Scaling up of such catalysts is hampered by the high price of Ir. We demonstrate in this work that IrO2 can be promoted by Mn in terms of electrochemical performance at nearly similar stability. The enhancement in electrochemical performance can be attributed to a higher electrochemically active surface and a higher intrinsic activity of the Ir-Mn oxide surface. Mn promotion led to lower Tafel slopes and higher surface-normalized current densities and can be related to the introduction of Mn in the crystalline structure of IrO2. Specifically, the introduction of Mn led to an increased amount of Ir3+ species at the surface, which are thought to be involved in the OER. Extensive characterization showed that the fresh anodes consisted of Mn-doped IrO2 with Mn3O4 at higher Mn content. The latter spinel oxides were easily removed during initial anodic polarization. The synergy between Ir and Mn is maintained during chronopotentiometric stability test. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The investigation on surface-micro-structure-sensitive catalytic activity in different pH media is of great significance for developing efficient electrocatalysts and corresponding mechanism research. Herein, shape-tunable Ir-Pd alloy nanocrystals, including nano-hollow-spheres (NHSs), nanowires (NWs), and nanotetrahedrons (NTs), are synthesized via a facile one-pot solvothermal method. Electrochemical studies show that the OER activity of the Ir-Pd alloy nanocatalysts exhibits surface-microstructure-sensitive enhancement in acidic and alkaline media. Ir-Pd NWs and NTs show more than five times higher mass activity than commercial Ir/C catalyst at an overpotential of 0.25 V in acidic and alkaline media. Post-XPS analyses reveal that surface Ir(VI) oxide generated at surface defective sites of Ir-Pd nanocatalysts is a possible key intermediate for OER. In acidic medium, the specific activity of Ir-Pd nanocatalysts has a positive correlation with the surface roughness of NWs > NHSs > NTs. However, the strong dissociation of surface Ir(VI) species (IrO42-) at surface defective sites is a possible obstacle for the formation of Ir(VI) oxide, which reverses the activity sequence for OER in alkaline medium.									31	5	0	0	2	0	31			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000439326400003

Herein, we have constructed a 2D heterostructured NiFe2O4/NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) mixed composite on a low-cost stainless-steel mesh substrate using a low-temperature one-step wet chemical synthesis method and have also investigated the effect of starting material concentration on the formation of the NiFe2O4/NiFe LDH mixed composite. The as-prepared NiFe2O4/NiFe LDH-25 electrocatalyst drives a 100 mA/cm(2) OER with the lowest reported overpotential of 190 mV and a Tafel slope 21.5 mV/dec and drives a stable 100 mA/cm(2) OER process in 1 M KOH. These OER activities are superior to that of the state-of-the-art RuO2 OER electrocatalyst. The excellent OER activity appears to be due to the synergetic effect of NiFe LDHs and NiFe2O4. In addition, the vertically aligned heterostructure of the NiFe2O4/NiFe LDH composite thin sheets provides a large number of active edge sites, directly attached to the highly conducting substrate, which contributes to improving the electronic conductivity of the electrocatalyst. This work provides valuable insight into the design and one-step synthesis of NiFe2O4/NiFe LDH bimetallic mixed oxide and hydroxide composite thin films with enhanced OER activity and stability as well as deciphering the origin of the OER enhancement by metal oxides and metal hydroxides.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2574-0962			WOS:000595488500059

For the first time, in-situ Raman spectroscopy was used to study the structural change of the NiFe catalyst, associated with the effects of the concentration of F during the OER process. At a moderate concentration of F, it was found that; (1) the catalysts have a well-conductive hybrid structure composed of NiFeOOH (474 cm(-1) and 544 cm(-1)), FeOOH (715 cm(-1)) and NiF2 (310 cm(-1)) phases, and (2) F promotes an optimum mass ratio between Ni and Fe, which helps in the collaborative operation between Ni and Fe. This led to generation of catalysts with an optimum structure portraying excellent OER performance. Specifically, the synthesized catalysts required explicit low overpotential of 259 mV to generate current density of 100 mAcm(-2), Tafel slope of 60.3 mVdec(-1), high charge transfer rate signified by low resistance of 1.46 Omega, and high number of active OER sites implied by large double layer capacitance of 2.90 mF. This study shades light to the understanding of the involved vital phases of F-NiFe catalysts and how F mediates the active phases during the OER process, hence contributing to the knowledge required for the designing of better catalysts for future electrodes.

Buddie								Structural and Catalytic Effects of Iron- and Scandium-Doping on a Strontium Cobalt Oxide Electrocatalyst for Water Oxidation								ACS CATALYSIS				6	2			1122	1133		10.1021/acscatal.5b02429				FEB 2016	2016	The poor kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are a considerable barrier to the development of water-derived hydrogen fuel. Previous work regarding theoretical calculations of the perovskite SrCoO3-delta(SCO) predicts a surface binding energy ideal for OER catalysis but could not be matched to experimental results due to the material's propensity to form the incorrect trigonal crystal structure. By doping with iron and scandium, X-ray diffraction confirms that we have been able to synthesize a series of SCO catalysts of various crystal structures, culminating in cubic SCO. In doing so, we show that there is a limited correlation between the crystal structure and OER performance in alkaline media. Instead, the use of iron as a dopant is found to decrease the OER overpotential of the SCO by 40 mV in 0.1 M KOH and yield catalysts capable of performing water oxidation at an overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA/cm(2). The doped, cubic SCO catalysts are found to be more stable than the undoped material when tested for extended periods, showing only an approximate 3 mV increase in overpotential over a 2 h period at 10 mA/cm(2). Our results show that proper doping of the B-site cation in SCO allows for tuning the structure, performance, and stability of the oxide as an OER electrocatalyst.									30	0	0	0	2	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000369774900073

The oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction of theTMN(4) embedded graphene, graphane and fluorographene are systematically investigated by the density functional theory calculations (TM = Fe, Co and Ni). Our results show that the ORR/OER activity and the stability of the TMN4 moieties are dramatically changed by the graphene functionalization. According to the free energy analysis, the H/F decoration on the carbon skeleton improves the activities of FeN4 and CoN4 moieties, in comparison with the graphene counterpart. In detail, the FeN4-based electrodes are potential ORR ones where the overpotentials are reduced from 0.98 V of G/FeN4 to 0.46 V of GH/FeN4 and 0.38 V of GF/FeN4. Meanwhile, the CoN4-based electrodes possess good OER efficiency featured with the overpotentials of 0.50 V and 0.53 V for GH/CoN4 and GF/CoN4 with respect to 0.72 V for G/CoN4, respectively. On the other side, the high thermodynamic barrier of NiN4-based electrodes limits its application, regardless of the supports. Furthermore, the binding strengths between TM and its N coordination are substantially increased due to the presence of H/F attachments, indicating the enhanced TM capture, which ascribes to the corresponding wrinkle spa(3) structure. Additionally, the structural integrity without any degradation in the molecular dynamic stimulation further supports the thermodynamic stability at the room temperature. The robustness of GH/TMN4 and GF/TMN4 illustrates the feasibility of the experimental synthesis. Considering the possible dehydrogenation of the graphane at the elevated temperature, the fluorographene with atomically dispersed FeN4 and CoN4 moieties is recommended as promising oxygen electrode. To shed light on the physical origination, the electronic structure analysis correlates the activity enhancement with the change of the TM d-orbital, being evidenced by the linearity between the OH affinity and the d band center. Therein, the influences of the graphene functionalization on the electrocatalysis provide new insights into the design of the bifunctional oxygen electrode.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700061

This study has been carried out to assess the differences between current measurements made using a 'closed' microcapillary system (the electrochemical microcell technique) with current measurements derived from a flowing 'open' microcapillary droplet cell (the scanning droplet cell). The experimental results were compared with calculations derived from a model system adopting a finite element approach. The corrosion system consists of four parallel electrochemical reactions: three cathodic reactions (the oxygen reduction reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction and water dissociation) and one anodic reaction (metal dissolution reaction). Comparative experimental results have shown there is a large discrepancy between the magnitudes of the cathodic current obtained by the two techniques. The results of this study allow an assessment of the parameters responsible for the mass transport and distribution of species in the closed and open systems. Critical parameters (for example, microcell crevice geometry, specimen surface-capillary gap distance, etc.) which lead to significant modifications of the curves were then identified using the numerical simulation.

As a case study, the catalytic activity of metallic Pd toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution has been significantly promoted by stabilizing Pd delta+ oxidic species at the interface of the Pd-metal oxide support with the help of EMSI effect, suggesting an intrinsic advantage of Pd delta+ in driving OER. We further demonstrate that the chemical state of Pd delta+ can be easily modulated in the range of 2+ to 3+ by changing the metal oxide support, interestingly, accompanied by a clear dependence of the OER activity on the oxidation state of Pd delta+. The high Pd3+ species-containing Fe2O3/Pd catalyst has fed an impressively enhanced OER property, showing an overpotential of 383 mV at 10 mA cm(2) compared to those of >600 mV on metallic Pd and 540 mV on Fe2O3/glassy carbon. The greatly enhanced OER performance is believed to primarily derive from the distinctive improvement in the adsorption of oxygenated intermediates (e.g., *OH and *OOH) on metal-oxide/Pd catalysts. Moreover, similar EMSI induced improvements in OER activity in alkaline solution are also achieved on both of the Fe2O3/Au and Fe2O3/Pt, which possess the oxidic species of Au3+, and Pt2+ and Pt4+, respectively.									44	1	0	0	3	0	45			2155-5435			WOS:000438475100099

The metallic core-oxyhydroxide layer structure is an efficient method to lower an overpotential. We synthesized Fe rich FeCo core-Co rich FeCo oxyhydroxide layer with a different particle size of 173 nm, 225 nm, and 387 nm (FeCo 173, 225, 387) through a difference in the reduction rate of Fe/Co precursors using facile modified polyol synthesis. To investigate the effect of conductivity, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles of 80-130 nm were synthesized. Among samples, FeCo 173 showed remarkable catalytic performance of 316 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 0.1 M KOH compared to RuO2 (408 mV), FeCo 225 (323 mV), FeCo 387 (334 mV), CoFe2O4 (382 mV). Moreover, FeCo 173 showed good stability for 60,000 s while RuO2 showed a gradual increase in overpotential to maintain 10 mA/cm(2) after 15,000 s in chronopotentiometry. The excellent performance was attributed to Fe-rich metallic core, a small amount of Fe doping into CoOOH, and the synergic effect between the active site of Co rich FeCoOOH and conductive Fe rich metallic core. Following this result, it shows that the use of such FeCo electrodes has advantages in the production of hydrogen via electrochemical water oxidation. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, we have combined ultrahigh vacuum surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) to quantify structure-dependent OER activity in a series of well-defined electrocatalysts. We describe a direct correlation between the population of Fe edge-site atoms and the OER activity of ultrathin Fe2O3 nanostructures (similar to 0.5 nm apparent height) grown on Au(111) substrates. Hydroxylated Fe atoms residing at edge-sites along the catalyst/support interface were spectroscopically identified as key reaction centers, and these Fe edge-site atoms were estimated to produce OER turnover frequencies approximately 150 times higher than that of Fe atoms on the catalyst surface at an applied potential of 1.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode. Impressively, ultrathin Fe2O3/Au nanostructures with a high density of catalytically active Fe edge-site atoms outperformed an ultrathin IrOx/Au catalyst at moderate overpotentials. DFT calculations revealed more favorable OER at edge sites along the Fe2O3/Au interface, with lower predicted overpotentials due to beneficial modification of intermediate binding. Our results demonstrate how a combination of surface science, electrochemistry, and computational modeling can be used to identify key structure-property relationships in a well-defined electrocatalytic system.									29	0	0	0	3	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000471212600066

The electrochemical kinetic parameters including exchange current density, Tafel slopes, reaction order with respect to [OH-] and standard electrochemical enthalpy of activation were analyzed also.

BYRAPPA, K/0000-0001-6194-9496			Ceria Boosting on In Situ Nitrogen-Doped Graphene Oxide for Efficient Bifunctional ORR/OER Activity								FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY				10						889579	10.3389/fchem.2022.889579				JUN 24 2022	2022	In the present work, a highly efficient and excellent electrocatalyst material for bifunctional oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) was synthesized using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method. In brief, ultrafine hexagonal cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were tailored on the layered surface of in situ nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (NGO) sheets. The nanocomposites exhibited a high anodic onset potential of 0.925 V vs. RHE for ORR activity and 1.2 V for OER activity with a very high current density in 0.5 M KOH. The influence of oxygen cluster on Ce3+/Ce4+ ion decoration on outward/inward in situ nitrogen-coupled GO enhanced the physicochemical properties of composites and in turn increased electron transferability. The microwave-assisted hydrothermal coupling technique provides a higher density, active sites on CeO2@NGO composites, and oxygen deficiency structures in ultrafine Ce-O particles and boosts higher charge transferability in the composites. It is believed that the physical states of Ce-N- C, Ce-C=O, and a higher amount of oxygen participation with ceria increase the density of composites that in turn increases the efficiency. N-doped graphene oxide promotes high current conduction and rapid electron transferability while reducing the external transport resistance in oxygen electrocatalysis by sufficient mass transfer through in-built channels. This study may provide insights into the knowledge of Ce-enabled bifunctional activity to guide the design of a robust catalyst for electrochemical performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000827294000001	35815209

Herein, we report hollow Ni-Co-Fe phosphide (Ni-Co-Fe-P) nanoboxes with well-defined interior spaces via a core-shell Prussian blue analogue (PBA)-dependent conversion. Starting from Ni-Co PBA nanocubes, a chemical reduction and decomposition process is utilized to fabricate core-shell Ni-Co@Fe PBA nanocubes based on the lattice matching principle, which are then phosphatized into hollow Ni-Co-Fe-P nanoboxes through an interface-induced contraction process. Thanks to well-designed hollow structures, polymetallic compositions, and doping of carbon, hollow Ni-Co-Fe-P nanobox catalyst shows a remarkable OER activity with a small overpotential of 277 mV at 20 mA cm(-2). Notably, this catalyst is also highly stable with only 5 % activity decay over 24 h for the OER. Mechanism studies reveal that the electronic regulation of precatalyst-derived (oxy)hydroxides is the key to boost their OER activity. This work demonstrates a novel and effective protocol for designing polymetallic phosphides with well-defined hollow structures towards various targeted applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000855275600001

Herein, an in situ growth method to achieve 1D structure-controllable zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) core/shell fiber (PAN@ZIFs) is developed. Subsequent pyrolysis of this precursor can obtain a heteroatom-doped carbon nanofiber network as an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. The electrocatalytic performance of derived carbon nanofiber is dominated by the structures of PAN@ZIFs fiber, which is facilely regulated by efficiently controlling the nucleation and growth process of ZIFs on the surface of polymer fiber as well as optimizing the components of ZIFs. Benefiting from the core-shell structures with appropriate dopants and porosity, as-prepared catalysts show brilliant bifunctional ORR/OER catalytic activity and durability. Finally, the rechargeable Zn-air battery assembled from the optimized catalyst (CNF@Zn/CoNC) displays a peak power density of 140.1 mW cm(-2), energy density of 878.9 Wh kg(Zn)(-1), and excellent cyclic stability over 150 h, giving a promising performance in realistic application.									91	9	0	0	5	0	92			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000432032800010	29577622

This study puts forward a new N-anion-decorated Ni3S2 material synthesized by a simple one-step calcination route, acting as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for the OER/HER for the first time. The introduction of N anions significantly modifies the morphology and electronic structure of Ni3S2, bringing high surface active sites exposure, enhanced electrical conductivity, optimal HER Gibbs free-energy (Delta G(H*)), and water adsorption energy change (Delta G(H2O*)). Remarkably, the obtained N-Ni3S2/NF 3D electrode exhibits extremely low overpotentials of 330 and 110 mV to reach a current density of 100 and 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER and HER in 1.0 m KOH, respectively. Moreover, an overall water-splitting device comprising this electrode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.48 V. Our finding introduces a new way to design advanced bifunctional catalysts for water splitting.									479	20	0	0	16	0	482			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000407048800024	28598013

In that field, all-solid-state thin-film flexible supercapacitor (ASSTFS) has been considered as a favorable and competitive candidate owing to its multiple benefits such as ultrathin configuration, good flexibility and high safety against liquid leakage. Currently, the major drawback of ASSTFSs is their relatively low capacitance due to the intrinsic supercapacitive behavior of the electrode materials as well as the limited surface area. In this study, ultrathin structure was introduced into spinel ZnCo2O4 through a topological transformation route. The obtained ZnCo2O4 ultrathin nanosheet serves large specific surface area, and thus shortens the ion diffusion distance, leading to the exposure of more electrochemically active area to achieve a much higher pseudocapacitance as in ASSTFS. When assembled into a flexible supercapacitor, the device exhibits a high specific capacitance of 5100 mu F/cm(2) and a high energy density of 31.8 mWh/cm(3) at power density of 280 mW/cm(3). Furthermore, attributed to the beneficial ultrathin structure, the ZnCo2O4 ultrathin nanosheets also demonstrated the superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performances, all of which demonstrating it a promising candidate for energy conversion and storage applications.

J	Feyziev, YM; Yoneda, D; Yoshii, T; Katsuta, N; Kawamori, A; Watanabe, Y								Formate-induced inhibition of the water-oxidizing complex of photosystem II studied by EPR								BIOCHEMISTRY				39	13			3848	3855		10.1021/bi992479h				APR 4 2000	2000	The effects of various formate concentrations on both the donor and the acceptor sides in oxygen-evolving PS II membranes (BBY particles) were examined. EPR, oxygen evolution and variable chlorophyll fluorescence have been observed. It was found that formate inhibits the formation of the S-2 state multiline signal concomitant with stimulation of the Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) signal at g = 1.82. The decrease and the increase in intensities of the multiline and Q(A)(-)Fe(2+) signals, respectively, had a linear relation for formate concentrations between 5 and 500 mM. The g = 4.1 signal formation measured in the absence of methanol was not inhibited by formate up to 250 mM in the buffer. In the presence of 3% methanol the g = 4.1 signal evolved as formate concentration increased. The evolved signal could be ascribed to the inhibited centers. Oxygen evolution measured in the presence of an electron acceptor, phenyl-p-benzoquinone, was also inhibited by formate proportionally to the decrease in the multiline signal intensity. The inhibition seemed to be due to a retarded electron transfer from the water-oxidizing complex to Y-z(+) which was observed in the decay kinetics of the Y-z(+) signal induced by illumination above 250 K. These results show that formate induces inhibition of water oxidation reactions as well as electron transfer on the PS II acceptor side. The inhibition effects of formate in PS II were found to be reversible, indicating no destructive effect on the reaction center induced by formate.									21	0	0	0	19	0	22			0006-2960			WOS:000086194800038	10736186

Here, we report a controllable Fe-doping strategy to promote OER/ORR catalytic performance of Ni(OH)(2). The results reveal that Ni1-xFex (x=0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25) hydroxide nanosheets (NSs) display a volcano-like OER performance, with Ni0.8Fe0.2 NSs being the most optimal OER catalyst, showing an overpotential of 250 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) and excellent stability in 1 M KOH. Compared with pristine Ni(OH)(2) NSs, the enhanced OER/ORR performance of Ni0.8Fe0.2 NSs can be attributed to the much more exposed edge sites and oxygen vacancies. Importantly, the rechargeable ZABs built by Ni0.8Fe0.2 NSs can offer excellent charge-discharge cycling stability not only under 25 degrees C, but also both the low temperature (-10 degrees C) and high temperature (40 degrees C). The work provide a new way to design highly efficient air-electrode catalysts with broad working temperature.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000494229000001

The practical performance of water splitting is highly dependent on the efficiency of electrocatalysts, which can promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Downsizing the metal nanostructures to atomic level to construct single-atom catalysts (SACs) has attracted enormous attention due to its distinct advantages in maximizing the efficiency of metal atom utilization and enhancing activity over corresponding metal nanoparticles. Research on SACs towards electrochemical water splitting application is an emerging field and intensive investigations have been focused on their rational syntheses and applications in HER/OER. In this review, we focus on the wet chemical method developed to prepare non-noble metal based SACs with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies and structure-activity relationship between single metal atoms and catalytic activity. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities for application of single-atom catalysts in water splitting are briefly addressed.

Nevertheless, the main bottleneck restricting the development of these batteries is the need for suitable catalysts to facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we attempt to modify the catalytic performance of delta-MnO2 for lithium- and sodium-oxygen batteries (LOBs and SOBs) by constructing 1,4-benzenedisulfonic acid, 2-chloro-1,4-benzenedisulfonic acid, and 2-fluoro-1,4-benzenedisulfonic acid pillared structures (H-, Cl-, and F-MnO2). Their dynamic stability and catalytic mechanism have been explored by employing density functional theory (DFT). H-MnO2 possesses a theoretical discharge voltage of 2.645 V for LOBs, which is 0.293 V larger than that of Cl-MnO2. The discharge voltage of Cl-MnO2 for SOBs is 3.152 V; however, H-MnO2 impedes the formation of sodium superoxide and can hardly promote the ORR in SOBs. Both H- and Cl-MnO2 can prevent the parasitic disproportionation reaction in LOBs and SOBs that produce active singlet oxygen through different reaction mechanisms. We believe that the constructed pillared structures are efficient ORR/OER catalysts for alkali-metal-oxygen batteries. Our research provides a theoretical basis for the micro-level mechanism of LOBs and SOBs catalyzed by the pillared delta-MnO2 and sheds light on ameliorating the properties of the catalyst by constructing pillared structures.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000728814600001	34877961

While ultrafine oxides have been reported as efficient electrocatalysts for the ORR and OER, there are no reports on ultrafine oxides based on the group 4 or 5 metals as a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. Herein, we present and demonstrate N-doped NbOx/CB nanoparticles as a highly active and stable, bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst in alkaline media. The NbOx nanoparticles approximately 3 nm in size were successfully synthesized on carbon black (CB) by potentiostatic electrodeposition. The employment of a CB support with a large surface area resulted in a loading amount of 20 wt% Nb in the N-doped NbOx/CB and a uniform distribution of the oxide on CB, leading to an increase of the reaction site. The subsequent annealing in an NH3 flow decreased the concentration of oxygen and intercalated a small amount of nitrogen in the as-deposited NbOx particles, largely lowering the overpotentials of the ORR and OER. The surface Nb species on the N-doped NbOx particles were made of multivalent Nb4+ and Nb5+. As a result, the prepared N-doped NbOx/CB nanoparticles exhibited high catalytic activities for both the ORR and OER in a 0.1 M KOH solution. The potential difference, Delta E, indicating an index for the bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst, was 1.13 V, which was comparable to those of the commercial 20 wt% Pt/CB and Ir/CB. In addition, the current densities obtained for the nanoparticles were significantly steady for both the long-term ORR and OER in alkaline media. Together these results demonstrate the N-doped NbOx/CB nanoparticles as potential bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000802018100001

To develop noble metal alternatives for catalysis, non-noble metal compounds have been tremendously pursued but remain non-ideal to issues relating to stability and population of the number of exposed active sites. Inspired by Engel-Brewer valence bond theory, strongly coupled nickel-cobalt-nitride solid-solution/carbon nanotube hybrids were developed by tuning their bifunctionalities from an atomistic scale. The as-synthesized catalysts demonstrate superior catalytic properties to commercial noble-metal based counterparts, i.e. platinum on a carbon support for ORR and iridium oxide for OER, also with much enhanced stability. First-principle calculations and structural analysis show that the optimized structures potentially possess multiple active sites, both bulk-surface response and separated surface charge distribution from optimization of Ni/Co nitrides could contribute to synergistic effects for improved catalytic performances. This study provides not only unique theoretical insights but also a design concept for producing effective bi-functional catalysts with balanced-ORR/OER active sites for this class of transition metal nitride hybrid system and paves the way for exploring other metal nitrides for similar purposes.									23	3	0	0	2	0	23			2405-8297			WOS:000449521500041

In particular, polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) could benefit from a reduction in the size of the iridium oxide (IrOx) particles used to electrocatalyze the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To verify the validity of this approach, we built a library of 18 supported and unsupported IrOx catalysts and established their stability number (S-number) values using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and electrochemistry. Our results provide quantitative evidence that (i) supported IrOx nanocatalysts are more active toward the OER but less stable than unsupported micrometer-sized catalysts, for example, commercial IrO2 or porous IrOx microparticles; (ii) tantalum-doped tin oxides (TaTO) used as supports for IrOx nanoparticles are more stable than antimony-doped tin oxides (ATO) and carbon black (Vulcan XC72); (iii) thermal annealing under air atmosphere yields depreciated OER activity but enhanced stability; (iv) the beneficial effect of thermal annealing holds both for micro- and nano-IrOx particles and leads to 1 order of magnitude lower Ir atom dissolution rate with respect to nonannealed catalysts; (v) the best compromise between OER activity and stability was obtained for unsupported porous IrOx microparticles after thermal annealing under air at 450 degrees C. These insights provide guidance on which material classes and strategies are the most likely to increase sustainably the OER efficiency while contributing to diminish the cost of PEMWE devices.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			2155-5435			WOS:000637003700031

Though metal oxides are envisioned as the potential contenders in this quest due to their high redox potential, nevertheless their low conductivity and instability are among the formidable challenges that need to be addressed. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis and electrochemical applications of covalently linked ultrasmall Ni/NiO NCs (about similar to 2 nm) with the exfoliated thiol-functionalized graphene (G-SH) nanosheets as a highly efficient and durable electrocatalyst for OER. Ni/NiO@G-SH nanohybrid showed a very sharp onset potential of 1.46 V, Tafel slope of 46 mV/dec, turnover frequency (TOF) of 245 s(-1) @1.72 V and a steady-state current response at 10 mA/cm(2) for more than 3 days in 0.1 M KOH solution. We believe that the active redox couple of Ni2+/3+ in nanoscale Ni/NiO at equilibrium fluctuates periodically for the expected sustained OER process. Moreover, the synergistic effect between NCs-GO-SH nanosheets together with the slightly reducing environment due to the strong electron donor thiol groups facilitate the dynamics of the released O-2 as a final product and thus encourage the recycling potential of such nanohybrid materials at low anodic bias.									47	0	0	0	0	0	47			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900047

The electrochemical surface characteristics of nanoparticles and bulk materials were studied by surface-sensitive cyclic voltammetry. Although basically similar voltammetric features were observed for nanoparticles and bulk materials of each metal, some differences were uncovered highlighting the changes in oxidation chemistry. On the basis of the electrochemical results, we demonstrated that Ru nanoparticles show lower passivation potentials compared to bulk Ru material. Ir nanoparticles completely lost their voltammetric metallic features during the voltage cycling, in contrast to the corresponding bulk material. Finally, Pt nanoparticles show an increased oxophilic nature compared to bulk Pt. With regard to the OER performance, the most pronounced effects of nanoscaling were identified for Ru and Pt catalysts. In particular, the Ru nanoparticles suffered from strong corrosion at applied OER potentials and were therefore unable to sustain the OER. The Pt nanoparticles exhibited a lower OER activity from the beginning on and were completely deactivated during the applied OER stability protocol, in contrast to the corresponding bulk Pt catalyst. We highlight that the OER activity and durability were comparable for Ir nanoparticles and bulk materials. Thus, Ir nanoparticles provide a high potential as nanoscaled OER catalyst.									1593	58	0	0	77	0	1609			2155-5435			WOS:000307257800027

The nanocubes possess high crystalline quality. Their band gaps decrease gradually beyond the quantum confinement regime from 3.57 eV to 3.45 eV with increasing particle sizes. The 9 nm CeO2 nanocubes have the most positive valence band energy and correspondingly they exhibit the best electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction activity. Since band gaps of semiconductor nanocrystals can be tuned substantially through particle size control to yield different band energies, this fact can be utilized to enhance the electrochemical and photocatalytic properties.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000704926300001	34617544

Herein, Mg doped perovskite LaNiO3 (LNO) nanofibers (LNMO NFs) were prepared by a facile electrospinning method combined with subsequent calcination. LNMO NFs show a more positive half-wave potential of 0.69 V and a lower overpotential of 0.45 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) than those of the pristine LNO NFs. As an air electrode for zinc-air battery, the cell with LaNi0.85Mg0.15O3 NFs catalyst is able to deliver a high specific capacity of 809.9 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2). It also shows an excellent cycling stability over 110 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). DFT calculation results demonstrate that the LNMO surface binds oxygen stronger than LNO, which contributes to enhanced OER activity as observed in our experiments. The results indicate that LNMO NFs are an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for zinc-air batteries.									68	9	0	0	2	0	69			2574-0962			WOS:000458706900111

ELECTRON IRRADIATION OF CARBON DISULFIDE-OXYGEN ICES: TOWARD THE FORMATION OF SULFUR-BEARING MOLECULES IN INTERSTELLAR ICES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				773	2					184	10.1088/0004-637X/773/2/184				AUG 20 2013	2013	The formation of sulfur-bearing molecules in interstellar ices was investigated during the irradiation of carbon disulfide (CS2)-oxygen (O-2) ices with energetic electrons at 12 K. The irradiation-induced chemical processing of these ices was monitored online and in situ via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to probe the newly formed products quantitatively. The sulfur-bearing molecules produced during the irradiation were sulfur dioxide (SO2), sulfur trioxide (SO3), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS). Formations of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O-3) were observed as well. To fit the temporal evolution of the newly formed products and to elucidate the underlying reaction pathways, kinetic reaction schemes were developed and numerical sets of rate constants were derived. Our studies suggest that carbon disulfide (CS2) can be easily transformed to carbonyl sulfide (OCS) via reactions with suprathermal atomic oxygen (O), which can be released from oxygen-containing precursors such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and/or methanol (CH3OH) upon interaction with ionizing radiation. This investigation corroborates that carbonyl sulfide (OCS) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are the dominant sulfur-bearing molecules in interstellar ices.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000323426100103

Artificial systems are being developed in order to mimic natural photosynthesis and directly harvest and convert solar energy into renewable energy and environmental remediation. Despite significant efforts, it has not been possible to design a single material which has sufficient efficiency, stability and low cost. To integrate the desired characteristics into a single component, heterogeneous photocatalysts are designed with multiple functional components which could combine the advantages of different components to overcome the drawbacks of single component photocatalysts. The present highlight gives a concise overview of heterogeneous catalysts that have been developed and studied in our group and some excellent works of others in recent years. The review focuses on the principles of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic activities followed by some key examples of oxide-based materials. This includes a wide range of structural modification and crystal growth processes leading to composites, heterostructures, including insulator/semiconductor, semiconductor/semiconductor, and multi-heteronanostructures, and core-shell nanostructures which have been modified in order to improve the performance by increasing the light absorption, promoting the charge separation and transportation, and enhancing the redox catalytic activity and intrinsic electrocatalytic properties. The electrochemical processes like hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been discussed closely on the effects of size, shape, exposed facets and surface area of electrocatalysts (metal oxides).									47	1	0	0	2	0	48			1466-8033			WOS:000365408100001

Herein, highly efficient and active photo-/electrochemical catalysts, that is, CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 hybrids, have been synthesized successfully through a facile in situ co-precipitation method at room temperature. The CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 composite exhibits an obvious OER electrocatalytic performance with a current density of 40mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 350mV for water oxidation, which is 2.5times higher than pure CoMn-LDH nanosheets. For HER, CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 ((50)=-448mV) requires a potential close to Pt/C ((50)=-416mV) to reach a current density of 50mAcm(2). Furthermore, under visible-light irradiation, the photocurrent density of the CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 composite is 0.227mAcm(-2), which is 2.1 and 3.8time higher than pristine CoMn-LDH (0.108mAcm(-2)) and g-C3N4 (0.061mAcm(-2)), respectively. The CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 composite delivers a current density of 10mAcm(-2) at 1.56V and 100mAcm(-2) at 1.82V for the overall water-splitting reaction. Therefore, this work establishes the first example of pure CoMn-LDH and CoMn-LDH@g-C3N4 hybrids as electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water-splitting systems for both OER and HER, which may open a pathway to develop and explore other LDH and g-C3N4 nanosheets as efficient catalysts for renewable energy applications.									101	3	0	0	13	0	101			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000430168800025	29431289

This technology has the potential to provide power to portable devices, transportation and stationary sectors. The bifunctional oxygen electrode plays a central role in catalytic activity and stability due to its slow kinetics under extremely oxidizing or reducing environments. With the aim to solve the principal catalytic problems at the bifunctional electrocatalysts, carbonaceous materials including carbon nanofibers (CNFs), graphitized mesoporous carbon (gCMK-3) and hydrazine-reduced graphene oxide (H-rGO) were synthesized, characterized and tested toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and compared to commercial carbon black (Vulcan), graphite, and glassy carbon (GC). Physicochemical characterization was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), elemental analysis and Raman spectroscopy, meanwhile rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) was employed to determine the electrochemical activity and stability. Main results indicate that CNFs can act as a feasible catalyst for URFC applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000542610400014		
J	Vladimir, K.I.; Anatoliy, S.B.								The kinetics of cathodic process of hydrogen evolution on cobalt disilicide anodically oxidized in 0.5 m H2SO4 at high potentials								Condensed Matter and Interphases				20	2			229	30		10.17308/kcmf.2018.20/514				2018	2018	The effect of the anodic oxidation of CoSi2 electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4 at the potentials of oxide formation Ef from 2.0 up to 4.0 V (vs. standard hydrogen electrode) on the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 22degC was studied. The secondary passivation of cobalt silicide occurs at E > 2 V, and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the oxidized electrode surface is possible at E > 2.2 V. Oxide films were formed by potentiostatic polarization for one hour. The cathodic reaction at oxidized silicide was studied in deaerated sulphuric acid solution using polarization and impedance (100 kHz - 0.01 Hz) measurements. At low polarizations, the cathodic polarization curves have rather high slope, then the slope decreases down to 0.09-0.10 V/decade (nearly the same slope was obtained for the non-oxidized electrode), and at sufficiently high polarizations the slope increases again. The current densities for anodically oxidized CoSi2 are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than ones for the non-oxidized electrode. As the capacitance measurements evidenced, each cathodic polarization curve corresponds to approximately constant thickness of oxide film, i.e. the oxide on cobalt disilicide (compositionally close to SiO2) is stable in the cathodic region. The following peculiarities of the cathodic polarization curves for the electrodes oxidized at Ef > 2 V were revealed: (i) the tendency towards increasing the rate of cathodic reaction with Ef; (ii) fairly weak dependence of the kinetics of cathodic reaction on Ef value. The experimental results were explained on the assumption that the cathodic process on oxidized silicide occurs at the oxide/solution interface with the participation of electrons tunneling through the oxide film. Fairly weak dependence of the rate of cathodic reaction on Ef suggests that there are several factors acting in opposite directions. Increase in oxide film thickness with Ef is a factor that slows down the electrochemical reaction. Increase in defect concentration in oxide film with E could f be a factor that facilitates the reaction. The occurrence of appreciable amount of point defects in oxide appears to be associated with OER proceeding at high potentials on CoSi2 electrode. According to the present views, the oxygen vacancies play an important role in the OER kinetics, and these defects can serve as intermediate states in tunnel transfer of electrons through the oxide film in the cathodic process. Based on impedance measurements on an anodized CoSi2 electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4, it was concluded that the cathodic hydrogen evolution at sufficiently low electrode potentials occurs via the discharge-recombination mechanism with the limiting discharge step (electron transfer to protonated silanol groups equivSi-OH2+ on the surface of the oxide film). The values of the rate constants of the HER steps were estimated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1606-867X			INSPEC:18010587

Studies of the response of benthic communities to low-oxygen conditions have previously been restricted to sediment infauna, and have reported mass mortalities during sudden oxygen depletion (2-4) and low species diversity during sustained oxygen deficiencies(5,6). The deep epibenthic fauna of a 220-m deep fjord in British Columbia experiences annual conditions of low oxygen (<1.0 ml I-(1)). I have observed the reactions of the attached fauna to the changing oxygen levels during numerous dives in the submersible Pisces IV over 10 months, and report here that, despite records of the decimation of benthic invertebrate populations(2-5,7-9), this deep-water assemblage maintains a higher diversity and animal abundance than does much of the upper photic zone. The tolerance developed by this community for a wide range of oxygen conditions, including periods of anoxia, has interesting implications for physiology, behaviour and community evolution.									77	4	0	0	59	0	81			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000204440900040

Transition metal layered hydroxides belonging to the brucite-type structure family have been shown to display remarkable electrochemical activity. Recent studies on the earth-abundant Fe3+ containing mossbauerite and Fe3+ rich Co-Fe layered oxyhydroxide carbonates have suggested that grafted interlayer anions might play a key role in OER catalysis. To probe the effect of such interlayer anion grafting in brucite-like layered hydroxides, we report here a systematic study on the electrocatalytic performance of three distinct Ni and Co brucite-type layered structures, namely, (i) brucite-type M(OH)(2) without any interlayer anions, (ii) LDHs with free interlayer anions, and (iii) hydroxynitrate salts with grafted interlayer anions. The electrochemical results indeed show that grafting has an evident impact on the electronic structure and the observed OER activity. Ni- and Co-hydroxynitrate salts with grafted anions display notably earlier formations of the electrocatalytically active species. Particularly Co-hydroxynitrate salts exhibit lower overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta=0.34 V) and medium current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) (eta=0.40 V) compared to the corresponding brucite-type hydroxides and LDH materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000673350300001	34138493

Here, an in-situ intercalation method is demonstrated to expand the inter-layer spacing of electrodeposited NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH) electrodes. Compared with traditional electrode fabrication method, in which intercalation/exfoliation of LDH powders is performed first followed by coating it on substrate, better interface connection and stability are maintained in the present method. It is found that the inter-layer distance of NiFe LDH material can be increased from 7.8 to 9.5 angstrom by immersing the electrode in formamide at 80 C-circle for 3 h, and the required overpotential of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for sustaining 10 mA cm(-2) current density is reduced from 256 to 210 mV. Moreover, with the assistance of ultrasound treatment, the required intercalation time is reduced drastically and the overpotential@10 mA cm(-2) current density is further decreased to 203 mV.

In this study, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systemically investigate 2D transition metal based tetracyanoquinodimethane (TM-TCNQ TM = Cr-Cu, Ru-Ag, Pt, Ir) monolayers with single TM atoms catalysts (SACS) distributed periodically with high density. We calculate a lower limiting overpotential of eta(lim) = 0.33 V for Fe-TCNQ yielding a higher expected activity than that of Pt metal (0.48 V) for the ORR under acidic conditions. The catalytic performance of Fe-TCNQ for OER is, however, surpassed by Ni-TCNQs (eta(lim) = 0.46 V), which is identified as the highest among the candidates. By applying grafting axial ligands and external strain, the adsorption strength of reaction intermediates on TM reactive sites can be further optimized and enhances the activities of Mn-, Fe- and Ni-TCNQs for the ORR or the OER. Here, Fe-TCNQ-CI (eta(lim) = 0.27/0.55 V), followed by Fe-TCNQ-CO (eta(lim) = 0.67/0.43 V), are predicted as novel, high-performance bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts with comparable limiting overpotentials to those of the best commercially used electrocatalysts, Pt (ORR: eta(lim) = 0.48 V) and RuO2 (OER: eta(lim) = 0.42 V). In addition, the recently synthesized Fe-TCNQ possess excellent conductivity with fast electron transfer during the catalytic reactions.

Despite many efforts made to understand the fundamental Li-O-2 electrochemistry, the kinetic process of cathodic reactions, associated with the formation and decomposition of a solid Li2O2 phase during charging and discharging, remains debate. Here we report direct visualization of the charge/discharge reactions on a gold cathode in a non-aqueous lithium-oxygen micro-battery using liquid-cell aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combining with synchronized electrochemical measurements. The real-time and real-space characterization by time-resolved STEM reveals the electrochemical correspondence of discharge/charge overpotentials to the nucleation, growth and decomposition of Li2O2 at a constant current density. The nano-scale operando observations would enrich our knowledge on the underlying reaction mechanisms of lithium-oxygen batteries during round-trip discharging and charging and shed lights on the strategies in improving the performances of lithium-oxygen batteries by tailoring the cathodic reactions.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2045-2322			WOS:000425284900002	29453422

Herein, an elaborate design on a highly catalytic LOBs cathode constructed by N-doped carbon nanotubes (CNT) with in situ encapsulated Co2P and Ru nanoparticles is reported. The homogeneously dispersed Co2P and Ru catalysts can effectively modulate the formation and decomposition behavior of Li2O2 during discharge/charge processes, ameliorating the electronically insulating property of Li2O2 and constructing a homogenous low-impedance Li2O2/catalyst interface. Compared with Co/CNT and Ru/CNT electrodes, the Co2P/Ru/CNT electrode delivers much higher oxygen reduction triggering onset potential and higher ORR and OER peak current and integral areas, showing greatly improved ORR/OER kinetics due to the synergistic effects of Co2P and Ru. Li-O-2 cells based on the Ru/Co2P/CNT electrode demonstrate improved ORR/OER overpotential of 0.75 V, excellent rate capability of 12 800 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), and superior cycle stability for more than 185 cycles under a restricted capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1). This work paves an exciting avenue for the design and construction of bifunctional catalytic cathodes by coupling metal phosphides with other active components in LOBs.									66	3	0	0	2	1	67			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000477680900003	31074926

Experimental data and theoretical calcinations demonstrate that the FeOOH facilitates surface adsorption and cleavage of OH-/H2O species and decrease the d-band center of active Ni species for optimizing the Gibbs free energy of intermediates. Furthermore, relatively vertical Ni3N nanotubes can promote the mass transport and electrons transfer as a main catalyst. The unusual synergistic effect in hybrid system with high density of heterointerface is contributed to the improvement of HER/OER catalytic performance. Specifically, the obtained FeOOH/Ni3N hybrid catalysts display excellent OER/HER performance with an overpotential of 244 mV/67 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, along with an applied potential of 1.58 V to boost overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2). This simple and effective strategy may provide a new path to design the bifunctional catalysts and improve the catalytic performance for water splitting.									83	5	0	0	3	0	84			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000532683200008

Previous heat treatments traded off the activity against the durability. In the present study, we broke this trade-off relation by vacuum heat treatments at low temperatures (40-80 degrees C). The non-treated IrOx electrode using a glass substrate covered with F-doped SnO2 initially yielded a high OER current density at a given applied potential in an electrolyte of near-neutral pH, however, followed by a rapid decrease in the current density because of detachment of the IrOx particles. The vacuum heat treatments up to 80 degrees C significantly suppressed the degradation with maintaining high current densities. SEM observations and XRF analyses confirmed a reduction in the detachment of the IrOx particles. Infrared absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed a decrease in the amount of hydrated water and hydroxyl groups surrounding the IrOx particles with increasing treatment temperature, suggesting the important roles of these species on the inter-particle binding force and OER activity. The IrOx/FTO electrodes vacuum-heat-treated under the optimal condition of 60 degrees C for 6 h exhibited only a slight increase in the applied potential during a chronopotentiometry measurement at a current density of 5 mA cm(-2) over 100 h.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000832812000001

Herein, a heterostructure strategy to construct a CeO2-x decorated CoFe layer double hydroxide (LDH) grown on Ni foam (NF) (denoted as CeO2-x@CoFe LDH/NF) is presented. By constructing the CeO2-x@CoFe LDH heterostructure on NF, the as-prepared CeO2-x@CoFe LDH/NF offers superior electrocatalytic performance for the OER. CoFe LDH as a recognized catalyst provides active sites for OER reactions and CeO2-x nanoparticles bring more oxygen vacancies and synergies with the LDH structure to improve the catalytic performance of the OER. In 1.0 M KOH, it needs an ultralow overpotential of 204 mV to achieve the current density of 100 mA cm(-2), and also shows long term durability for more than 30 hours. Moreover, when subjected to simulated alkaline seawater (1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl), CeO2-x@CoFe LDH/NF still maintains the high activity and durability for the OER without being affected by chloride species. This work will provide a guideline for designing heterostructures of nanoparticles and LDH to drive efficient water oxidation reactions in the future.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2052-1553			WOS:000587892200014

PDDA plays an important role in homogeneously increasing the surface density of available functional groups, which can provide active sites for decoration of CoMn2O4 on CNTs. In addition, PDDA preserves the intrinsic properties of CNTs, increases the active sites of catalysts, and enhances the durability of the catalysts. Here, CoMn2O4 nanocrystals were uniformly deposited on PDDA-CNTs with loading amounts from 36% to 83%. The as-prepared CoMn2O4/PDDA-CNT catalyst showed high current densities for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and neutral conditions, which outperformed the Co3O4/PDDA-CNT and Pt/C catalysts at medium overpotential, mainly through a 4e reduction pathway. The obtained CoMn2O4/PDDA-CNT hybrid exhibited excellent activity and durability when subjected to an oxygen evolution reaction. These results indicate that the CoMn2O4/PDDA-CNT hybrid represents a promising alternative to Pt for ORR electrocatalysis, and this non-precious bifunctional electrocatalyst provides a corrosion resistant and protective cathode layer to fuel cells. The excellent activity and stability of the hybrid materials demonstrate the potential of noncovalent coupling inorganic/carbon composites as novel catalytic systems for lithium-air batteries and chlor-alkali production.

Today's energy deficient world has been seeking for an electrocatalyst which has a simple and facile synthesis strategy with marvellous catalytic performance and has outstandingly sustained stability for the highly lethargic Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Here, a Ni-based mixed linker Metal Organic Framework (MOF) was synthesized using 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid (BTC) and 4,4'-bipyridine (bpy) as organic linkers. Carbon Dots (CDs) were incorporated into MOF during synthesis to impart synergistic effect to the as-synthesized composite. All the synthesized samples i.e CDs, MOF and CDs@MOF were characterized by various techniques to confirm the structural, compositional, morphological and textural analysis. The synthesized composite possessed rods like morphology with uniform distribution of CDs which offered superb stability for almost 40 hrs, large electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), least charge transfer resistance (R-ct), high turnover frequency (TOF), reasonably low onset potential, low overpotential and a comparably low Tafel slope. The electrocatalyst owed its great catalytic efficiency and substantial stability due to the synergistic effect between CDs and MOF. This work is an effort to exploit the fabulous potential of MOF based nano-composite towards water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

But the high price and scarcity of these catalysts impede their large-scale applications. Ni-based materials are considered to be the most suitable catalytic materials to substitute these noble metal materials. In this paper, the monodispersed alpha-Ni(OH)(2) microspheres assembled by ultrathin nanosheets were synthesized by a facile solvothermal method. This method was surfactant-free and no precipitator was used. The as-obtained products were well-characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results of N-2 adsorption/desorption isotherm indicate that the BET surface area of the products was 169.94 m(2)g(-1), and the pore-size distribution centered at 3.5 nm. Then, the electrochemical properties were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (ASV) in 1 M KOH. At a current density of 10 mA cm(2), the overpotential for the alpha-Ni(OH)(2)-MS is 320 mV, and the Tafel slope is 98.7 mV dec(-1), indicating its excellent reaction kinetics for an efficient catalyst toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2296-8016			WOS:000470088900001		
P	LAW C G; FEDKIW P S; HICKS M T								Preparation of organic compounds involves Kolbe electrolysis utilizing polymer electrolyte membrane reactor					US6238543-B1	DU PONT DE NEMOURS&CO E I; UNIV NORTH CAROLINA																			NOVELTY - An organic compound is prepared by utilizing a polymer electrolyte membrane reactor via Kolbe electrolysis. The reactor design uses gaseous or neat liquid reactants without the use of organic co-solvents, prevents the loss of platinum, and permits the use of oxygen reduction to water as the cathode reaction. USE - For preparing organic compounds. ADVANTAGE - The reactor uses a two-sided catalyst coated Nafion 117 (RTM) polymer electrolytic membrane (PEM) simultaneously as the electrolyte and separator, this manner eliminates the need for an additional electrolyte, aqueous solvent, and organic co-solvent. Since gas may be fed directly to the anode and/or cathode, solubilized platinum, formed by oxidation of the anode, is not dissolved or lost in a liquid electrolyte but remain confined within the PEM. Oxygen reduction to water may be used as the cathode reaction. In this manner, energy consumption is less, if the reduction of protons to hydrogen is used as the cathode reaction, and the water by product may be used to hydrate the PEM. The hazards associated with hydrogen evolution at the cathode are eliminated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preparation of an organic compound of structure (RCH2--CH2R') (II) from carboxylic acid(s) of structures (RCH2COOH) (I) and (R'CH2COOH) (I') comprises:(a) introducing (I) and (I') in the vapor state or as neat organic liquids in the absence of an organic solvent to the anode side of a polymer electrode membrane reactor;(b) supplying, concurrently, an oxygen carrying gas to the cathode side of the reactor;(c) passing equivalent(s) of electrical current through the polymer electrode membrane reactor resulting in the formation of the compound (II) on the anode side of the reactor and the formation of water on the cathode side of the reactor; and(d) isolating the compound (II) from the anode side effluent from the polymer electrode membrane reactor.The organic compound was prepared by reacting compounds (I) and (I') based on the equation, (RCH2COOH + R'CH2COOH + 1divide2O2 to RCH2-CH2R' + 2CO2 + H2O).R and R' = H, 1-6C alkyl, substituted alkyl, optionally substituted phenyl, aralkyl, or ring-substituted aralkyl.															0						DIIDW:2001450120

The non-precious metal catalysts exhibit a great promise for high electrocatalytic activity. Herein, we develop a simple strategy to prepare a porous atomically dispersed Fe doped ZIF-8-derived nanocatalyst supported on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The optimal Fe-N-C/2rGO catalyst with a sandwich-like structure is constructed by a uniform Fe-doped ZIF-8 carbon particle layer covering the rGO surface, which demonstrates an excellent performance for ORR with a half-wave potential E-1/2 of 0.88 V vs. RHE and OER with a voltage of 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2), compared with that of commercial Pt/C (E-1/2 = 0.86 V) and IrO2 (1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) in 0.1 M KOH, respectively. The ingenious construction prevents the Fe-doped ZIF-8 particles and rGO from the agglomeration. It enables a rechargeable Zn-air battery with a high peak power density of 164 mW cm(-2) and excellent cycling stability. This approach provides a convenient path for constructing and designing highly active catalysts for the Zn-air batteries.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000680877800001

Here, porous bimetallic oxide and chalcogenide nanosheets grown on carbon paper denoted as NiCo2X4/CP (X = O, S, and Se) are prepared to demonstrate how the anion components affect the electronic structures and thereby disclose the correlation between their intermediates interaction and catalytic activities. The experimental characterization and theoretical calculation demonstrate that Se and S substitution can promote the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ and thereby modulate the electronic structure accompanied with the upshift of d band centers, which not only enhance the inner conductivity but also regulate the interaction between the catalyst surface and intermediates, especially for the adsorption of absorbed H and hydroperoxy intermediates towards respective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, a full alkaline electrolyzer using NiCo2Se4/CP and NiCo2S4/CP as cathode and anode delivers a low voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mAcm(-2), which is comparable even superior to most transition metal-based electrolyzers.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000631787700004

Herein, to improve their catalytic performance, we have synthesized a boron-doped CNT (BC3NT) with varying boron contents. The Raman spectrum proves that the more defects are due to the higher boron content. And HLABs based on BC3NT show great cyclability and catalytic performance in air, with an overpotential value of 0.3 V for 200 hours at a current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, theoretical calculations with density functional theory (DFT) confirm the effects of topological defects of BC3NT on the ORR and OER. Since boron is doped into the CNT, BC3NT containing a large amount of defect rings is obtained. And the generation of defects was conducive to the battery reaction. Accordingly, as a positive electrode material for HLABs, BC3NT is more conducive to the ORR and OER, and the topological defect ring generated by it improved the ORR and OER performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000725114800001

The synergistic effect of dual heteroatom doping provides additional degrees of freedom to achieve higher ORR efficiency through decreased energy barriers of the intermediates in catalytic processes. Herein, Fe-SAs anchored within the N, S co-doped porous nanosized carbonaceous spheres (Fe-SAs@N/S-PCSs) was fabricated through the py-rolysis of anchored heteroatom sources and ferric precursors. Under the low catalyst loading capacity of 0.255 mg cm(-2), the obtained Fe-SAs@N/S-PCSs exhibits exceptionally high performance with ORR onset potential (E-onset) of 1.02 V, and half wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.90 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH solution, outperforming benchmark Pt/C (E-onset = 1.01 V, E-1/2 = 0.86 V). Superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (450 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) is also demonstrated, thus displaying outstanding performance for Zn-air battery. The porous structure, rich accessible Fe SAs, and the optimal binding of ORR-related species induced by S doping in carbon matrix generate the excellent ORR activity and durability.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry (CV) all confirm the successful modification of the ITO surface. When used to catalyze the water oxidation reaction, the most active electrode (ITO-Ben-IrO x) with the surface coverage of Ir at 3.96 x10(-9) mol cm(-2) (estimated by CV) exhibits 194 mV onset overpotentials and 249 mV overpotentials to reach 1 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M HClO4. The turn-over frequency (TOF) for oxygen evolution at 280 mV overpotentials is 1.33 s(-1). The electron transfer kinetics of a series of electrodes are investigated, and the results suggest that the electron transfer rate from the electrode substrate to the catalyst does not limit the rate of the water oxidation reaction at low overpotentials, and that the bridging molecules with resonant structures are desirable to enhance the TOF of the water oxidation reaction.

This report describes findings of an investigation of the synthesis of gold cobalt (AuCo) nanoparticles by a facile one-pot and injection method and their use as highly efficient catalysts for OER. While particle size depends on the synthesis method, the composition of the nanoparticles is controlled by feeding ratio of Au and Co precursors in the synthesis. Depending on Co content, the nanoparticles exhibit largely phase-segregated domains with a core (Au)-shell (Co) type of structure at a high level of Co. Upon the thermochemical treatment of carbon-supported AuCo nanoparticles, the redox activity of Co species in the nanoparticles with cycle number is shown to decrease which changes the surface oxidation state of Co species without changing the composition significantly. The electrocatalytic activity for OER in alkaline electrolytes is shown to depend on the bimetallic composition, displaying a maximum activity for an Au:Co ratio of similar to 2:3. This dependence is also shown to correlate with the surface oxidation state and redox activities, providing an insight into the electrocatalytic activity. Mechanistic aspects of the electrocataltytic properties are discussed in terms of the bifunctional synergy of Co and Au in the nanoparticle catalysts.									30	1	0	0	0	0	31			1944-8244			WOS:000381331600029	27479685

Herein we report a simple one-step method to generate a low cost copper oxide catalyst film in situ from a copper(II) ethylenediamine complex. The resulting catalyst has excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline solutions. A catalytic current density of 1.0 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2) for the catalyst film requires the overpotentials of only similar to 370 mV and similar to 475 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. This catalytic performance shows that the new catalyst is one of the best Cu-based heterogeneous OER catalysts to date.									56	1	0	0	4	0	57			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000374035800010	27020763

In order to improve OER performance, MOFs are usually used as precursors to prepare metal oxide/porous carbon composites by pyrolysis at high temperatures in previous studies. Although metal oxide/porous carbon composites show high catalytic activity, they require complicated preparation processes and high temperature. Therefore, it is very significant to find a highly efficient MOFs, which can be directly used as OER without pyrolysis treatment. The results show that when Co-ZIF-67/NF, Ni-MOF-74/NF and Fe-MIL-101/NF are used as OER catalysts in 1 mol/L KOH solution, 377, 383 and 272 mV overpotentials are required to make the current density achieve 10 mA/cm~2. The charge transfer resistance (Rct) of Fe-MIL-101/NF is 1.53 Omega, which is smaller than that of Co-ZIF-67/NF (32.40 Omega) and Ni-MOF-74/NF (43.78 Omega). Therefore, the higher of the Rct of the catalyst, the smaller of the charge transfer capacity in the OER process. Thus, the fast charge transfer rate is the main reason for the excellent OER activity of Fe-MIL-101/NF. In addition, the OER activity of Fe-MIL-101/NF (272 mV) without pyrolysis treatment is much higher than that of commercial RuO_2/NF (302 mV), indicating that MOFs with fast charge transfer rate can be used as an efficient catalyst for OER without calcination.			近年来,金属有机骨架(MOFs)逐渐用于析氧反应(OER)领域。在以往研究中,MOFs通常作为前驱体在高温下热解制备金属氧化物/多孔碳复合材料以提高OER性能。虽然金属氧化物/多孔碳复合材料显示出较高的催化活性,但是它们需要复杂的制备工艺和高温条件。因此,寻找一种不经过热解处理可以直接用作OER的高效能MOFs催化剂是有意义的。结果表明,以Co-ZIF-67/NF、Ni-MOF-74/NF和Fe-MIL-101/NF为OER的催化剂时,在1 mol/L KOH溶液中电流密度达到10 mA/cm~2所需过电位分别为377、383和272 mV。Fe-MIL-101/NF的电荷转移电阻(Rct)为1.53 Omega,小于Co-ZIF- 67/NF(32.40 Omega)和Ni-MOF-74/NF(43.78 Omega)。因此,随着催化剂的Rct逐渐增大,OER过程中的电荷传递能力降低,即快速的电荷转移速率是Fe-MIL-101/NF具有优异OER活性的主要原因。另外,不经热解处理的Fe-MIL-101/NF(272 mV)的OER活性明显高于商业RuO_2/NF(302 mV),说明具有快速电荷转移速率的MOFs可以不经煅烧作为OER的高效催化剂。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2409			CSCD:7065864

Herein, we report IrNi nanoparticles uniformly distributed on cost-effective activated carbon support with a low mass loading of 3% by weight to drive the overall water splitting reaction under light illumination over a wide pH range. The prepared IrNi nanomaterials were extensively characterized by SEM/EDX, TEM, XRD, Raman, and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The experimental results demonstrate that when the Ir:Ni ratio is 4:1, the water splitting rate is high at 32 and 25 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen (at -1.16 V) and oxygen evolution reactions (at 1.8 V) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, upon the light irradiation (100 mW cm(-2)). The physical and electrochemical characterization of metal and alloy combinations show that the cumulative effect of relatively high crystallinity (among the materials used in this study), reduced charge recombination rate, and improved oxygen vacancies observed with the 4Ir1Ni@AC electrode is the reason for the superior activity obtained. A high level of durability for hydrogen and oxygen evolution under light illumination is seen in the chronoamperometric study over 15 h of operation. Overall water splitting examined in 0.1 M of NaOH medium at a 50 mV s(-1) scan rate showed a cell voltage of 1.94 Vat a 10 mA cm(-2) current density.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000859538800001

SnO2/Ag hollow spheres can provide not only large surface area for the growth of Co(OH)(2) but also better conductivity and stability derived from Ag. XRD shows the formation of amorphous Co(OH)(2) supported on SnO2/Ag. XPS confirms the existence and valence state of Sn, Ag and Co. EDX and SEM elemental mapping show the composition and good distribution of Sn, O, Ag and Co. SEM and TEM show that the wrinkled Co(OH)(2) nanosheets homogeneously covered on the surface of SnO2/Ag hollow spheres, which implying more exposed active sites. OER measurements show that SnO2/Ag/Co(OH)(2) has the enhanced performances with lower onset potential (1.4 V vs. RHE), smaller Tafel slope (80.04 mV dec(-1)) than SnO2/Co(OH)(2) and unsupported Co(OH)(2). Ag modification may be the key for enhancement performances for OER due to providing faster electron transfer rate. The excellent long-time stability of SnO2/Ag/Co(OH)(2) may be ascribed to the close combination between Co(OH)(2) and SnO2/Ag and stability of Ag in alkaline solution. The suitable support with good dispersion and conductivity can provide a facile way to prepare effective electrocatalysts for OER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1452-3981			WOS:000436261400059

Firstly, Fe0.5Co0.5 nanosheets have been electrodeposited on the surface of CFC. Then, Fe0.5Co0.5/CFC as precursor has been converted to uniform Fe0.5Co0.5Se2 spheres on CFC (Fe0.5Co0.5Se2/CFC) by DMF selenization process. XRD and EDX confirm the typical crystalline structure and homogeneous elemental distribution of Fe0.5Co0.5Se2 on the surface of CFC. XPS shows the existence and valence of Fe, Co and Se. The uniform size and good dispersion of Fe0.5Co0.5Se2 spheres with the diameter of about 100 nm have been revealed by SEM and elemental mapping, which may provide more active sites for OER. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the obtained Fe0.5Co0.5Se2/CFC possesses the better OER activity with smaller overpotential, lower Tafel slope and charge transfer resistance than other samples, which may be ascribed to the uniform spherical morphology and the better intrinsic activity from binary metal Fe0.5Co0.5Se2. Moreover, the faster electron transfer rate derived from CFC support and the synergistic effect between Fe0.5Co0.5Se2 and CFC may be responsible for the enhancements of OER performances.

The geometries and binding energies of molecular and dissociative adsorption are studied as a function of coverage. The simulations reveal that dissociative water adsorption on all the studied low-index surfaces are thermodynamically favorable. Analysis of surface energies suggests that the most preferentially exposed surface is (012). The contribution of surface relaxation to the respective surface energies is significant. Calculations of electron local density of states indicate that the electron-energy band gaps for the four investigated surfaces appears to be less related to the difference in coordinative unsaturation of the surface atoms, but rather to changes in the ionicity of the surface chemical bonds. The electrochemical computation is used to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on -Ga2O3 surfaces. Our results indicate that the (100) and (110) surfaces, which have low stability, are the most favorable ones for HER and OER, respectively.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000337574800014	24753143

However, unreceptive thermodynamics and slothful kinetics of this process mandate the use of a noble metal catalyst. Substituting these noble metals by more abundant transition metals is vital for commercial application of these technologies. In this regard, we have developed a facile method for synthesis of Ni3Fe alloy with bicontinuous structure. The highly porous foam-like structure of the composite electrode offers numerous transportation channels for transfer of electrolyte and dissipation of the gaseous products. Moreover, the formation of a carbon layer during the synthesis of the composite improves the stability of the catalyst by preventing the agglomeration and dissolution of nanoparticles. Consequently, Ni3Fe nanoparticles with bicontinuous structure displayed enhanced catalytic activity for OER and required low over potential only 248 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Excellent activity and long-term durability of theses Ni3Fe nanoparticles make them an ideal substitute for the noble metal catalyst. We believe this work can provide an easy way for the synthesis of highly porous nanoparticles. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We report a highly active and durable iridium electrocatalyst supported on boron carbide for the oxygen evolution reaction. The physical and electrochemical properties of the catalyst are controlled by changing the synthetic reduction temperature from 30 degrees C to 100 degrees C. The prepared Ir/B4C-100 degrees C catalyst shows two times higher mass activity than Ir/(4)C30 degrees C, even outperforming two commercial catalysts. The improved activity can be correlated to the high concentration of Ir (III) and OH species on the surface and the well-dispersed iridium nanoparticles on the support. Controlling the reduction temperature is also found to enhance iridium stability by developing the interactions between iridium and B4C. These metal-support interactions inhibit the oxidative dissolution of Ir (III) and the aggregation of iridium species. Ir/B4C-100 degrees C also shows better single cell performance than those of two commercial catalysts when tested in a PEMWE. The cell with the synthesized catalyst of Ir/B4C-100 degrees C shows a current density of 1.98 A/cm(2) at 1.8 V, whereas those with two commercial catalysts exhibit values of 1.36 and 0.692 A/cm(2) at 1.8 V, respectively.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000701663600005

The feasibility of this new approach was first demonstrated by synthesizing a known covalent organic framework (COF) material, TpPa-1. Then, a novel imine-based COP named BEAB (BEA = bis-(2-ethynylaniline), BEB=bis (2-ethynylbenzaldehyde), BEA+BEB=BEAB) with precisely controlled distribution of nitrogen was prepared using the same method, after which Co, Fe and Ni transition metals were incorporated into the structure to form BEAB-metal complexes, which were then explored as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Among the various BEAB-metal complexes, BEAB-Co exhibited the best OER performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1) with only a small potential difference of 7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) after 10 h of continuous electrolysis, indicating the excellent durability and structural integrity of the complex. These promising properties could be attributed to efficient charge transport on the conductive pi-conjugated polymeric chain, and the abundant N chelating sites on the BEAB. This work provides a facile and fast way to produce a COP in large quantities in an efficient manner, which would greatly benefit the large-scale practical application of these kinds of functional materials.

However, reports to date suggest that it is highly challenging to fabricate such nanoparticle-modified electrodes and usually involves multistep routes of chemical synthesis, purification, and finally, embedment onto the electrode surface, often at very high temperature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a single-step electrochemical preparation and in situ deposition of thin clusters of cobalt nanoparticle onto the electrode surface are being reported. The thickness of the nanoparticle clusters was not uniform and varied between 20 and 90 nm. The cobalt nanoparticles on the dense graphite sheet reported could attain an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current of 10 mA/cm(2) at a very low overpotential of 350 mV despite a very low catalyst loading. The turnover frequency (0.78 s(-1)) and activation energies (21 kJ/mol) for OER indicate that these are potential anode catalysts in the alkaline media-based oxygen evolution reaction. The fabrication methodology of these ready-to-use cobalt-based graphite substrates has several advantages like the use of an environment-friendly medium such as an aqueous deep eutectic solvent mixture, inexpensive graphite sheet, and rapid single-step preparation under ambient room-temperature conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0970			WOS:000526396200062

Herein, we develop a nanoconfined synthesis approach for the fabrication of a metal-free graphitic mesoporous carbon nitride (gMesoCN) electrocatalyst with a high surface area of 406 m(2)/g and high nitrogen content of 48%. This is achieved by a nanohard-templating approach through simple polymerization of guanidine hydrochloride (GndCl) as a single carbon-nitrogen source inside the organized mesopore channels of a mesoporous SBA15 silica nanotemplate. The produced material is characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which confirmed the formation of a well-ordered mesoporous carbon nitride, while analysis of the pore size distribution indicated the formation of uniformly sized pore channels of 4.56 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated that gMesoCN consisted of C and N. The metal-free gMesoCN material showed good electrocatalytic performance for the OER in alkaline medium, where a Tafel slope of 52.4 mV/dec indicated favorable OER kinetics. Significantly, the gMesoCN material demonstrates long-term durability with 98.4% retention of current density after 24 h. The reported gMesoCN material is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and easy-to-synthesize with the potential for applicability in the field of electrocatalysis.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			2574-0962			WOS:000516665300024		
J	Eftekhari, Ali								From pseudocapacitive redox to intermediary adsorption in oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS TODAY CHEMISTRY				4				117	132		10.1016/j.mtchem.2017.03.003				JUN 2017	2017	The mechanism of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is somehow related to that of the pseudocapacitance of metal oxide electrocatalysts in potentials lower than the OER standard potential. Although pseudocapacitance of metal oxide electrocatalysts is usually studied in the investigations of OER, this dependence is not profoundly inspected. During the pseudocapacitive behavior, some high valence cations are formed over a broad range of potential in an underpotential region before the formal redox potential. This is due to the exceptional activities of some sites, which are capable of further oxidation at the OER potential to form active sites for the OER electrocatalysis. Therefore, a well-defined pseudocapacitance is somehow a requirement for the OER performance. Almost all OER electrocatalysts reported in the literature display considerable pseudocapacitive behavior at the lower potentials. The corresponding pseudocapacitance explains the difference between the OER activities of IrO2 and RuO2. Here, the focus is on noble metals as the well-defined OER electrocatalysts, but the reasoning can be extended to other metal oxides. The electrochemical behaviors including the pseudocapacitance of almost all inexpensive OER electrocatalysts such as cobalt oxide, nickel oxide, etc. are similar to that of IrO2 as described here. Moreover, despite the high cost, noble metals still have the practical potentials for OER, subject to further enhancement in the OER efficiency or as additives in inexpensive electrocatalysts.

Unfortunately, their practical utilization is seriously hindered by the limited accessible active sites and inferior activity. Herein, vertically-aligned porous nanoarrays composed of ultrafine nitrogen-doped cobalt oxide (NP-Co3O4) nanoparticles (4-5 nm) are in-situ fabricated on carbon cloth (CC) via mild oxidation of Co-based zeolitic-imidazolate-framework (Co-ZIF) nanoarrays. The oxidation decomposition of 2-methylimidazolate ligands between Co nodes not only confines the growth of cobalt oxides, but also provides the nitrogen sources for realizing low-temperature (200 degrees C) nitrogen doping. In alkaline electrolyte, the as-built NP-Co3O4/CC manifests an extremely high oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half-wave potential of similar to 0.9 V and a decreased oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 330 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), displaying a record low potential gap of 0.66 V. As bifunctional oxygen electrodes in rechargeable aqueous and all-solid-state flexible zinc-air batteries, the NP-Co3O4/CC-based batteries exhibit ultrahigh power densities up to 200 mW cm(-2) and 99.8 mW cm(-3), respectively, which are much higher than those of reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. This work paves a new avenue for the fabrication of porous nitrogen doped metal oxides towards high-performance zinc-air batteries.									57	4	0	0	1	0	58			2405-8297			WOS:000518197900016

Electrochemistry based technologies, e.g., fuel cells, Zn-air batteries or water splitting, are some of the frontrunners of this green energy revolution. The primary concern of such sustainable energy technologies is the efficient conversion and storage of clean energy. Most of these technologies are based on half-cell reactions like oxygen reduction, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, which in turn depend on noble metal based catalysts for their efficient functioning. In order to make such green energy technologies economically viable, the need of the hour is to develop new noble metal free catalysts. Porous carbon, with some assistance from heteroatoms like N or S or earth abundant transition metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, has shown excellent potential in the catalysis of such electrochemical reactions. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) containing metal nodes and organic linkers in an ordered morphology with inherent porosity are ideal self-sacrificial templates for such carbon materials. There has been a recent spurt in reports on such MOF-derived carbon based materials as electrocatalysts. In this review, we have presented some of this research work and also discussed the practical reasons behind choosing MOFs for this purpose. Different approaches for synthesizing such carbonaceous materials with unique morphologies and doping, targeted towards superior electrochemical activity, have been documented in this review.									49	3	0	0	4	0	50				2046-2069		WOS:000445745800035	35541061

This technique overcomes the oxygen consumption of large pulverized coal in the early stages of re-firing during air/flue gas transport of pulverized coal. This study conducted experiments on a planar flame burner bench to analyze the physicochemical structure evolution of coal coke after natural gas and syngas activation using FTIR, XPS, and BET. The NO reduction capacity was tested on a micro fluidized bed reaction test bench. The results show that natural gas's upgrading effect is better than syngas. Hydrogen and hydrocarbon radicals generated by the reaction of natural gas with oxygen play a significant role in activation. After upgrading by natural gas, the specific surface area of carbon increased by about 54.2 %, the total pore volume increased by about 51.2 %, the whole oxygen-containing groups decreased by nearly 4.4 %, the total amount of alkyl complexes increased by about 3.6 %, and the nitric oxide reducing ability increased by almost 75 %. The technology minimizes expensive reactive gases while ensuring less reburned coal is used to reduce NOx emissions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1879-1026		MEDLINE:36063956	36063956

The influence of the initial temperature of the oxidizer T-oxi was analyzed and discussed. It is shown that in order to achieve an effective reaction of ignition the oxidizer temperature needn't be maximized. Detailed evolution of ignition delay time with equivalence ratio tau(ig) was presented. It can be concluded that increment of oxygen concentration z(O2) in oxidizer results in decrease of tau(ig). Trials with propane are characterizing lower values of ignition delay time tau(ig) in comparison with methane.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0334-6455	2191-0324		WOS:000294207300021		
J	Zhao LinWei; Gu TengTeng; Liang ZiWei; Liu Jun								Recent advances in bifunctional catalysts for zinc-air batteries: Synthesis and potential mechanisms								SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES											10.1007/s11431-022-2073-5		JUL 2022			2022	Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) are considered promising candidates for next-generation clean and sustainable energy storage devices because of their low cost, safety, environment-friendliness, and high specific energy density. However, owing to its poor charge-discharge capacity and low efficiency, its practical application remains challenging. The main obstacles are the intrinsic slow reaction kinetics on the air cathode, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during recharging. Therefore, a reasonable design of bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability is the key to the development of ZABs. In this review, the recent advances in bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts as air cathodes in ZABs are discussed from three perspectives: metal-organic framework-based catalysts, metal-free carbon catalysts, and metal-based catalysts. In particular, the synthesis, electrocatalytic activity, and potential mechanism of bifunctional catalysts in ZABs are discussed. In recent years, research on bifunctional catalysts has intensified, and the performance of these catalysts has significantly improved. However, most of the experimental products have complex preparation processes and high costs; therefore, the industrialization of these experimental products remains difficult. This review offers prospects for the optimal design of high-activity rechargeable ZAB bifunctional air cathodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7321	1869-1900		WOS:000824967300001

Here, we study a cathode catalyst based on B- and N-doped and BN codoping on Stone-Wales defect graphene (SWG) by first-principles calculations. Interestingly, BN codoped structure not only increases the stability of the system but also exhibits extremely low discharge and charge overpotentials. The corresponding value of overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction is 0.23 V, and the for oxygen evolution reaction, it is 0.29 V, indicating that the BN codoped structure is an excellent cathode catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. Further analysis proves that the overpotential is strongly determined by the adsorption behavior of the intermediates in the rate-determining steps (RDS). These findings elucidate the quantitative correlations between intermediate adsorption and catalytic behavior, which provides a promising approach in designing of Li-O-2 battery cathode catalysts with highly activity. In addition, taking BN-SWG as a test case, we find that BN-SWG does not promote the formation of side product Li2CO3. On the other hand, it will not lead to the decomposition of the dimethyl sulfoxide electrolytes, indicating that BN-SWG can improve the reversible cycle life without producing Li2CO3-like species in Li-O-2 batteries.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000626769100006

When the ratio between cobalt and zinc is 1:2 in the synthetic process, the final obtained cobalt and copper oxides supported by nitrogen-doped porous carbon catalyst at 900 degrees C (CoCu/PNC-900) possess hierarchical porous structure with optimal microporous and mesoporous proportion. Besides, the heteroparticle CoCu/PNC-900 also preserves the framework structure of MOF-74 with open porous structure for the exposure of active metal sites and fast mass diffusion in reaction. The optimized conductivity, porosity and full utilization of multiple metals together provide the catalyst with robust electrocatalytic performance. For the catalysis of oxygen reduction reaction, CoCu/PNC-900 displays good electrocatalytic activity with half-wave potential of + 0.811 V (vs. RHE), falling only 19 mV behind commercial Pt/C catalyst (+ 0.830 V vs. RHE) in 0.1 M KOH. Besides activity, CoCu/PNC-900 also shows noticeable stability with 12 mV of degradation after continuous cyclic voltammetry test of 5000 cycles. Furthermore, CoCu/PNC-900 shows 20 mV in potential close to that of IrO2 at 10 mA cm(-2), indicating its decent catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000528996900004

In this work, we pioneer a time- and costefficient strategy for the preparation of large-area flexible CNF films with uniformly distributed diatomic FeN3CoN3 sites (Fe1Co1-CNF). Due to the excellent compatibility and similar functionality of the pre-designed ZnFeCo-NC precursors (ZnFeCo-pre) with the electrospun polymer polyacrylonitrile (PAN), the mixture of ZnFeCo-pre and PAN can be co-electrospun and subject to a standard CNF fabrication process. The resulting Fe1Co1-CNF exhibits excellent bifunctional catalytic performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), attributing to the abundant dual catalytic FeN3-CoN3 sites which are mutually beneficial for attaining optimal electronic properties for the adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates. The assembled liquid-electrolyte ZAB provides a high specific power of 201.7 mW cm-2 and excellent cycling stability. More importantly, due to the good mechanical strength and flexibility of Fe1Co1-CNF, portable ZAB with exceptional shape deformability and stability can be demonstrated, in which Fe1Co1-CNF utility as an integrated free-standing membrane electrode. These findings provide a facile strategy for manufacturing flexible multi-functional catalytic electrodes with high production.									42	1	0	0	1	0	43			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000685280100004

Herein, we report a new class of Pt superstructures (SSs) with surface distortion engineering by electrochemical leaching of PtTex SSs that can largely boost the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In particular, the high-distortion (H)-Pt SSs achieve a mass activity of 2.24 A mg(-1) at 0.90 VRHE for the ORR and 2.89 A mg(-1) for the MOR as well as a low overpotential of 25.3 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. Moreover, the distorted surface features of Pt SSs can be preserved by mitigating the detrimental effects of agglomeration/degradation during long-time electrocatalysis. A multiscale modeling demonstrates that surface compressions, defects, and nanopores act in synergy for the enhanced ORR performance. This work highlights the advances of stable superstructure and distortion engineering for realizing high-performance Pt nanostructures.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000668003400024	34061555

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are the key steps in the commercial application of these energy conversion/storage equipment. Defect-rich transition metal oxides (TMOs), such as Co, Mn, Fe, Ni, etc., have always been one of the most promising electrocatalysts, which are cheap, easy to obtain, high in catalytic activity and stable during electrocatalysis. In this review, we first introduce the definition, classification, characteristics, and construction of defects. Then, the latest developments of defect-rich TMO electrocatalysts in electrocatalysis and energy conversion storage device is summarized. Furthermore, the relationship between defects and activity and the potential mechanism are also discussed. The defects in defect-rich TMOs can adjust the surface/interface electronic structure of the electrocatalyst, change the adsorption energy of the intermediate product, or increase the intrinsic catalytic activity of active sites, which are beneficial for enhanced catalytic performance. Finally, the current challenges and prospects of defect-rich TMO electrocatalysts are proposed. Therefore, the introduction of defects in TMO will be a potential strategy for the rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts in the future.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000579079800001	32970393
