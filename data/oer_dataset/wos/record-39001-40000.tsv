These (Ni@Pt-P/C) electrocatalysts were prepared by a primary replacement method followed by subsequent phosphating process. Among all Ni@Pt-P/C electrocatalysts, as-prepared Ni@Pt-P/C-400 electrocatalyst shows the highest HzOR performance (515 mA mg(pt)(-1)), best stability, durability and lowest activation energy (12.60 kJ mol(-1)). The satisfactory HzOR performance is mainly resulted from the unique design of phosphating effect on core-shell structure which producing good synergistic effect between Ni, P and Pt. This work would pave a way for developing other low-Pt catalysts in the future. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

For example, to simulate the formaldehyde kinetic you make a serial of seven chemical reactions where intervene nine chemical species [2]. The change in concentration with respect to the time of one specie is mathematically represented by means of an ordinary differential equation. In the studied cases, the mechanism of reaction can be represented as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In the simulation of the mechanism of reaction, the medullar part is the solution of all the ordinary differential equation that describe the temporary evolution of the concentration of each the species. The differential equation that comes from the kinetic present what it is called rigidity, principally due to the simultaneous presence of radical with called rigidity, principally due to the simultaneous presence of radicals with a really short life time as the presence of hydroperoxide HO2 center dot and species that remain almost constant as the oxygen. The main problem to carry out the precise integration of the differential equation system that represents the mechanism of reaction of the atmospheric chemistry, is the wide when variation of the kinetic constant as it appears in the reactions 2 and 7 which brings as a consequence the instability when applying an explicit numerical method because for any change in so different scales. When this happens, it is said that the differential equation system is rigid. In order to solve the problem that the rigidity of a differential equation system represented we should use special numerical method that ensures precision and stability in its integration. To achieve this whit a classical explicit method it is required a lot of computing time, besides the possible instability. When using the semi implicit method, we developed a computer package using language C++ to solve the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Solving the matrix system with the method mentioned above, it is found the numerical value of the concentration of the five chemical species for every time step, given the initial concentration. The computer program used to solve the system of differential equation was developed in UNAM.					6th International Conference on Computational Methods for Coupled Problems in Science and Engineering (COUPLED PROBLEMS)6th International Conference on Computational Methods for Coupled Problems in Science and Engineering (COUPLED PROBLEMS)	MAY 18-20, 2015MAY 18-20, 2015	Univ Padova, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn; Tech Univ Catalonia, Int Centre Numerical Methods Engn; Natl Tech Univ AthensUniv Padova, Dept Civil Environm & Architectural Engn; Tech Univ Catalonia, Int Centre Numerical Methods Engn; Natl Tech Univ Athens	Venice, ITALYVenice, ITALY	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-84-943928-3-2	WOS:000380588500116

To fill this gap, we sequenced the whole genomes of nine individuals from three Chinese native endangered cattle breeds that are living in high-altitude or arid environments. Phylogenetic and evolutionary history analyses of these three and other six breeds showed that the genetic structure of the cattle populations is primarily related to geographic location. Interestingly, we identified pervasive introgression from the yak to Zhangmu cattle (ZMC) that cover several genes (e.g., NOS2, EGLN1 and EPAS1) involved in the hypoxia response and previously identified as positive selection genes in other species, which suggested that the adaptive introgression from yak may have contributed to the adaptation of ZMC to high-altitude environments. In addition, by contrasting the breeds in opposite living conditions, we revealed a set of candidate genes with various functions from hypoxia response, water metabolism, immune response and body shape change to embryo development and skeletal system development, etc., that may be related to high-altitude or arid adaptation. Our research provides new insights into the recovery and adaptation of endangered native cattle and other species in extreme environments and valuable resources for future research on animal husbandry to cope with climate change.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1752-4571			WOS:000598253700001	33767758

However, the diversity and distribution of diazotrophic bacteria along the lake depth continuum are so far poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the dynamic variations of diazotrophs in a subtropical deep reservoir during the stratified period. We applied an in-depth biomolecular approach (DGGE, clone libraries, and quantitative real-time PCR) to explore the nitrogenase (nifH) gene diversity and abundance. The diazotrophic community shifted between the oxic/anoxic interface and the nifH diversity increased with depth. The Cyanobacteria, affiliated to the toxic bloom-forming Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, were the dominant diazotrophic cluster in the surface waters, whereas diazotrophic Alphaproteobacteria were dominant in the bottom waters. The relationships between microbial and environmental factors clearly demonstrated that the temperature gradient and the oxygen concentration affect the heterogeneity of the diazotrophic community, thereby influencing the entire aquatic nitrogen cycle.					1st international conference on Challenges in Aquatic Sciences1st international conference on Challenges in Aquatic Sciences	MAR 15-21, 2013MAR 15-21, 2013		Keelung, TAIWANKeelung, TAIWAN	8	5	0	0	7	0	13			0018-8158	1573-5117		WOS:000343998000007		
J	Fernandez, JL; de Chialvo, MRG; Chialvo, AC								Kinetic study of the chlorine electrode reaction on Ti/RuO2 through the polarisation resistance Part 1: experimental results and analysis of the pH effects								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				47	7			1129	1136		10.1016/S0013-4686(01)00837-4				JAN 11 2002	2002	The chlorine electrode reaction (ClER) on Ti/RuO2 electrodes was studied by means of a non-conventional methodology based on the use of the polarisation resistance (Rp). The results obtained in experimental measurements carried out in chlorine saturated NaCl-HCl solutions are presented in this first part. It was verified that only in a limited range of pH the ClER is the main electrode reaction. In this domain, the polarisation resistance of this reaction was measured varying the activity of chloride ions (a(Cl-)(o*)), the partial pressure of chlorine ((p) over bar (Cl2)) and pH (or protons activity a(H+)(o*)). A linear dependence between Rp and a(H+)(o*) was observed, which was explained on the basis of a surface model taking into account the inhibition of active sites by protons. This model leads to an expression for the variation of Rp on pH. which allows obtaining the intrinsic polarisation resistance (Rp(o)), which can be used for the analysis of the kinetic mechanism.

We describe a case of an ischemic stroke revealing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a patient with a history of protein S deficiency and cerebral imaging suggestive of vasculitis. Case Report: A 52-year-old woman, with history of protein S deficiency, was admitted for right hemiparesis and aphasia that happened 6 hours before her consultation. Her National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 11. She had hypoxia (SpO(2) 93%). COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction was positive. Cerebral computed tomography scan showed an ischemic stroke in the territory of the superficial left middle cerebral artery. The recommended time period for thrombolysis was exceeded and we did not dispose of sufficient resources to deliver thrombectomy. She was treated with aspirin, statins, antibiotic therapy, and oxygen. Considering the high risk of thromboembolic complications and the history of protein S deficiency, anticoagulation treatment with heparin followed by acenocoumarol was started. Evolution was marked by the appearance of 24 hours regressive, acute symptoms of confusion. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed new ischemic strokes in both anterior cerebral arteries and on magnetic resonance angiography narrowing of the left internal carotid artery and both anterior cerebral arteries suggestive of vasculitis was seen. We maintained anticoagulation and prescribed methylprednisolone 500 mg daily for 3 days. Evolution was marked by improvement of clinical deficit and respiratory status. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection potentializes the prothrombotic effect and vascular inflammation by accentuating protein S deficit. The place of steroids seems justifiable in the presence of symptoms of vasculitis in brain imaging.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1074-7931	2331-2637		WOS:000714392200011	34734908

However, the study of electrochemical in situ formation of catalysts to improve the activity for the OER is far from being satisfactory. In this work, we prepared a Fe2Co-MIL-88B MOF on nickel foam (Fe2Co MOF/NF) through a solvothermal process. Fe0.67Co0.33OOH was in situ formed on the surface of an Fe2Co MOF during the OER, which is confirmed as the real active species. The electrocatalytic performance is significantly improved due to the electron transfer between Fe and Co, which is confirmed to be related to the positive coupling effect between Co and Fe and the change of the electronic structure caused by the replacement of Co by Fe metal ions in the MOF. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations reveal that the OER on Fe0.67Co0.33OOH follows the Mars-van-Krevelen mechanism. The electrochemical test results show the superior OER activity of the catalyst with a low overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 45.3 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability for 50 hours in 1 M KOH. This study provides a simple and effective strategy for the rational design and structural evolution of MOF-derived materials to achieve inexpensive and effective electrocatalysis.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000655656200001

These sensitizers have been used for photocatalytic hydrogen (H-2) evaluation application. The sensitizers exhibit good light absorption capability and electrochemical properties as well. For increasing water splitting capacity, incorporate platinum salt on TiO2 semiconductor photoanode was performed and compared hydrogen evolution with pure TiO2 photoanode. We have also studied the influence of the sensitizers concentration and the effect of pH of the medium was explored. Using a theoretical measurement optimized both the synthesized dimer dyes structure geometry and the calculated their HOMO-LUMO energy level. Here also reported optimized pH and concentration of sensitizers in the reaction medium and found that the high hydrogen generation efficiency from water splitting is 138.3 mu mol (348 TONs) by the WPTZ2 dye.

A similar decrease in O-2 evolution after 24 h of desiccation, but diverse changes of the O-J-I-P chlorophyll fluorescence transient during desiccation, were observed. Whereas the Fp value remained fairly constant, the Fo value increased with increasing time and rate of desiccation, leading to a decrease in che Fv/Fp value for 70% and 30% RH. Concerning the relative height of the J step, two different trends in the dme courses of the rFj parameter were found. At 85% RH, only a slight rFj increase was observed while at 30% RH an rFj decrease dominated. The samples exposed to 70% RH exhibited both phases: the increasing one was followed by the decreasing one. The Western-blot method indicated that no D1 degradation occurred during desiccation. Similarly, no changes in the E475/E436 band ratio of the Chi fluorescence excitation spectrum at 77K were found for 30% RH. It is suggested that damage to the acceptor side of PSII dominating at 85% RH is followed by a functional disconnection of P680 from the antennae systems, which was apparent at higher rates of desiccation. The notion of different reactions to fast and slow desiccation was further supported by the experiment with the chemically closed PSII.									13	3	0	0	12	0	16			0176-1617	1618-1328		WOS:000080770000006

Herein, a series of highly efficient and noble metal-free CoSx modified Mn0.5Cd0.5S nanocomposites are successfully synthesized via a simple direct precipitation process. The photocatalytic activity of the as-prepared photocatalysts for H-2 production from water splitting under visible-light irradiation is investigated. It can be found that the rate of H-2 evolution over CoSx/Mn0.5Cd0.5S is 2.4 times higher than that of pure Mn0.5Cd0.5S, which is comparable to Mn0.5Cd0.5S modified with 1 wt% platinum (Pt) co-catalyst. The products are systematically characterized by XRD, UV-vis DRS, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, PL and so on. According to the above experimental results, it can be concluded that the amorphous CoSx nanoparticles function as active sites and excellent electron transfer mediators for the catalytic reaction.									49	1	0	0	2	0	49			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000442384800012

Herein, we report a highly efficient and selective E-HAE process at room temperature and ambient pressure over the Cu catalyst. A high Faradaic efficiency of 83.2% for ethylene with a current density of 29 mA cm(-2) is reached at -0.6 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. In-situ spectroscopic characterizations combined with first-principles calculations reveal that electron transfer from the Cu surface to adsorbed acetylene induces preferential adsorption and hydrogenation of the acetylene over hydrogen formation, thus enabling a highly selective E-HAE process through the electron-coupled proton transfer mechanism. This work presents a feasible route for high-efficiency ethylene production from E-HAE.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9				2041-1723		WOS:000727659200016	34873161

Defect-rich MoS2 nanosheets exhibiting enlarged interlayer spacing of 9.2 angstrom were synthesized via a solvothermal method, in which trithiocyanuric acid (TTCA) was used as a sulfur source. In addition, we synthesized MoS2 with L-cysteine for comparison. To improve the conductivity and quantity of active exposed sites of MoS2 nanosheets, the rGO nanosheets were introduced to hybridize with MoS2. With the addition of rGO, the MoS2/rGO hybrids exhibit different morphologies and larger interlayer spacing of 9.5 angstrom. Furthermore, the enhanced performance for hydrogen evolution reaction is attributed to the synergistic effect between the MoS2 nanosheets and rGO substrates. MoS2/rGO-2 possesses an onset overpotential of 118 mV, a small Tafel slope of 51 mV/dec, high double-layer capacitance (C-dl) of 15.27 mF/cm(2), and superior cycling stability over 1000 cycles in acidic conditions.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000516368100004

However, it is still a challenge to improve the surface HER catalytic activity. In this work, the effects of different nonmetallic dopants on the catalytic activity and stabilities of WC (0001) surface for HER were studied by first principles methods. The effects of different types of non-metal (NM = B; N; O; P and S) and doping concentrations (n(i) = 25-100%) on HER catalytic activity and stability were investigated by calculating the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption ( increment G(H)) and substitution energy. It was found that the catalytic performance can be improved by doping O and P non-metallic elements. Especially, the increment G(H) with P doped is -0.04eV better than Pt (-0.085 eV), which is a potential ideal catalyst for HER. Furthermore, the electronic structure analysis was used to explore the origin of the regulation of doping on stability and catalytic activity. The results show that nonmetallic doping is an effective strategy to control the catalytic activity, which provides theoretical support for the future research of HER catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000593503800001

The catalyst is a new and unique material as it consists of copper-decorated TiO2 particles covered tightly in graphene and obtained in a fluidized bed reactor. Both, reduction of copper from Cu(CH3COO) at the surface of TiO2 particles and covering of TiO2-Cu in graphene thin layer by Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) were performed subsequently in the flow reactor by manipulating the gas composition. Obtained photocatalysts were tested in regard to hydrogen generation from photo-induced water conversion with methanol as sacrificial agent. The hydrogen generation rate for the most active sample reached 2296.27 mu mol H-2 h(-1) g(cat)(-1). Combining experimental and computational approaches enabled to define the optimum combination of the synthesis parameters resulting in the highest photocatalytic activity for water splitting for green hydrogen production. The results indicate that the major factor affecting hydrogen production is temperature of the TiO2-Cu-graphene composite synthesis which in turn is inversely correlated to photoactivity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000665400500001

All electrodepositions were done on a Ni mesh substrate from ammoniacal-citrate bath containing different concentrations of Na2WO4. The influence of deposition parameters, such as deposition current density, pH and composition of ammoniacal-citrate bath on electrocatalytic activity of obtained Ni-W coatings toward HER was examined by polarization curve measurements in 6 M KOH at room temperature. The morphology and tungsten content of the Ni-W coatings were investigated by means of SEM and EDS analysis. All investigated electrodes have shown high electrocatalytic activity for the HER. The samples obtained at higher deposition current densities had the lowest overvoltage for the HER. It has been shown that the plating bath pH value is very important parameter in obtaining active coatings.

Anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most studied photocatalysts, but the shape dependence of its activity has not yet been satisfactorily investigated and many questions still remain unanswered. We report the nonaqueous surfactant-assisted synthesis of highly uniform anatase TiO2 NCs with tailorable morphology in the 10-100 nm size regime, prepared through a seeded growth technique. Introduction of titanium(IV) fluoride (TiF4) preferentially exposes the {001} facet of anatase through in situ release of hydrofluoric acid (HF), allowing for the formation of uniform anatase NCs based on the truncated tetragonal bipyramidal geometry. A method is described to engineer the percentage of {001} and {101} facets through the choice of cosurfactant and titanium precursor. X-ray diffraction studies are performed in conjunction with simulation to determine an average NC dimension which correlates with results obtained using electron microscopy. In addition to altering the particle shape, the introduction of TiF4 into the synthesis results in TiO2 NCs that are blue in color and display a broad visible/NIR absorbance which peaks in the infrared (lambda(max) approximate to 3400 nm). The blue color results from oxygen vacancies formed in the presence of fluorine, as indicated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies. The surfactants on the surface of the NCs are removed through a simple ligand exchange procedure, allowing the shape dependence of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution to be studied using monodisperse TiO2 NCs. Preliminary experiments on the photoreforming of methanol, employed as a model sacrificial agent, on platinized samples resulted in high volumes of evolved hydrogen (up to 2.1 mmol h(-1) g(-1)) under simulated solar illumination. Remarkably, the data suggest that, under our experimental conditions, the {101} facets of anatase are more active than the {001}.									763	35	0	0	63	0	774			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000302887300038	22444667

However, the cost of platinized Ti anode used in EOW generators restricts the application of EOW. Ti/RuO2-SnO2-TiO2 anodes were prepared by thermal decomposition method to replace platinized Ti anode in EOW generators. The properties of Ti/RuO2-SnO2-TiO2 electrodes were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The electrochemical properties and accelerated life test were also studied. The EOW generated by Ti/RuO2-SnO2-TiO2 anodes had good quality. The results showed that: 450 degrees C was the optimal temperature for the preparation of anodes. In view of that an appropriate amount of Sn could efficiently refine grain size of coating and chlorine evolution potential of anode, the anodes with 7% Sn content had long accelerated life and low energy consumption for the generation of EOW. EOW had been used for eliminating Escherichia coli, of which sterilization effects significantly improved with increasing the ACC. Killing logarithm (KL) was 4.33 at an ACC of 12.4 mg/L and 5.76 at 33.1 mg/L. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									31	5	0	0	9	0	35			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000306728700019

As the photophysical and photochemical properties of effluent DOM can be changed by wastewater treatment processes, the effect of UV/chlorine treatment on the photophysical and photochemical properties of DOM was investigated using Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA) and Suwannee River natural organic matter (SRNOM) as representatives. Results showed that the absorbance of the two DOM was significantly decreased. The evolution trends of three representative photophysical parameters upon increase of chlorine dosages were observed. Also, a decrease in DOM aromaticity, molecular weight and electron-donating capacity was observed upon increasing chlorine dosage. Quantum yields of excited triplet state of DOM ((DOM)-D-3*), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) and hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) first decreases and then increased in the UV/chlorine systems upon increasing chlorine dosages due to the different reaction pathways of the two DOM. Moreover, (DOM)-D-3* can not only be regarded as a "controller" of other reactive intermediates, but also effectively promote the photodegradation of bezafibrate, which is classified as a persistent organic contaminant. This study gives deep insights into effects of UV/chlorine on the photophysical and photochemical properties of DOM, and is helpful for understanding the dynamic roles of DOM in the photodegradation of micropollutants.

The resonance spectra (recorded after the irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere has been stopped) have been attributed to the parallel and perpendicular components of a triplet line assigned to the delocalization of the uncoupled electron over an effective nuclear spin 1. It was suggested that this effective spin arises from the fast tunneling/rotation of a proton between two positions. The resonance spectra have been simulated with accuracy by using a simplified spin Hamiltonian and assuming Lorentzian-like resonance line shapes and axial asymmetry of the resonance line due to the trapping of free radicals in randomly oriented crystallites. The time evolution of free radicals in nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature has been analyzed. The decay kinetics of stable free radicals in 3-methyl nylon 3 (under inert atmosphere) has been investigated. It was shown that the radiation-induced radicals in inert atmosphere decay through a unimolecular reaction. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The photocatalytic activities of the designed hybrid structures are greatly determined by the efficiencies of charge transfer across the interfaces between different components. In this paper, interface design of Ag-BiOCl-PdOx hybrid photocatalysts is demonstrated based on the choice of suitable BiOCl facets in depositing plasmonic Ag and PdOx cocatalyst, respectively. It is found that the selective deposition of Ag and PdOx on BiOCl(110) planes realizes the superior photocatalytic activity in O-2 evolution compared with the samples with other Ag and PdOx deposition locations. The reason was the superior hole transfer abilities of Ag-(110)BiOCl and BiOCl(110)-PdOx interfaces in comparison with those of Ag-(001)BiOCl and BiOCl(001)-PdOx interfaces. Two effects are proposed to contribute to this enhancement: (1) stronger electronic coupling at the BiOCl(110)-based interfaces resulted from the thinner contact barrier layer and (2) the shortest average hole diffuse distance realized by Ag and PdOx on BiOCl(110) planes. This work represents a step toward the interface design of high-performance photocatalyst through facet engineering.									36	0	0	0	3	0	36			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000412453300013	28796441

Gross O(2) evolution (E(o)) and gross O(2) uptake (E(o)) were determined by a mass spectrometric (16)O(2)/(18)O(2) isotope technique. Under drought stress P(N), g(s), c(i) and U(o) decline. While photochemical fluorescence quenching decreases under water deficit, non-photochemical quenching rises. The maximal efficiency of PSII measured in the dark is not affected by drought; however, in the light, E(o) decreases under water deficit. The ratio P(N)/E(o) falls under stress while the ratio U(o)/E(o) increases, We conclude that tomato plants follow a double strategy to avoid photodamage under drought stress conditions: (1) a substantial portion of light energy is emitted as heat and PSII activity is downregulated, This results in a decrease in E(o) as well as P(N) and U(o.) Despite reduced charge separation at PSII, the decline of CO(2) assimilation because of lowered stomatal conductance and metabolic changes results in the need of degrading excessive photosynthetic electrons, (2) Oxygen is used as an alternative electron acceptor in photorespiration or Mehler reaction and U(o) rises relative to E(o).									41	1	0	0	38	0	44			0031-9317			WOS:000166038800010

Thermal treatment of oxobis(2,4-pentanedionato-O,O')titanium (TiO(acac)(2)) in ethylene glycol (EG) in the presence of sodium acetate and a small amount of water at 573 K yielded microcrystalline brookite-type TIO2. Tungsten(VI) oxide (WO3) powders of monoclinic crystal structure with high crystallinity were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment (HTT), at 523 or 573 K, of aqueous tungstic acid (H2WO4) solutions prepared from sodium tungstate by ion-exchange (IE) with a proton-type resin. Anatase and brookite TiO2 products were calcined at various temperatures and then used for photocatalytic mineralization of acetic acid in aqueous solutions under aerated conditions and dehydrogenation of 2-propanol under deaerated conditions. Almost all the anatase-type TiO2 samples showed the activities more than twice higher than those of representative active photocatalysts, Degussa P-25 and Ishihara ST-01 in both reactions. A brookite sample with improved crystallinity and sufficient surface area obtained by calcination at 973 K exhibited the hydrogen evolution rate almost equal to P-25. HTT WO3 powders with various physical properties were used as photocatalyst for evolution of oxygen (O-2) from an aqueous silver sulfate solution. WO3 powder of high crystallinity, e.g., IE-HTT-WO3 synthesized at 573 K, gave much higher O-2 yield than commercially available WO3 samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The underlying correlation between the properties of the enhanced sodium (Na) ion storage and SEIs in metal-nitrogen (MNX) platform electrodes was not revealed during charging and discharging cycles. Herein, the capacity enhancement of FeNX/C anodes was first clarified by employing in situ temperature-dependent Nyquist plots and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was evidenced that physiochemical evolution of the SEI and surface carbonaceous materials made a significant contribution to the improved sodium storage performance through the following three mechanisms: (1) FeNX catalyzed the reversible conversion of SEIs, beneficial to the storage and release of extra Na ions, (2) a large number of spin-polarized charges were stored on the surface of the reduced Fe species, and (3) the carbon delivered additional capacity through the surface-capacitive effects. As a result, the FeNX/C anode provided a high capacity of 217 mA h g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 2000 mA g(-1). Therefore, the FeNX species catalyzed the reversible conversion reaction of SEIs, which contributed novel avenues to the design of conversion-type electrode materials.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000741636900001

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of electroreduction and storage conditions on an oil/water emulsion made of canola oil and reconstituted skim milk. The electroreduction treatments were carried out at two different anode/cathode voltage differences (0 and 4 V) on a 2% stable oil/water emulsion made of canola oil and skim milk. After each electroreduction treatment, samples of electroreduced emulsion were placed in conditions of storage in regards to headspace (0%, 10%, and 50%), temperature (4 A degrees C and 22 A degrees C) and in the dark for 14 days. The results showed that the electroreduction treatment significantly reduced the redox potential of the emulsion samples to negative values (from +85 to -412 mV) and was also able to decrease their dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (from 3.8 to 2.5 mg.L(-1)). The storage conditions of headspace and temperature have had an important impact on the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) value and the DO value. This study is the first to our knowledge to show that in storage conditions where the gaseous exchanges and especially the oxygen are limited, it is possible to maintain during 14 days a negative ORP in electroreduced oil-water emulsion.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			1958-5586			WOS:000294757200005

Here, a three-dimentional (3D) reduced graphene oxide carbon nanotubes (CNTs/rGO) framework for anchoring molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles is reported for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high performance. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity is attributed to the plenty of factors: the hierarchical 3D structure of rGO sheets and CNTs with rich active sites, the uniform distribution of RuP2 nanoparticles, chemical bonding character of RuP2 and carbon support, and the interfacial electric effect among different components. The RuP2 anchored on CNTs/rGO with mass ratio of 5:2 exhibit the low onset potential of -14.7 V vs. RHE and the lowest overpotential of 50.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in corrosive acidic electrolyte, which are comparable to those of commercial Pt/C (20 wt%). The CNTs in the CNTs/rGO framework can contribute to the well-distribution of RuP2 and rGO sheets and further facilitate the high-rate electron transfer, which will effectively promote the electrocatalytic activity for HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000742805000004

TK1299 exhibited NSR activity with a preference for NADPH and showed strict CoA-dependency similar to that of the Pyrococcus furiosus homologue PF1186. During the assays, the non-enzymatic formation of H2S from S-0 and free CoA-SH was observed, and the addition of enzyme and NADPH enhanced H2S evolution. A catalytic cycle of TK1299 was proposed suggesting that CoA-SH acted to solubilize S-0 by forming CoA persulfides, followed by reduction of an enzyme-S-S-CoA intermediate produced after both enzymatic and non-enzymatic evolution of H2S from the CoA persulfide, with NADPH as an electron donor. TK1481 showed NSR activity independently of CoA-SH, implying a direct reaction with S-0. TK1299, TK1481, and TK0304 exhibited high NOX activity, and the NADH-dependent activities were inhibited by the addition of free CoA-SH. Multiple disruptions of the four group 3 PNDOR homologues in T. kodakarensis demonstrated that none of these homologues were essential for S-0-dependent growth. Many disruptants grew better than the parent strain, but a few multiple disruptants showed decreased growth properties after aerobic inoculation into a pyruvate-containing medium without S-0, suggesting the complicated participation of these group 3 PNDORs in sensitivity/resistance to dissolved oxygen when S-0 was absent.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			1431-0651	1433-4909		WOS:000334932100011	24723088

In the presented work, reduced graphene oxide is formed through electrochemical reduction and applied as an effective interlayer between nickel foam substrate and nickel-cobalt hydroxide catalyst to augment its activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction. Through subsequent cyclic voltammetry deposition of nickel-cobalt hydroxide over the surface of supported interlayer, the prepared electrocatalyst exhibited remarkable performance by reaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 60 mV in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, much lower than that of the same electrocatalyst without interlayer (78 mV). The proposed strategy made the active metallic catalyst phase acquiring a small Tafel slope and superior durability for hydrogen production in alkaline medium. By utilizing the reduce graphene oxide interlayer, the electrical conductivity of the final nickel-cobalt hydroxide electrode was boosted. Furthermore, a clear transition from ordered reticulated arrays of nanosheets to roughened and disordered nanosheet-comprised nanospheres is demonstrated for surface morphology of nickel-cobalt electrocatalyst that indeed prompts the increase in its electrochemically active surface area.

Here, by leveraging controlled surface segregation, we realize core-shell formation with systematic tuning of surface composition on well-defined PdCuRu nanocrystals. When applied for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), we established a direct correlation between surface composition and activity. In particular, PdCuRu catalysts with a Pd-rich surface achieved an overpotential of 31 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 52 mV dec(-1) in an alkaline electrolyte, considerably enhanced relative to control PdCuRu/C catalysts with other surface compositions and even exceeding those of state-of-the-art Pt/C. Similar trends were also observed in both neutral and acid electrolytes. We deduce that, in this catalytic system, the enhanced electrocatalysis originates from the strain effect rather than the bifunctional mechanism. The present study builds a bridge between surface engineering and HER performance, and opens up new material designs for surface Pd-rich core-shell nanostructures for the purpose of improving HER catalytic activity and stability at all pH values.									27	1	0	0	2	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489686400008

It is known that the construction of the central molecular framework of modified tetrapyrroles is mediated via a common, core pathway. Herein a further branch of the modified tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway is described in denitrifying and sulfate-reducing bacteria as well as the Archaea. This process entails the hijacking of siroheme, the prosthetic group of sulfite and nitrite reductase, and its processing into heme and d(1) heme. The initial step in these transformations involves the decarboxylation of siroheme to give didecarboxysiroheme. For d(1) heme synthesis this intermediate has to undergo the replacement of two propionate side chains with oxygen functionalities and the introduction of a double bond into a further peripheral side chain. For heme synthesis didecarboxysiroheme is converted into Fecoproporphyrin by oxidative loss of two acetic acid side chains. Fe-coproporphyrin is then transformed into heme by the oxidative decarboxylation of two propionate side chains. The mechanisms of these reactions are discussed and the evolutionary significance of another role for siroheme is examined.									82	3	0	0	71	0	94			0027-8424			WOS:000296700000027	21969545

Here, we address these three challenges by establishing and exploring an intimate functional link between the reactivity and stability of crystalline (CoS2 and MoS2) and amorphous (CoSx and MoSx) hydrogen evolution catalysts. We propose that Co2+ and Mo4+ centres promote the initial discharge of water (alkaline solutions) or hydronium ions (acid solutions). We establish that although CoSx materials are more active than MoSx they are also less stable, suggesting that the active sites are defects formed after dissolution of Co and Mo cations. By combining the higher activity of CoSx building blocks with the higher stability of MoSx units into a compact and robust CoMoSx chalcogel structure, we are able to design a low-cost alternative to noble metal catalysts for efficient electrocatalytic production of hydrogen in both alkaline and acidic environments.									691	34	2	0	47	1	695			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000368766100024	26618882

Due to the fast kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on platinum (Pt), the Pt loading on the cathode can be reduced from 0.30 mg(Pt) cm(-2) to 0.025 mg(Pt) cm(-2) without any negative effect on performance. On the anode, the iridium (Ir) loading was varied between 0.20-5.41 mg(Ir) cm(-2) and an optimum in performance at operational current densities (>= 1 A cm(-2)) was found for 1-2 mg(Ir) cm(-2). At higher Ir loadings, the performance decreases at high current densities due to insufficient water transport through the catalyst layer whereas at Ir loadings < 0.5 mg(Ir) cm(-2) the catalyst layer becomes inhomogeneous, which leads to a lower electrochemically active area and catalyst utilization, resulting in a significant decrease of performance. To investigate the potential for a large-scale application of PEM water electrolysis, the Ir-specific power density (g(Ir) kW(-1)) for membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) with different catalyst loadings is analyzed as a function of voltage efficiency, and the consequences regarding catalyst material requirements are discussed.

Using oxygen and hydrogen sulfide as natural chemical tracers, the time scale of chemical change was identified in relation to advection, mixing and biological processes. Rapid changes due to advection that took place on an hourly time scale were removed by referring the data back to the temperature of the water. Biological activity dominated the hydrochemical changes observed in the meta- and upper hypolimnion. These were expressed by DO depletion rates of 2.0 and 0.4 g m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Vertical and horizontal mixing were shown to occur on a seasonal time scale. Once the chemical stratification process was completed the slow mixing through the benthic boundary layer became the limiting factor for subsequent reactions in the water column.									40	0	0	0	28	2	42			0168-2563			WOS:000178066500004

OH* emission profiles are used to determine ignition delay times. The second-stage ignition delay time increases with increasing equivalence ratio or dilution level, but is insensitive to pressure especially at high dilution levels. The first-stage ignition delay time is unaffected by the present experimental parameters above 1150 K, below which it decreases with increasing equivalence ratio or pressure. An updated model reconsidering reaction CH3 + NO = H2CN + OH is examined against the experimental measurements from present work and literature, including ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities, and species mole fraction profiles. At fuel-rich condition, this reaction has a significant contribution to the formation of OH radical during the second-stage ignition. The two-stage ignition and intensity evolution of OH peaks are well predicted and explained kinetically by the updated model.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000482184800083

These data suggest that the HupSL dimer is periplasmically oriented, while the HupUV proteins are in the cytoplasmic compartment.									47	0	0	0	36	0	47			0021-9193			WOS:A1997VZ79200041	8982013

However, there has been little investigation on the relationship between the oxidative atmosphere and the structure development of biochar, which can be useful information for the utilization of derived products. In this study, the effect of the oxygen atmosphere on the structure development of loblolly pine-derived biochar during thermal treatment was investigated. Quantitative analysis using solid-state direct polarization/magic angle spinning C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy presented the existence of large fractions of aromatic and non-protonated carbons in the biochars treated at an oxidative atmosphere, implying highly condensed aromatic structures with large cluster sizes. Simultaneous thermogravimetic analyzer-differential scanning calorimetry was employed to demonstrate the difference in heat flow during the thermal treatment at two different atmospheres. Relatively large exothermic heat flow was observed when woody biomass was treated at 350 degrees C under an oxidative atmosphere which might be responsible for the difference in structural alteration. The series of observations suggested that compared to inert atmospheric conditions, admitting a limited amount of oxygen during thermal treatment of woody biomass could promote the evolution of condensed aromatic carbon structures.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000474324600019

The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA is highly similar (71-60% homology) to those of the analogous genes from wheat, tomato, pea, spinach, tobacco and mustard. The expression of the gene that corresponds to the 23 kDa protein was inducible in green organs of mature and immature leaves, stems and young panicles but not inducible in roots. The high level of the transcripts was detected in both mature leaves and young panicles. The expression of the gene was low in etiolated seedlings, while the transcript of the gene was strongly induced by light, and the level of the expression increased during light irradiation. These observations suggest that the expression of the gene encoding the 23 kDa protein is organ-specific and light-inducible.									6	2	0	0	5	0	8			0032-0781			WOS:A1995TK82300034	8589938

Two approaches to the study of the origin of life								ACTA BIOTHEORETICA				55	2			97	131		10.1007/s10441-007-9017-6				JUN 2007	2007	This paper compares two approaches that attempt to explain the origin of life, or biogenesis. The more established approach is one based on chemical principles, whereas a new, yet not widely known approach begins from a physical perspective. According to the first approach, life would have begun with-often organic-compounds. After having developed to a certain level of complexity and mutual dependence within a non-compartmentalised organic soup, they would have assembled into a functioning cell. In contrast, the second, physical type of approach has life developing within tiny compartments from the beginning. It emphasises the importance of redox reactions between inorganic elements and compounds found on two sides of a compartmental boundary. Without this boundary, "life" would not have begun, nor have been maintained; this boundary-and the complex cell membrane that evolved from it-forms the essence of life.									6	0	1	0	2	0	6			0001-5342	1572-8358		WOS:000251009100002	17891504

Here, this is exemplified using indium tin oxide (ITO)-supported Platinum nanoparticles as electrocatalysts at fuel cell (FC) cathodes under degradation protocols to mimic operating conditions in two potential regimes. The evolution of crystal structure, composition, crystallite and particle size is tracked by in situ X-ray techniques (small and wide angle scattering), metal dissolution by in situ scanning flow cell coupled with mass spectrometry (SFC ICP-MS) and Pt surface morphology by advanced electron microscopy. In a regular FC operation regime, Pt poisoning rather than Pt particle growth, agglomeration, dissolution or detachment was found to be the likely origin of the observed degradation and ORR activity losses. In the start-up regime degradation is actually suppressed and only minor losses in catalytic activity are observed. The presented data thus highlight the excellent nanoparticle stabilization and corrosion resistance of the ITO support, yet point to a degradation pathway involving Pt surface modifications by deposition of sub-monolayers of support metal ions. The identified degradation pathway of the Pt/oxide catalyst/support couple contributes to our understanding of cathode electrocatalysts for polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC).									46	0	1	0	1	0	46			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000424152200011

However, the e-NRR performance is currently impeded by the inherent inertness of N-2 molecules, the extremely slow kinetics and the overwhelming competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), all of which cause unsatisfied yield and ammonia selectivity (Faradaic efficiency, FE). Defect and interface engineering are capable of achieving novel physical and chemical properties as well as superior synergistic effects for various electrocatalysts. In this review, we first provide a general introduction to the NRR mechanism. We then focus on the recent progress in defect and interface engineering and summarize how defect and interface can be rationally designed and functioned in NRR catalysts. Particularly, the origin of superior NRR catalytic activity by applying these approaches was discussed from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives in this emerging area are highlighted. It is expected that this review will shed some light on designing NRR electrocatalysts with excellent activity, selectivity and stability.

Among those elements, the origin of phosphorus is of extreme interest because it is known to be essential for life such as we know on Earth. However, current models of (Galactic) chemical evolution under-predict the phosphorus we observe in our Solar System. Here we report the discovery of 15 phosphorus-rich stars with unusual overabundances of O, Mg, Si, Al, and Ce. Phosphorus-rich stars likely inherit their peculiar chemistry from another nearby stellar source but their intriguing chemical abundance pattern challenge the present stellar nucleosynthesis theoretical predictions. Specific effects such as rotation or advanced nucleosynthesis in convective-reactive regions in massive stars represent the most promising alternatives to explain the existence of phosphorus-rich stars. The phosphorus-rich stars progenitors may significantly contribute to the phosphorus present on Earth today. Current models of Galactic chemical evolution under predict the phosphorus we observe in our Solar System. Here, the authors show the discovery of 15 phosphorus-rich stars with a peculiar abundance pattern that challenges the present stellar nucleosynthesis theoretical predictions, but which could explain the missing source of phosphorus in the Galaxy.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2041-1723			WOS:000561124400001	32753582

However, the fast capacity fading and voltage decay as well as low Coulombic efficiency caused by irreversible oxygen release and phase transition during the electrochemical process hinder their practical application. To solve these problems, in the present study, a multifunctional surface construction involving a coating layer, spinel-layered heterostructure, and rich-in oxygen vacancies is successfully conducted by a facile thermal reduction of the LMLO particles with potassium borohydride (KBH4) as the reducing agent. The multifunctional surface structure plays synergistic effects on suppressing the interface side reaction, reducing the dissolution of transition metal, increasing electron conductivity and lithium diffusion rate. As a result, electrochemical performances of the LMLO cathode are effectively enhanced. With optimization of the addition of KBH4, the electrode delivers a reversible capacity of 280 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, which maintains after 100 cycles. The capacity retention with respect to the initial capacity is as high as 98% at 1 C after 400 cycles. The present work provides insights into designing a highly effective functional surface structure of LMLO cathode materials for high-performance LIBs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000818542000001	35768284

On the other hand, interaction with reactive oxygen species in undesired Fenton-like reactions leads to the production of hydroxyl radicals, which rapidly damage cellular macromolecules. Moreover, copper cations strongly bind to thiol compounds disturbing redox-homeostasis and may also remove cations of other transition metals from their native binding sites in enzymes. Nature has learned during evolution to deal with the dangerous yet important copper cations. Bacterial cells use different efflux systems to detoxify the metal from the cytoplasm or periplasm. Despite this ability, bacteria are rapidly killed on dry metallic copper surfaces. The mode of killing likely involves copper cations being released from the metallic copper and reactive oxygen species. With all this knowledge about the interaction of copper and its cations with cellular macromolecules in mind, experiments were moved to the next level, and the antimicrobial properties of copper-containing alloys in an "everyday" hospital setting were investigated. The alloys tested decreased the number of colony-forming units on metallic copper-containing surfaces by one third compared to control aluminum or plastic surfaces. Moreover, after disinfection, repopulation of the surfaces was delayed on copper alloys. This study bridges a gap between basic research concerning cellular copper homeostasis and application of this knowledge. It demonstrates that the use of copper-containing alloys may limit the spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria in hospitals.									131	1	0	0	73	2	132			0175-7598			WOS:000280036300029	20449737

To enable investigation of the fundamental combustion processes relating to such applications, liquid fuels were injected into the reaction zone as dilute sprays in this study. Droplets of ethanol, n-heptane, and n-heptane/toluene blends were produced via an ultrasonic nebuliser, and were carried by air through a central jet to a hot coflow of combustion products. The resulting flames were then analysed using four simultaneous laser diagnostic techniques. Planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) was implemented to perform imaging of key intermediate species, including hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CH2O), while the Mie scattering technique was used to detect the location of droplets. The sooting behaviour of these flames was also investigated, via the laser-induced incandescence (LII) technique. The existence of distinct inner and outer reaction zones is a key feature of all of the flames studied, and this "double flame structure" was found to be related to partial premixing of air and fuel, as well as penetration of droplets into the inner reaction zone. A change in the stabilisation of the inner flame front was observed with variations in fuel type, with a greater likelihood of ignition kernels in the case of the n-heptane and n-heptane/toluene flames, whereas the equivalent ethanol flame displays a bifurcation structure. Variations in the jet Reynolds number and liquid fuel loading were also found to have a notable impact on the distribution and evaporation of droplets, which was in turn found to affect the formation of the double flame structure. Due to the complex coupling between turbulence, chemistry and droplet evaporation in these flames, the accurate prediction of such results a priori is not within the limits of current modelling capabilities. These findings provide a valuable insight to enable future advancements in spray combustion modelling and the design of practical combustion devices. (C) 2021 The Combustion Institute.

This contribution focuses on the cathode, and draws comparisons between nickel foam and nickel mesh substrates. One of the principal electrocatalysts for the cathodic reduction of oxygen is silver, so an improvement in electrochemical performance was obtained by electroplating the nickel foam with silver. The electrodeposition. process was optimised to maximise electrochemical performance with a minimum of silver deposited. Nickel foam, which is less expensive than the usual nickel mesh, appears to be a good substrate for AFC electrode fabrication, especially when incorporating a conducting gas diffusion layer. Silver deposited by electroplating onto the nickel foam was found to result in significantly enhanced electrochemical performance, with a reduction in both the Ohmic resistance of the electrode, as well as the oxygen reduction reaction charge transfer resistance.

The theory is based on two major assumptions: (1) detonation is triggered via the Zeldovich gradient mechanism inside a region of mixed fuel and products, and (2) the mixed region is produced by a turbulent mixing of fuel and products either inside an active deflagration front or during the global expansion and subsequent contraction of an exploding white dwarf. We determine the critical size of the mixed region required to initiate a detonation in a degenerate carbon-oxygen mixture. This critical length is much larger than the width of the reaction front of a Chapman-Jouguet detonation. However, at densities greater than similar or equal to 5 x 10(6) g cm(-3), it is much smaller than the size of a white dwarf. We derive the critical turbulent intensity required to create the mixed region inside an active deflagration front in which a detonation can form. We conclude that the density rho(tr) at which a detonation can form in a carbon-oxygen white dwarf is low, less than 2-5 x 10(7) g cm(-3) but greater than 5 x 10(6) g cm(-3).									144	3	0	0	0	0	145			0004-637X			WOS:A1997WQ32100026

Resonance Raman intensity corresponding to all vibrational degrees of freedom (the symmetric stretch, bend, and asymmetric stretch) is observed, demonstrating that excited-state structural evolution along all three coordinates occurs upon photoexcitation. The electronic absorption and absolute resonance Raman cross sections are reproduced employing the time-dependent formalism for Raman scattering using an anharmonic description of the (2)A(2), excited-state potential-energy surface. Analysis of the resonance Raman cross-sections demonstrates that both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms are operative in cyclohexane. Comparison of the experimentally determined, gas-phase (2)A(2) surface to that in solution defined by the analysis presented here shows that although displacements along the symmetric stretch and bend are similar in both phases, evolution along the asymmetric stretch is dramatically altered in solution. Specifically, employing the gas-phase potential along this coordinate, the predicted intensity of the overtone transition is an order of magnitude larger than that observed. The analysis presented here demonstrates that the asymmetric stretch overtone intensity is consistent with a reduction in excited-state frequency along this coordinate from 1100 to 750 +/- 100 cm(-1). This comparison suggests that differences in evolution along the asymmetric stretch may be responsible for the phase-dependent reactivity of OClO. In particular, the absence of substantial evolution along the asymmetric stretch in solution results in the ground-state symmetry of OClO being maintained in the (2)A(2) excited state. The role of symmetry in defining the reaction coordinate and the nature of the solvent interaction responsible for modulation of the excited-state potential energy surface are discussed.									42	0	0	0	2	0	42			1089-5639			WOS:A1997XM05900018

The Co nanosheet array and CoFeBO nanosheet array are electrochemically deposited on Ni foam electrodes, which are able to drive a large current density at low overpotentials, and offer stable operation under heavy-loading conditions over an extended period, exceeding the performance of Pt/C and IrO2. To the best of our knowledge, the CoFeBO NS parallel to Co NS couple is currently the most active and stable non-noble electrocatalyst pair for overall water splitting in alkaline electrolytes. In addition, the facile synthesis method is suitable for designing and screening highly active and stable electrocatalysts with micro-and nano-structures.									32	2	0	0	1	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408267300054

Here, the efficient H2O2 generation was accomplished by pi-pi coupling of AQ onto the few-layered graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanoplates through one-step mechanochemical treatment. A H2O2 generation rate of 231 mM h(-1) was obtained using AQ-coupled g-C3N4 nanoplates under visible light illumination, exceeding that of the g-C3N4 nanoplates and bulk g-C3N4 by 7-time and 14-time, respectively. Experimental results showed that the high oxygen reduction efficiency could be ascribed to the enhanced surface area, more exposed active sites and the distinct AQ roles of the electrons storage and restraining the charge recombination. This work inspired future work in synthesizing H2O2 through a sustainable and green route. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we have used fluorescence decay kinetics to quantitatively probe Photosystem II electron transport upon depletion of these components by standard salt washing protocols. Our results indicate that in addition to the expected oxidizing-side defects, removal of PsbP and PsbQ with 2 M NaCl significantly slows the rate of electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B). Electron transfer from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) in Photosystem II reaction centers with an occupied Q(B) site was slowed by a factor of 12, while electron transport from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) in centers with an unoccupied Q(B) site was slowed by a factor of 6. Subsequent removal of the PsbO protein by treatment with 200 mM NaCl and 2.6 M urea did not induce further reducing-side alterations. Our results demonstrate that Studies attributing defects observed upon PsbP and PsbQ removal solely to the oxidizing side must be viewed with caution.									31	0	3	0	29	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:000273267300005	19947648

These subunits are bound to the lumen side of PS II core proteins embedded in the thylakoid membrane. Our experiments reveal that a significant fraction of each subunit is normally present in unassembled pools within the thylakoid lumen. This conclusion was supported by immunological detection of free subunits after freshly isolated pea thylakoids were fractionated with low levels of Triton X-100. Plastocyanin, a soluble lumen protein, was completely released from the lumen by 0.04% Triton X-100. This gentle detergent treatment also caused the release from the thylakoids of between 10 and 20%, 40 and 60%, and 15 and 50% of OE33, OE23, and OE17, respectively. Measurements of the rates of oxygen evolution from Triton-treated thylakoids, both in the presence and absence of Ca2+, and before and after incubation with hydroquinone, demonstrated that the OEC was not dissociated by the detergent treatment. Thylakoids isolated from spinach released similar amounts of extrinsic proteins after Triton treatment. These data demonstrate that physiologically active chloroplasts contain significant pools of unassembled extrinsic OEC polypeptide subunits free in the lumen of the thylakoids.									53	1	1	0	49	0	55			0021-9525			WOS:A1991GL28100004	1918144

Remarkably, air-equilibrated samples of Lucina Hb I were found to be more rapidly oxidized by nitrite than any previously studied Hb, while those of Lucina Hb II showed an unprecedented resistance to oxidation induced by nitrite. Nitrite-induced oxidation of Lucina Hb II was enabled only when O(2) was removed from its active site. Structural analysis revealed that O(2) "clams up" the active site by hydrogen bond formation to B10Tyr and other distal-side residues. Quaternary effects further restrict nitrite entry into the active site and stabilize the hydrogen-bonding network in oxygenated Lucina Hb II dimers. The dramatic differences in nitrite reactivities of the Lucina Hbs are not related to their O(2) affinities or anaerobic redox potentials, which were found to be similar, but are instead a result of differences in accessibility of nitrite to their active sites; i.e. these differences are due to a kinetic rather than thermodynamic effect. Comparative studies revealed heme accessibility to be a factor in human Hb oxidation by nitrite as well, as evidenced by variations of rates of nitrite-induced oxidation that do not correlate with R and T state differences and inhibition of oxidation rate in the presence of O(2). These results provide a dramatic illustration of how evolution of active sites with varied heme accessibility can moderate the rates of inner-sphere oxidative reactions of Hb and other heme proteins.

The O-2 generation rates of 2.34 and 2.24 mmol h(-1) g(-1) are achieved under full sunlight (>200 nm) and visible light (>420 nm), respectively, which are among the highest photocatalytic activities for oxygen production to date. The reason is attributed to the desirable incorporation of visible-light-active LDH shell with UV light-responsive TiO2 core for promoted solar energy utilization. Most importantly, the combined experimental results and computational simulations reveal that the strong donor-acceptor coupling and suitable band matching between TiO2 core and LDH shell facilitate the separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs, accounting for the highly efficient photocatalytic performance. Therefore, this work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy for the design and fabrication of hierarchical semiconductor materials, which can be applied as photocatalyst toward water splitting and solar energy conversion.									181	14	0	0	23	0	185			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000353057600005

Still, the structure instability originating from irreversible oxygen redox at high voltage remains a challenge. Here, a high sustainability cobalt-free P2-Na0.72Mn0.75Li0.24X0.01O2 (X = Ti/Si) cathode is developed. The outstanding capacity retention and voltage retention after 150 cycles are obtained in half-cells. The finding shows that Ti localizes on the surface while Si diffuses to the bulk of the particles. Thus, Ti can act as a protective layer that alleviates side reactions in carbonate-based electrolyte. Meanwhile, Si can regulate the local electronic structure and suppress oxygen redox activities. Notably, full-cells with hard carbon (approximate to 300-335 W h kg(-1) based on the cathode mass) deliver the capacity retention of 83% for P2-Na(0.72)Mn(0.75)Li(0.24)Si(0.01)O(2 )and 66% for P2-Na(0.72)Mn(0.75)Li(0.24)Ti(0.01)O(2 )after 500 cycles; this electrochemical stability is the best compared to other reported cathodes based on oxygen redox at present. The superior cycle performance also stems from the ability to inhibit microcracking and planar gliding within the particles. Altogether, this finding offers a new composition for developing high-performance low-cost cathodes for NIBs and highlights the unique role of Ti/Si ions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000793796500018	35481894

However, a perspective on its photocurrent in the PFC, especially its relationship with the performance of organics degradation, is still not explicitly defined. Here, we demonstrated the co-existence of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and organic substance (COD) oxidation currents theoretically and technically in the PFC using TiO2 for wastewater remediation because the low valence band position of the TiO2 allows simultaneous interface reactions of water to oxygen and organics to carbon dioxide. These two reactions could compete for the exited holes. The benchmark of the COD current has been further measured and calculated from the J-V curves, which reveals a complicated apportionment, from 5.9% to 52.8% of the COD current, of the overall photocurrent in the PFC. These values are strongly affected by the morphologies, the electrolyte, and also the pollutant concentrations. A huge enhancement, more than two-fold the COD current, of the organic oxidation has been observed on morphologically reshaped long TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNTAs) with mu m scaled large pit holes compared to the traditional long TNTAs with a planar surface. This result indicates a significant morphologic benefit, which in detail, probably allows a more efficient organic migration onto the tube wall surface because of the large pit holes. The comparison of the COD current between normal long-, short-TNTAs, a sol-gel TiO2 film, and the newly developed pit-type TNTAs demonstrates that the pit-type TNTAs are most robust for COD oxidation with a much larger COD current over all these traditional TiO2 electrodes. This benchmark of the COD current, including the demonstration of the photocurrent sources in a PFC, could probably provides insight into the design of the photoanodes and gives a more fair evaluation of the photoanode performance, which could also support the development of more efficient photoanodes in the future.

Benefiting from the hierarchical hollow nanostructure, the CoWO4-Co(OH)2 nanoboxes offer plenty of metal active centers available for reaction intermediates. Moreover, the well-defined nanointerfaces between CoWO4 and Co(OH)2 can function as the bridge for boosting the efficient electron transfer from CoWO4 to Co(OH)2. As a consequence, the optimized CoWO4-Co(OH)2 nanoboxes can exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance toward OER by delivering 10 mA cm-2 with a low overpotential of 280 mV and a small Tafel slope of 70.6 mV dec-1 as well as outstanding electrochemical stability. More importantly, this CoWO4- Co(OH)2 heterostructured nanocatalyst can couple with Pt/C to drive overall water splitting to achieve 10 mA cm-2 with a voltage of 1.57 V.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000848390500001	36001865

Kinetic study of the reduction by CO of strongly adsorbed oxygen species								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				220	1			3	12		10.1016/S0021-9517(03)00267-7				NOV 15 2003	2003	Transient experiments using mass and FTIR spectroscopy as detectors are performed at 300 K with a reduced 2.9% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst to study the reduction of strongly adsorbed oxygen species (denoted O-sads) formed by O-2 chemisorption using several y% CO/z% Ar/He mixtures (y and z in the range 0.5-10). During the first seconds of the reaction C mass balances reveal that the CO consumption is mainly due to the formation of a strongly adsorbed CO species identified as a linear CO species (denoted L) interacting with the O-sads species (IR band at 2084 cm(-1)). The evolution of the CO2 production rate with time on stream presents different profiles according to the reaction temperature: decreasing exponential at T-r < 273 K and peak profiles for T-r greater than or equal to 300 K. The CO2 production at T-r < 273 K is in agreement with a kinetic model considering two elementary steps: the adsorption of the L CO species without competition with Osads followed by a L-H elementary step (denoted S3b): O-sads + L --> CO2ads, with a rate constant k(3b) = v(3b) exp(-E-3b/RT) and E-3b = 65 kJ/mol at theta(Osads) approximate to 1. For T-r > 300 K, mass transfer processes contribute to the apparent CO2 production rate. At high theta(Osads) values, they compete with the surface reactions for 273 K < T-r < 360 K and finally dominate the CO2 production at T-r > 360 K. However, kinetic studies can be performed at T-r > 300 K after a significant decrease in theta(Osads) due to the increase in E-3b: E-3b = 110 kJ/mol at theta(Osads) = 0.4. Several conclusions of the present study are in very good agreement with the reduction of O-sads species on Pt single crystals using a CO molecular beam under UHV conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Nonlinear relationships between carbon dioxide and oxygen levels and reaction rates are key to their physiology but cannot be handled with standard techniques of constraint-based metabolic modeling. We demonstrate that incorporating these relationships as constraints on reaction rates and solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem yields realistic predictions of the response of C4 systems to environmental and biochemical perturbations. Using a new genome-scale reconstruction of maize metabolism, we build an 18000-reaction, nonlinearly constrained model describing mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in 15 segments of the developing maize leaf, interacting via metabolite exchange, and use RNA-seq and enzyme activity measurements to predict spatial variation in metabolic state by a novel method that optimizes correlation between fluxes and expression data. Though such correlations are known to be weak in general, we suggest that developmental gradients may be particularly suited to the inference of metabolic fluxes from expression data, and we demonstrate that our method predicts fluxes that achieve high correlation with the data, successfully capture the experimentally observed base-to-tip transition between carbon-importing tissue and carbon-exporting tissue, and include a nonzero growth rate, in contrast to prior results from similar methods in other systems.									26	1	0	0	22	0	26			1932-6203			WOS:000372582800091	26990967

The conventional photocata-lysts such as transition metal catalysts used for organic synthetic transformations face some drawbacks such as weak visible light absorbance, expensive, potentially toxic, and difficult to synthesize. As well as organic photocatalysts, for instance, xanthene dyes like Eosin Y and Rose Bengal exhibit inefficiency to harvest the broadband light source, difficulty to modify the molecular structure, as a result of which the redox potentials of the photocatalysts cannot be readily tuned with different substrates. Photoredox/energy transfer catalysis is the capable embodiment for tomorrow's synthetic research and hence, there is a dire need to overcome the limitations and to develop highly efficient photocatalysts that promote the sustainable energy, and interestingly BODIPY falls in that category. Being the most versatile and widely discussed organic fluorophore, BODIPY has considerable impact on different fields such as flu-orescence imaging, photodynamic theory, functionalized materials, optoelectronics and has majorly influenced the field of organic synthesis by its most dynamic property as a photosensitizer. This review article widely discusses the application of the BODIPY/aza-BODIPY dye as a photocatalyst for photoredox/ energy transfer catalytic organic reactions to produce simple to highly functionalized organic molecules. BODIPY molecule displays highly desirable chemical and physical properties such as high absorbance in the visible region, remarkable thermal and photochemical stabilities, high fluorescence quantum yield, and modularity, making it the more efficient photocatalyst over the popular conventional photocatalysts. In addition, green/NIR light-absorbing BODIPY photocatalysts with long-lived triplet excited state are uti-lized to elevate SET and EnT processes for selective photocatalysis under mild condition. This review pre-sents a broad perspective of BODIPY/aza-BODIPY based photocatalysts in synthetic organic transformation and its significant advances over other conventional dyes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-8545	1873-3840		WOS:000829290300003

These light-harvesting complexes and cofactors have been actively mimicked using dyes, semiconductors and catalytic nanoparticles. However, the photosynthetic scaffold that optimizes both the capture and distribution of light and separates both the oxidative and reductive species has been mimicked much less often, especially using polymer substances. Here we report the synthesis of hollow nanospheres sized in the optical range and made of a robust semiconductor, melon or carbon-nitride polymer. These hollow nanospheres are shown to function as both light-harvesting antennae and nanostructured scaffolds that improve photoredox catalysis, which was determined to have a 7.5% apparent quantum yield via a hydrogen-generation assay.									792	51	0	0	76	0	815			2041-1723			WOS:000313514100049

The adding unit is in fluid communication with a source of the aqueous fluid. A mixing unit is provided for mixing the aqueous fluid. The mixing unit is in fluid communication with the adding unit. A cavitation device is in fluid communication with the mixing unit, and comprises a cavitation chamber, a first cavitation unit, and a second cavitation unit. An oxidizing unit is provided for electrochemically oxidizing the oxidizable matter in the aqueous fluid, and is in fluid communication with the cavitation device. USE - System for treating oxidizable matter in aqueous fluid. ADVANTAGE - The hydrodynamic cavitation component can cost effectively and readily attack and easily destroy less stable organic substances and matter in water, when the contaminants are mixed in the fluid with more recalcitrant forms. The ultrasonic power application and frequency modulation prevents synchronous cavitation pressure gradients caused by unchanging inertial cavitation bubble and bubble swarm patterns while maintaining overall cavitation activity within the chamber with an adjustable dominant frequency that can be optimized to specific application of the technology to water and its constituents. The high current density is effectively utilized to allow for the production of more oxidants from water and the water constituents as well utilize those produced by cavitation, and the supplemental reagents at lower power rates. The evolution of unwanted hydrogen and oxygen is minimized when higher power is required. The mixer is able to have other options that can be installed within, so that process reactions can be monitored for overall system control, and to enhance and provide additional oxidation conditions for process performance by serving as a reactor. The fluid conductivity is increased which directly relates to a reduction in water resistance within the electrode gap between the cathode and anode of the electrochemical oxidation cell in addition to being oxidant precursors when in the conditions of the disclosed technology, thus the electric power demand is reduced. The mixing reactor provides a high mixing index, increases residence mixing/contact/reaction time with an increase in overall length and the quantity and frequency of features, provides low resistance to flow and reduced head loss with lower pump energy demand without need of a motor driven or passive flow blocking obstacles such as ribbons, spindles, paddle or flow diversion arrays, and also contribute to the oxidant formation and subsequent oxidation reactions. The sinusoidal mixing reactor is necessary to enhance the formation of oxidants and/or extend their legacy, and facilitate the destruction of recalcitrant contaminants while also ensuring adequate mixing to uniformly distribute water constituents and oxidants within the fluid to achieve process efficiencies and performance with consistent water quality objectives of the treated water outlet effluent, because of the concentrated nature of the fluid.

J	Cousins, AB; Bloom, AJ								Oxygen consumption during leaf nitrate assimilation in a C-3 and C-4 plant: the role of mitochondrial respiration								PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT				27	12			1537	1545		10.1111/j.1365-3040.2004.01257.x				DEC 2004	2004	Measurements of net fluxes of CO2 and O-2 from leaves and chlorophyll a fluorescence were used to determine the role of mitochondrial respiration during nitrate (NO3-) assimilation in both a C-3 (wheat) and a C-4 (maize) plant. Changes in the assimilatory quotient (net CO2 consumed over net O-2 evolved) when the nitrogen source was shifted from NO3- to NH4+ (DeltaAQ) provided a measure of shoot NO3- assimilation. According to this measure, elevated CO2 inhibited NO3- assimilation in wheat but not maize. Net O-2 exchange under ambient CO2 concentrations increased in wheat plants receiving NO3- instead of NH4+, but gross O-2 evolution from the photosynthetic apparatus (J(O2)) was insensitive to nitrogen source. Therefore, O-2 consumption within wheat photosynthetic tissue (DeltaOmega(2)), the difference between J(O2) and net O-2 exchange, decreased during NO3- assimilation. In maize, NO3- assimilation was insensitive to changes in intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i); nonetheless, DeltaOmega(2) at low C-i values was significantly higher in NO3--fed than in NH4+-fed plants. Changes in O-2 consumption during NO3- assimilation may involve one or more of the following processes: (a) Mehler ascorbate peroxidase (MAP) reactions; (b) photorespiration; or (c) mitochondrial respiration. The data presented here indicates that in wheat, the last process, mitochondrial respiration, is decreased during NO3- assimilation. In maize, NO3- assimilation appears to stimulate mitochondrial respiration when photosynthetic rates are limiting.									30	3	0	0	27	0	32			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000225487500008

With respect to this, a photocatalytic water splitting by visible light through heterojunction semiconductors has been anticipated as a route to the sustainable energy.For the first time, we integrate a potential conjugated donor-acceptor (DA) co-monomer such as 2, 3-dichloroquinoxaline (DCQ) within the structure of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) by a facile one-pot co-polymerization process. The DCQ which is acting as an organic motif that simulates a nucleophilic attack on the hosting PCN semiconductor which extends into a long chain of the polymer having enormous surface area and remarkable photocatalytic activity for H-2 and O-2 evolution as compared to the parental CNU.The supremacy of molecular geometry with DA ratio is effectively studied by absorbent, calculated band gap and migration of electrons on the photocatalytic performance of as-synthesized CNU-DCQx co-polymer. The density functional theory (DFT) calculation deliver supplementary evidence for the positive incorporation of DCQ in to the PCN matrix with reduced band gap upon copolymerization.Further, the hydrogen evolution rate (HER) for pure CNU with 14.2 mu mol/h while for CNU-DCQ(18.0) it is estimated at 124.9 mu mol/h which remarkably fueled almost eight times more than blank sample. Similarly, the oxygen evolution rate (OER) analysis indicates the production 0.2 mu mol/h (visible) and 1.5 mu mol/h (non-visible) for CNU. However, the OER of copolymerized CNU-DCQ(18.0) is found to be 1.9 mu mol/h (visible) and 12.8 mu mol/h (non-visible) which almost nine times higher than parental CNU.Hence, the output of this work reflects as an important step on the way to tailor-designed and elucidate the promising role of D-pi-A system for the rational motifs of productive photocatalysts for forthcoming request.

Genes for multiple hemoglobin types coexist in mycobacterial genomes, but M. leprae has retained only glbO, encoding a group-II truncated hemoglobin. Mycobacteritium tuberculosis GlbO has been involved in oxygen transfer and respiration during hypoxia, but a role in protection from nitric oxide (NO) has not been documented yet. Here, we report that the in vitro reaction of oxygenated recombinant M. leprae GlbO with NO results in an immediate stoichiometric formation of nitrate, concomitant with heme-protein oxidation. Overexpression of GlbO alleviates the growth inhibition of Escherichia coli hmp (flavohemoglobin gene) mutants in the presence of NO-donors, partly complementing the defect in Hmp synthesis. A promoter element upstream of glbO was predicted in silico, and confirmed by using a glbO::lacZ transcriptional fusion in the heterologous Mycobacterium smegmatis system. The glbO::lacZ fusion was expressed through the whole growth cycle of M. smegmatis, and moderately induced by NO. We propose that M. leprae, by retaining the unique truncated hemoglobin GlbO, may have coupled O-2 delivery to the terminal oxidase with a defensive mechanism to scavenge NO from respiratory enzymes. These activities would help to sustain the obligate aerobic metabolism required for intracellular survival of leprosy bacilli. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The degradation of methoxyl groups is an essential part of this process. The presence of wood greatly stimulates the demethoxylation of a non-phenolic lignin model compound (a [(OCH3)-C-14]-labeled beta-O-4 dimer) by the lignin-degrading white-rot fungi Phlebia radiata and Phanerochaete chrysosporium. When grown on wood, both fungi produced up to 47 and 40% (CO2)-C-14 of the applied C-14 activity, respectively, under air and oxygen in 8 weeks. Without wood, the demethoxylation of the dimer by both fungi was lower, varying between 0.5 and 35%. Addition of nutrient nitrogen together with glucose decreased demethoxylation when the fungi were grown on spruce wood under air. Because the evolution of (CO2)-C-14 in the absence of wood was poor, the fungi may have preferably used wood as a carbon and nitrogen source. The amount of fungal mycelium, as determined by the ergosterol assay, did not show connection to demethoxylation. P. radiata also showed a high demethoxylation of [(OCH3)-C-14]-labeled vanillic acid in the presence of birch wood. The degradation of lignin and lignin-related substances should be studied in the presence of wood, the natural substrate for white-rot fungi.									12	1	0	0	10	0	13			0302-8933	1432-072X		WOS:000236961500008	16502311

The synthesis features one-pot pyrolysis of inexpensive fluid catalytic cracking slurry, graphitic carbon nitride, and inorganic salts, followed by a feasible surface phosphidation process. As a non-noble metal catalyst, Ni2P/NPC-P demonstrates excellent performance in hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolytes with a low overpotential of 73 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm???2 (??10) and a small Tafel slope of 56 mV dec???1, meanwhile exhibits durability with no significant ??10 change after 2000 catalytic cycles. Theoretical calculation reveals that the negatively charged P-enriched surface accelerated the rate-determining transformation and desorption of OH*. In overall water splitting, the electrocatalyst achieves a low ??10 of 1.633 V, promising its potential in the cost-effective mass production of hydrogen fuel.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000813094200001	34460231	
J	Wienold, J; Timpe, O; Ressler, T								In situ investigations of structure-activity relationships in heteropolyoxomolybdates as partial oxidation catalysts								CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL				9	24			6007	6017		10.1002/chem.200305227				DEC 15 2003	2003	The structural evolution of Keggin-type heteropolyoxomolybdates (HPOM) during thermal treatment in propene and in propene and oxygen in the temperature range from 300 to 773 K was investigated by in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with mass spectrometry. During treatment in propene or hydrogen and at reaction temperatures above 673 K, the initially triclinic H-3[PMo12O40]-13H(2)O is transformed quantitatively into a cubic HPOM (Pn3m, a=11.853 Angstrom) exhibiting a long-range structure similar to that of the corresponding cesium salts. The treatment described constitutes the first readily available preparation route for a cubic HPOM without alkali metal ions in the structure. For both H-3[PMo12O40] and CS2H[PMo12O40] migration of molybdenum from the Keggin ion onto interstitial sites is proposed to occur in propene or hydrogen at temperatures above about 573 K to give thermally stable, partially reduced lacunary Keggin ions. During activation in propene and oxygen the onset of catalytic activity of H-3[PMo12O40] and Cs2H[PMo12O40] at about 573 K correlates with partial reduction of Mo and characteristic changes in the local structure of the Keggin ion. The structural changes observed indicate that, similar to the treatment of the HPOM in propene, migration of molybdenum from the Keggin ions onto interstitial sites and formation of lacunary Keggin ions take place. Moreover, the formation of these partially reduced lacunary Keggin ions appears to be a prerequisite for the material to become an active heterogeneous catalyst. Evidently, the undistorted Keggin ion in the as-prepared HPOM has to be regarded as a precursor of the active catalyst.									30	0	0	0	3	0	30			0947-6539			WOS:000187425200006	14679513	
J	Coleman, M; Matthews, CM; Trotman, CNA								Multimeric hemoglobin of the Australian brine shrimp Parartemia								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				18	4			570	576		10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003837				APR 2001	2001	The hemoglobin molecule of the commercially important brine shrimp Artemia sp. has been used extensively as a model for the study of molecular evolution. It consists of nine globin domains joined by short linker sequences, and these domains are believed to have originated through a series of duplications from an original globin gene. In addition, in Artemia, two different polymers of hemoglobin, called C and T, are found which differ by 11.7% at the amino acid level and are believed to have diverged about 60 MYA. This provides a set of data of 18 globin domain sequences that have evolved in the same organism. The pattern of amino acid substitution between these two polymers is unusual, with pairs of equivalent domains displaying differences of up to 2.7-fold in total amino acid substitution. Such differences would reflect a similar range of molecular-clock rates in what appear to be duplicate, structurally equivalent domains. In order to provide a reference outgroup, we sequenced the cDNA for a nine-domain hemoglobin (P) from another genus of brine shrimp, Parartemia zietziana, which differs morphologically and ecologically from Artemia and is endemic to Australia. Parartemia produces only one hundredth the amount of hemoglobin that Artemia produces and does not upregulate production in response to low oxygen partial pressure. Comparison of the globin domains at the amino acid and DNA levels suggests that the Artemia globin T gene has accumulated substitutions differently from the Parartemia P and Artemia C globin genes. We discuss the questions of accelerated evolution after duplication and possible functions for the Parartemia globin.									4	0	0	0	5	0	5			0737-4038			WOS:000167898300014	11264409

Thus, transition metal nickel cobalt oxides are widely inspected as promising electrode materials for electrocatalysis and supercapacitors. However, the pure NiCo2O4 was highly hindered by its widespread uses due to low electronic conductivity and deficient active edges. This study is aimed to fabricate the NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 composite using a solvothermal process with different ratios of solvents. The inherent NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 composite holds plentiful active edges and improved electrical conductivity than the pure. Interestingly, the electrocatalytic results revealed that the NiCo/NiO/NiCo2O4 (NC) composite prepared by a solvent ratio of (double distilled water (DDW) to N, N-Dimethylformamide (DMF)) 2:1 (NC1) displayed the small overpotentials of 144 and 142 mV to realize 10 mA cm(-2) with the robust durability during a 24 hours hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) test in the acid and alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Moreover, the designed NC1 composite as a supercapacitor electrode exhibited considerable capacitance of 638 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1). In comparison, the analog DDW to DMF ratio 1:1 (NC2) and 1:2 (NC3) structures showed 514 F g(-1) and 415 F g(-1), respectively. Further, a dual-electrode device was fabricated using the NC1 composite and activated carbon, exhibited an energy density of 28.14 W h kg(-1) at 414.45 W kg(-1) power density with excellent device stability (89.4%) for 10 000 charge/discharge cycles.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000674849500001

Here, we introduce defects on varied MoS2 surfaces by suitable doping of nitrogen atoms in a sulfur-rich reaction environment, resulting in stable and scalable phase conversion. The experimental characterizations along with the theoretical calculations within the framework of density functional theory establish the impact of nitrogen doping on stabilization of defects and reconstruction of the 2H to IT phase. The as-synthesized MoS2 samples exhibit excellent dye removal capacity in the dark, facilitated by a synergistic effect of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and adsorption. Positron annihilation spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance studies substantiate the role of defects and associated sulfur vacancies toward ROS generation in the dark. Further, on the basis of its ample ROS generation in the dark and in the light, the commendable antimicrobial activity of the prepared MoS2 samples against fungal pathogen Alternaria alternata has been demonstrated. Thus, the present study opens up a futuristic avenue to develop newer functional materials through defect engineering by suitable dopants toward superior performances in environment issues.									20	1	0	0	4	0	20			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000505626900054	31795638

At positive electrode potentials near the onset of the copper dissolution reaction the electrode surface is covered by a uniaxially incommensurate iodide adlayer showing an additional one-dimensional long-range height modulation superimposed on the atomic corrugation. The atomic distances and the wave length of the striped superstructure change with the applied electrode potential indicative for an electrocompression process. The iodide layer close to the saturation coverage can be understood in terms of a uniaxially expanded c(2 x 2)-I structure. The resulting unit cell can be described as c(p x 2)-I with p > 2a(Cu).At saturation coverage a nearest neighbor distance of 3.7 Angstrom is found which is significantly smaller than the iodine van-der-Waals diameter.In contrast to a uniformly expanded iodide layer at positive potentials, regular domain wall structures are observed at more negative potentials.At a certain potential close to the onset of the hydrogen evolution reaction a first order phase transition leads to the formation of a c(6 x 2)-I phase which remains stable even under massive hydrogen evolution. Dynamic STM measurements exhibit a preferential direction for this phase transition along the substrate <011> directions. The role of defects such as step edges for this phase transition is elucidated by high resolution STM images. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This low B supply facilitated the appearance of brown purple pigmentation on the plant leaves over the entire growth period. Compared to B-sufficient (BS) leaves, leakage from B-deficient (BD) leaves was 20 fold higher for potassium, 38 fold for sucrose, and 6 fold for phenolic compounds. High level of membrane peroxidation was detected by measuring peroxidase activities as well as peroxidative products in ED sunflower plants. Soluble and bound peroxidase activities measured in ED thylakoid membranes were accelerated two fold compared to those detected in BS-membranes. No detectable change in soluble peroxidase activity in roots whereas a 4 fold stimulation in bound peroxidase activity was detected. Thylakoid membranes subjected to low B supply showed enhancement in lipoxygenase activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in parallel with 40 and 30 % decrease of linoleic and linolenic acid contents (related to total unsaturated fatty acids), A slower rate of Hill reaction activity (40 %) and a suppressed flow of electron transfer of the whole chain (30%) were detected in ED thylakoid membranes, This reduction was accompanied with a decline in the activity of photosystem 2 shown by a diminished rate of oxygen evolution (42 %) coupled with a quenching (27.5 %) in chlorophyll a fluorescence emission spectra at 685 nm (F-685) Thus B is an important element for membrane maintenance, protection, and function by minimizing or limiting production of free oxygen radicals in thylakoid membranes of sunflower leaves.									67	2	1	0	67	0	73			0300-3604			WOS:000084921800009

The distinct capabilities of SACs for oxidation, hydrogenation, and electrocatalytic reactions have led to the optimization of activity and selectivity through composition variation. However, characterization methods such as infrared and X-ray spectroscopy are incapable of direct observations at atomic scale. Advances in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including aberration correction, monochromators, environmental TEM, and micro-electro-mechanical system based in situ holders have improved catalysis study, allowing researchers to peer into regimes previously unavailable, observing critical structural and chemical information at atomic scale. This review presents recent development and applications of TEM techniques to garner information about the location, bonding characteristics, homogeneity, and stability of SACs. Aberration corrected TEM imaging routinely achieves sub-angstrom ngstrom resolution to reveal the atomic structure of materials. TEM spectroscopy provides complementary information about local composition, chemical bonding, electronic properties, and atomic/molecular vibration with superior spatial resolution. In situ/operando TEM directly observe the evolution of SACs under reaction conditions. This review concludes with remarks on the challenges and opportunities for further development of TEM to study SACs.									19	1	0	0	2	0	19			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000620992800001	33624398

The work presented here shows that chlorite dismutase from Dechloromonas aromatica (DaCld) also catalyzes the decomposition of bromite (BrO2-) with the evolution of O-2 (k(cat) = (2.0 +/- 0.2) x 10(2 )s(-1); k(cat) /K-M = (1.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) at pH 5.2). Stopped -flow studies of this BrO2- decomposition as a function of pH show that (1) the two-electron oxidized heme, compound I (Cpd I), is the primary accumulating heme intermediate during O-2 evolution in acidic solution, (2) Cpd I and its one-electron reduction product, compound II (Cpd II), are present in varying ratios at intermediate pHs, and (3) only Cpd II is observed at pH 9.0. The pH dependences of Cpd I and Cpd II populations both yield a pKa of 6.7 +/- 0.1 in good agreement with the pKa of DaCld activity with ClO2-. The observation of a protein-based amino acid radical (AA center dot ), whose appearance coincides with that of Cpd II, supports the hypothesis that the conversion of Cpd Ito Cpd II occurs via proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) from a heme-pocket amino acid to the oxidized porphyrinate of Cpd Ito yield a dead-end decoupled state in which the holes decay at different rates. The site of the amino acid radical is tentatively assigned to Y118, which serves as a H-bond donor to propionate 6 (P6). The favoring of Cpd II:AA center dot accumulation in alkaline solution is consistent with the amino acid oxidation being rate limited by transfer of its proton to P6 having a pKa of 6.7. Examination of reaction mixtures comprising DaCld and ClO2- by resonance Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal the formation of Cpd II and center dot ClO2, which forms in preference to the analogous AA center dot in the BrO2- reaction. The addition of ClO- to Cpd II did not yield O-2. Together, these results are consistent with heterolytic cleavage of the O- BrO- and O-ClO- bonds yielding Cpd I, which is the catalytically active intermediate. The long-lived Cpd II that forms subsequently, is inactive toward O-2 production, and diminishes the amount of enzyme available to cycle through the active Cpd I intermediate.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000826896200001	35903520

Here, MoSe2 and N-doped carbon (NC) is successfully constructed into a double-shelled hierarchical hollow nanobox. The obtained NC@MoSe2 is demonstrated to be an active catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The NC@MoSe2 delicately combine the structural and functional advantages of two-dimensional layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and NC, which yield the striking synergistic effect to endow them with extremely enhanced electrochemical activity to efficiently catalyze the evolution of H-2. Remarkably, the NC@MoSe2 with the optimum thickness of MoSe2 shell can exhibit a fairly low onset potential of 61 mV, an extremely small overpotential of 164 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2), a greatly reduced Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1), and a higher exchange current density of 0.102 mA cm(-2). Specifically, this is mainly beneficial from the abundant exposed active edges from the edge-terminated ultrathin MoSe2 nanosheets with small size, the overall hierarchical hollow architecture and strong electronic coupling between MoSe2 and NC layer. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation results have well supported the experimental observations, revealing the strong synergistic effect between NC and MoSe2, thus the increased carrier density around the Fermi level and reduced hydrogen adsorption free energy (Lambda G(H*)) for MoSe2 composited with NC.

The physiological bases for the repeatability of these traits has been the focus of much research in recent years, in an attempt to explain the mechanistic drivers for behavioral syndromes. Whilst a range of studies have demonstrated repeatable individual differences in physiological traits, little is known about potential trade-offs between reproductive investment and the physiological responses to subsequent stressors. We therefore sought to test the behavioral and physiological responses of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to a novel environment, quantifying a series of repeated "temporal reaction norms" before and after reproduction. Given that reproductive investment is costly both in time and energy, it is likely to affect expression of behavioral and physiological traits. We hypothesised that reproductive investment would impact the consistency of these temporal reaction norms. Specifically, we predicted that individuals which invested more in reproduction would show altered rates of habituation to a stressful stimulus. Therefore, we quantified temporal reaction norm components (i.e., intercept and slope) of two behaviours and metabolic rate (MR) within and among individuals before and after a breeding season. We found that individuals consistently differed in how their locomotor and feeding activity increased upon introduction into a novel environment and also how their MR decreased after being handled and confined within the metabolic chamber. We also found that the slope of the feeding activity reaction norm was negatively correlated with stress-induced corticosterone levels at the within-individual level. Finally, in contrast to our prediction, we found that neither the intercept nor slope of the reaction norms were influenced by the reproductive effort (the number of fledglings produced) displayed by individual males. This suggests that the substantial individual variation in the expression of physiological and behavioural traits is not plastic with respect to the immediate consequences of reproductive investment. This study is the first quantification of metabolic rate reaction norms and their relationships with fitness, which represents an important first step towards understanding the evolutionary significance of instantaneous habituation to stressful and novel situations.									5	0	0	0	5	0	5			0016-6480	1095-6840		WOS:000520946200007	31991098

This is because, kinetically, silver dissolution in dilute nitric acid with molarity 5M (or lower) is not favorable at ambient temperature and pressure. We recently reported (Deng and Detsi in Nanoscale 9:11858, 2017; Fu et al. in ACS Appl Nano Mater 1(8):4164, 2018) on the use of catalytically driven reduction reactions to enhance the rate of nanoporous silver and nanoporous gold formation at ambient temperature and pressure by free corrosion dealloying in hydrochloric acid, a nonoxidizing acid. Here, we further elucidate these findings by combining our experimental studies with the mixed potential theory of corrosion to shed more light on the reaction mechanisms associated with free corrosion dealloying of silver-aluminum alloys, and gold-silver alloys in various corroding media and in the presence of a catalyst used to enhance the dealloying rate.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000462009900050

In recent work, Rout and co-workers proposed a novel, swarms of trajectories (SoT) method for determining the transition paths of such events. It consists of the dynamical refinement on the system's free energy surface of a putative transition path that is parametrized in terms of a set of collective variables (CVs) that are identified as being important for the transition. In this work, we have implemented the SoT method and used it to investigate the catalytic mechanisms of two enzymatic reactions using hybrid QM/MM potentials. Our aim has been to test the performance of SoT for enzyme systems and to devise robust simulation protocols that can be employed in future studies of this type. We identify the conditions under which converged results can be obtained using inertial and Brownian dynamical evolutions of the CVs, show that the inclusion of several CVs can give significant additional insight into the mechanisms of the reactions, and show that the use of minimum energy paths as starting guesses can greatly accelerate path refinement.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			1520-6106			WOS:000351329400044	25286154

However, the strong chemical stability of the N N bond and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cause the nonideal efficiency of N-2 -> NH3 conversion in actual operation. For the first time, a Mo2C/C heterostructure was fabricated as a PEC cathode for N-2 reduction under environmental conditions. The Mo2C/C heterostructure could effectively decrease the coverage of hydrogen spillover and inhibit the competitive HER, resulting in a desirable selectivity for N-2 activation. Meanwhile, the decoration of the C shell further promoted the stability and conductivity of Mo2C. Mo sites of Mo2C were considered as activation centers, which played a dominant role in the final PEC performance. An optimal NH3 yield rate of up to 6.6 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) was achieved with the Mo2C/C heterostructure, which was almost 3 times that with pristine C. The faradic efficiency (FE) of the Mo2C/C heterostructure was 37.2% at 0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl). This work not only provides an insight into the interplay between the Mo2C/C heterostructure and N-2 activation, but also reveals its great potential in NH3 synthesis by a green route.									8	2	0	0	1	0	8			0743-7463			WOS:000599322400035	33232605

Here, a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room-temperature are reported for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5 nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen-vacancies and unsaturated Nb dual-sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH4. The oxygen-vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb2O5 from 3.01-2.25 eV, which broadens the light-absorption range from ultraviolet to visible-light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO2, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. The formation of a highly stable Nb-CHO* intermediate at the dual sites is proposed to be the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for CH4 production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under visible-light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000768188400001	35181950

Through first principle calculations, this work investigated 3d/4d transition metal (TM) embedded alpha-borophene monolayer (BM-alpha) as efficient electrocatalyst for N2 reduction reaction (NRR). The computational results show that V, Cr, and Mo@BM-alpha exhibit excellent catalytic activity for ammonia synthesis via the enzymatic pathway. Analyses reveal that the unoccupied d orbitals of TM (V, C, and Mo) accept lone pair electrons from N2 while the anti-bonding orbitals of N2 accept a large amount of negative charge from TM, which lead to the elongation of the N---N triple bond, thus effectively activating the nitrogen. In addition, V@BM-alpha and Mo@BM-alpha show a strong suppressive effect on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and overcome the possible oxidation on the catalyst surface. Our results demonstrate the alpha-borophene is a superior substrate for single atom catalysts which can be designed as high performance NRR electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2210-271X	1872-7999		WOS:000810463800001

In this work, we developed a simple sulfur-anion doping strategy to obtain the S-doped NiCo composite (S-NiCo@50) on Ni foam (NF) via a one-step electrochemical deposition. It was found that doped sulfur plays a crucial role in reducing the overpotential of hydrogen evolution by providing abundant active sites as identified by the XPS spectrum. The formed metallic Ni and Co effectively promoted electron transportation. The synergistic effects between the amorphous CoxNiyS(x+y) substance and crystalline Ni and Co metal seemed to result in enhanced HER activity. In particular, the S-NiCo@50 electrode, featuring a hierarchical morphology, showed an ultralow overpotential of 28 and 125 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1.0 M NaOH with a large exchange current density (j(o)) of 4.8 mA cm(-2) as well as high conductivity and stability; its catalytic properties are superior to most of the reported alkaline electrocatalysts and are on par with commercial Pt/C. Assembled with the counter electrode (Ni-Fe/NF), the overall water splitting was proved with a low 1.55 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, we built the Ni24Co6S6 cluster as the S-NiCo@50 model and revealed its intrinsic activity by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study shows that S-doping and component control can be an exquisite strategy for realizing high-efficiency electrochemical water reduction.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000442614000007	30066706

In this comprehensive review, light is shed on general synthetic approaches encompassing chemical reduction, sonochemical, microwave, and thermal treatment among the preparative methods for the syntheses of Ag-based NMs and their catalytic applications. Additionally, some of the latest innovative approaches such as continuous flow integrated with MW and other benign approaches have been emphasized that ultimately pave the way for sustainability. Moreover, the potential applications of emerging Ag NMs, including sub nanomaterials and single atoms, in the field of liquid-phase catalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis as well as a positive role of Ag NMs in catalytic reactions are meticulously summarized. The scientific interest in the synthesis and applications of Ag NMs lies in the integrated benefits of their catalytic activity, selectivity, stability, and recovery. Therefore, the rise and journey of Ag NM-based catalysts will inspire a new generation of chemists to tailor and design robust catalysts that can effectively tackle major environmental challenges and help to replace noble metals in advanced catalytic applications. This overview concludes by providing future perspectives on the research into Ag NMs in the arena of electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000686257100001	34661205

Herein, the application of the Continuous Flow Hydrothermal Synthesis (CFHS) is presented to prepare various nano Mn oxides in supercritical water with common and low-cost precursors and additives, yielding an outstanding production rate of 1 Kg day(-1). Since Mn oxidation state spans from MnII to Mn-VII, the implemented process generates, with exquisite selectivity and consistency, nanosized MnO, alpha-MnO2, beta-MnO2, lambda-MnO2, Mn2O3, Mn3O4 and LiMn2O4 oxides with reproducible characteristics of the obtained phase under controlled synthetic conditions. As a case study, all our MnOx nanomaterials were tested as catalyst precursors in the Single Electron Transfer (SET) oxidation of olefins with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds, obtaining recyclable active materials whose respective activity depends on the particular oxide structure, therefore proving the importance of phase selectivity in the final application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000653229500169

Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Co3O4 (meso-Co3O4) nanobundles with uniform shape and size by employing a hard-template method. In this study, the incipient wetness impregnation technique has been chosen for loading metal precursor into the silica hard template (SBA-15). The results reveal that the concentration of a saturated precursor solution plays a vital role in mesostructured ordering, as well as the size and shape of the final meso-Co3O4 product. The optimized precursor concentration allows us to synthesize ordered meso-Co3O4 with four to seven nanowires in each particle. The meso-Co3O4 structure exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity for both glucose and water oxidation reactions.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000441879900016	29808600

Investigations carried out here in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte showed that degradation is by dissolution of V in the electrolyte while Bi is retained on the anode probably in the form of solid Bi oxide (Bi2O3, Bi4O7). Accumulation of Bi oxide on the anode surface leads to passivation from further degradation. Thermodynamic modeling of possible degradation reactions has provided theoretical support to this mechanism. This self-passivation is accompanied by a decrease in photocurrent density, but it protects the anode against extensive photocorrosion and contributes to long-term stability. This is a more definitive understanding of degradation of BiVO4 during water splitting in a photoelectrochemical cell. This understanding is imperative for both fundamental and applied research.									29	1	0	0	1	1	29				2589-0042		WOS:000488278300083	31522120

They reveal how GAS catalyzes formation of the clavam nucleus, via a process unprecedented in synthetic organic chemistry, and suggest how it discriminates between substrates and controls reaction of its highly reactive ferryl intermediate. The presence of an unpredicted jelly roll beta-barrel core in CAS implies divergent evolution within the family of 2OG and related oxygenases, Comparison with other non-heme oxidases/oxygenases reveals flexibility in the position which dioxygen ligates to the iron, in contrast to the analogous heme-using enzymes.									244	3	0	0	175	0	249			1072-8368			WOS:000085173000014	10655615

Infrared absorption measurements showed that all the hydrogen present in the films is lost at annealing temperatures below 600 degreesC without any change in the oxygen to silicon ratio of the films. The activation energy of the hydrogen release is in the 0.21-0.41 eV range independently of film composition, suggesting that the process occurs via network bond reactions. For annealing temperatures higher than 700 degreesC, a change in the Si-O-Si stretching wave number from the initial unannealed value to the 1070-1080 cm(-1) range was promoted, independently of the initial film composition. Electron spin resonance measurements showed that all the films contain two type of bulk paramagnetic defects: the E-' center (.Si=O-3) and the silicon dangling bond center (.Si=Si-3). The RTA process promotes a general decrease of defect concentration for annealing temperatures below 400 degreesC. At higher temperatures, E' center disappears, and the .Si=Si-3 center increases its concentration up to the 10(17)-10(18) cm(-3) range. This suggests that the RTA at higher temperatures promotes the formation of a high-quality, almost defect-free, SiO2 matrix in which highly defective Si nanocrystals are also formed, where the .Si=Si-3 centers are located.

However, the practical application of rechargeable AZMBs are hindered by the poor reversibility of Zn metal anode, owing to easy dendrite growth and serious side reactions. Herein, the preparation of heterogeneous interfacial film with highly dispersed and confined zinc salt in a 2D channel by coassembling polyamide 6, zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate, and layered double hydroxides, which significantly suppresses the dendrite formation, H-2 evolution reaction as well as O-2 corrosion is reported. The as-developed Zn anodes exhibit a long cycling life up to 1450 h with low reversible deposition potential. Moreover, the assembled Zn||Mn battery delivers a high initial capacity of 321 mAh g(-1) and a low capacity decay of approximate to 0.05% per cycle after 590 cycles, which is promising for high-performance AZMBs. A fluorescent film to realize the in situ observation of the Zn anode during cycling, which provides a new chance for visual observation of the working state of the Zn interface, is also assembled.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000660444700001	34117707

Herein, we have synthesized a series of Pd3Sn bimetallic catalysts with different morphologies that transitioned from nanonetwork to nanostrips and then to nanodots by altering the varieties of reducing agents and the amount of surfactant. And the formation mechanisms of nanocatalysts were also investigated. It is worth noting that Pd3Sn-dots, due to the unique structure, uniform dispersion and ultra-small size, exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation reaction and ethylene glycol oxidation reaction, which distinctly higher than the other Pd3Sn catalysts and commercial Pd/C catalysts. Moreover, the as-prepared Pd3Sn catalysts also performed greater long-term durability due to the electronic and synergistic effects. This work provides guidance on the morphology-dependent nanocrystals, which will show a great potential as anodic catalysts in direct fuel cell applications.

However, the mechanism of photo-thermal catalysis of the MnOx/g-C3N4 composite remains unresolved. In this paper, MnOx/g-C3N4 catalysts with different molar ratios were synthesized by the precipitation approach at room temperature. The as-prepared catalysts exhibit excellent synergistic photo-thermal catalytic performance towards the purification of NO in air. The MnOx/g-C3N4 catalysts contain MnOx with different valence states on the surface of g-C3N4. The thermal catalytic reaction for NO oxidation on MnOx and the photo-thermal catalytic reaction on 1:5 MnOx/g-C3N4 were investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). The results show that light exerted a weak effect on NO oxidation over MnOx, and it exerted a positive synergistic effect on NO conversion over 1:5 MnOx/g-C3N4. A synergistic photo-thermal catalytic cycle of NO oxidation on MnOx/g-C3N4 is proposed. Specifically, photo-generated electrons (e(-)) are transferred to MnOx and participate in the synergistic photo-thermal reduction cycle (Mn4+ -> Mn3+ -> Mn2+). The reverse cycle (Mn2+ -> Mn3+ -> Mn4+) can regenerate the active oxygen vacancy sites and inject electrons into the g-C3N4 hole (h(+)). The active oxygen (O-) was generated in the redox cycles among manganese species (Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+) and could oxidize the intermediates (NOH and N2O2-) to final products (NO2- and NO3-).

Density functional calculations were used to elucidate the reaction mechanism of water oxidation catalyzed by this nickel complex and to capture the role of the phosphate. The calculations demonstrated that the oxidations of the starting [OH2-Ni-II-PY5](2+) complex by two sequential proton-coupled electron-transfer processes lead to the formation of a key intermediate [O=Ni-IV-PY5](2+). O-O bond formation then takes place through a water nucleophilic attack on the high-valent Ni-IV=O moiety of the catalyst, facilitated by a hydrogen phosphate anion, with a total barrier of 11.5 kcal mol(-1). The calculated barrier agrees very well with the experimental turnover frequency of about 2000 s(-1), which corresponds to a barrier of 12.9 kcal mol(-1). The calculated deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 1.99 is also in excellent agreement with the experimental value of 2.06. Finally, we also predicted the catalytic activity of other PY5-based first-row transition metal complexes, namely, involving Mn, Fe, Co and Cu. The calculations showed that the Mn, Fe, Co complexes have higher barrier for water oxidation, while the Cu complex has lower barrier and higher water oxidation activity compared with the Ni complex.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000492066700001		
J	Ludlow, Michelle K.; Skone, Jonathan H.; Hammes-Schiffer, Sharon				Hammes-Schiffer, Sharon/B-7325-2013				Substituent effects on the vibronic coupling for the phenoxyl/phenol self-exchange reaction								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				112	2			336	343		10.1021/jp0753474				JAN 17 2008	2008	The impact of substituents on the vibronic coupling for the phenoxyl/phenol self-exchange reaction, which occurs by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, is investigated. The vibronic couplings are calculated with a grid-based nonadiabatic method and a nuclear-electronic orbital nonorthogonal configuration interaction method. The quantitative agreement between these two methods for the unsubstituted phenoxyl/phenol system and the qualitative agreement in the predicted trends for the substituted phenoxyl/phenol systems provides a level of validation for both methods. Analysis of the results indicates that electron-donating groups enhance the vibronic coupling, while electron-withdrawing groups attenuate the vibronic coupling. Thus, if all other aspects of the reaction are the same, then electron-donating groups will increase the rate, while electron-withdrawing groups will decrease the rate. Correlations between the vibronic coupling and physical properties of the phenol are also analyzed. Negative Hammett constants correspond to higher vibronic couplings, while positive Hammett constants correspond to similar or slightly lower vibronic couplings relative to the unsubstituted phenoxyl/phenol system. In addition, lower bond dissociation enthalpies, ionization potentials, and redox potentials. as well as higher pK(a) values, tend to correspond to higher vibronic couplings relative to the unsubstituted phenoxyl/phenol system. The observed trends enable the prediction of the impact of general substituents on the vibronic coupling, and hence the rate, for the phenoxyl/phenol self-exchange reaction. The fundamental physical insights obtained from these studies are applicable to other proton-coupled electron transfer systems.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			1520-6106			WOS:000252287200019	17939710

For the latter, we propose that some main-sequence dwarfs in globular clusters accrete material lost by red giant primary components of close binaries during a common envelope event. As a consequence of the new reaction rates, we are drawn to the conclusion that the anomalies in [Al/Fe] in globular cluster red giants are in fact manifestations of Al-26(8) abundance variations (instead of the stable isotope Al-27) produced by deep mixing. However, Al overabundances observed in some of the subgiants in NGC 6752 are unlikely to be due to the unstable Al-26(g) isotope but have to be the result of the other primordial component of our combined scenario, i.e., intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. These should also provide the source for enhanced Mg-25, necessary for the Al-26(g) production in deep mixing events.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X			WOS:000171440100012

However, the development of a facile, effective, and universal method to improve the photocatalytic activity of these crystals remains an enormous challenge. We have developed a simple method to modify the surface environment of SrTiO3 by ethanol quenching, which results in enhanced UV, visible and infrared light absorption and photocatalytic performance. The SrTiO3 nanocrystals were preheated to 800 degrees C and immediately quenched by submersion in ethanol. X-ray diffraction patterns, electron paramagnetic resonance spectra, and X-ray photoelectron spectra indicated that upon rapid ethanol quenching, the interaction between hot SrTiO3 and ethanol led to the introduction of a high concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the SrTiO3 lattice. Consequently, to maintain the regional charge balance of SrTiO3, Sr2+ could be substituted for Ti4+. Moreover, oxygen vacancies induced localized states into the band gap of the modified SrTiO3 and acted as photoinduced charge traps, thus promoting the photocatalytic activity. The improved photocatalytic performance of the modified SrTiO3 was demonstrated by using it for the decomposition of rhodamine B and production of H-2 from water under visible or solar light.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2079-4991		WOS:000475352900077	31207919

In this paper, it puts forward a brief and scalable strategy, so as to synthesize a novel bifunctional nickel-iron layered double hydroxide and multi-walled carbon nanotube composites supported on Ni foam, represented as NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF is able to realize an efficient electrocatalysis for UOR. During this process, merely a potential of 1.335 V is needed at 10 mA cm(-2), which can be taken to replace OER, thus reducing overpotential in H-2-production as well as power consumption. In addition, NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF also exhibits electro-defense electrocatalytic efficiency to achieve the reaction of hydrogen evolving process, which provides a low overpotential of 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). To further prove it, all-water-urea electrolysis measurement is carried out in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M Urea with NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF as cathode and anode respectively. NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF parallel to NiFe-LDH/MWCNTs/NF electrode manages to provide 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of merely 1.507 V, 156 mV lower than that of water splitting, which proves its commercial viability in energy-saving hydrogen production.

Chemisorption of methane								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				159	2			441	448		10.1006/jcat.1996.0108				APR 1 1996	1996	When submitted to CH4 at atmospheric pressure, EUROPT-1 (a 6.3 wt% Pt/SiO2 catalyst) is able to chemisorb CH4 with parallel evolution of H-2 at T greater than or equal to 150 degrees C. C2H6 is also produced but at a rate approximately 10 times lower, so that H-deficient hydrocarbonaceous fragments build up on the metal surface. Temperature-programed desorption spectra obtained just after chemisorption show that CH4 can be removed from the surface mainly in two peaks, one at approximate to 60 degrees C and the second at a temperature varying between 180 and 250 degrees C. Formation of CH4, accompanied by small amounts of C2H6 and traces of C3H8, is observed during subsequent temperature-programed surface reaction with H-2 of the adspecies remaining after each TPD interrupted at 300 degrees C. The total amount of CH4 initially chemisorbed can be easily derived from those experiments and the WC ratio of the surface species formed during chemisorption can also be estimated. It has been shown that the amount of chemisorbed CH4 increased and the WC ratio strongly decreased when the temperature or the duration of exposure was increased. When EUROPT-1 was submitted to (Ar, CH4) mixtures instead of pure CH4, the increase of the CH4 content had an effect similar to that of the increase of either the temperature or the duration of exposure. Moreover the TPD and TPSR spectra are very sensitive to the conditions of the exposure, so that they constitute some fingerprint of the adspecies at the end of the adsorption step.

However, among other challenges, the design of active and selective catalysts still limits such advances. Herein, we explored the atomistic engineering of the catalyst substrate as a strategy to tune Cu catalysts for CO2 reduction towards different C-1 products by using generalized coordination numbers, GCN, as a structural descriptor of catalytic properties. We observed bifurcations on reaction mechanisms and significant changes in the predicted onset potentials, U-onset, towards CO, HCOOH, and CH4 as a function of the GCN values of the adsorption sites. For each product, we observed volcano plots of U-onset as a function of GCN that indicate activity peaks. We also compared the evolution of U-onset for different products to show that, regardless of the small U-onset values for CH4 on low-coordination sites, such adsorption sites should be more selective towards CO. For Cu nanoparticles, the analysis showed that decreasing the nanoparticle size could lead to more active catalysts that should be highly selective towards CO, which qualitatively agrees with experimental results.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000742080800001

The oscillations depended on the length of the previous dark period, the length of previous illumination, and the reaction temperature.

Pathologic manifestations involve O-center dot(2)-, H2O2, (OH)-O-center dot, enoyl radicals ((center dot)ALA and (center dot)AA) and their oxidation end products.Methods: To characterize enoyl radicals resulting from reaction of (OH)-O-center dot radicals with ALA and AA, micromolar (OH)-O-center dot concentrations were produced by pulse radiolysis of ALA and AA in aqueous solutions.Results: ALA and AA react with center dot OH at it = 1.5 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1). At pH 7.4, the (center dot)ALA absorbance spectrum has a maximum at 330 nm (epsilon = 750 M-1 cm(-1)). This band appears as a shoulder at pH 83 where two ALA species are present: (NH3)(+)-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-COO- and NH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-COO- (pKa = 83). At pH 8.3, (center dot)ALA reacts with oxygen (k = 1.4 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1)) but not with O-center dot(2)-. At pH 8.3, AA oxidation produces two (center dot)AA species characterized by an absorbance spectrum with maxima at 330 and 450 nm. (center dot)ALA and (center dot)AA are repaired by antioxidants (quercetin (QH), catechin, trolox, ascorbate) which are semi-oxidized (k > 10(8) M-1 s(-1)). QH bound to HSA or to apoferritin and ferritin repairs (center dot)ALA and (center dot)AA. In O-2-saturated apoferritin solutions, (center dot)Q, O-center dot(2)-, (center dot)AA and reaction product(s) react with QH.Conclusions: The optical absorption properties and the time evolution of (center dot)ALA and (center dot)AA were established for the first time. These radicals and their reaction products may be neutralized by antioxidants free in solution or bound to proteins.General significance: Adjuvant antioxidant administration may be of interest in pathologies related to excess ALA or AA production.

Herein, the authors develop a new type of reconfigurable fluoride (such as CoF2) pre-catalysts, with ultra-fast and in-depth self-reconstruction, substantially promoting HER activity. By experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the unique surface structure of fluorides, alkaline electrolyte and bias voltage are identified as key factors for complete reconstruction during HER. The enrichment of F atoms on surface of fluorides provides the feasibility of spontaneous and continuous reconstruction. The alkaline electrolyte triggers rapid F- leaching and supplies an immediate complement of OH- to form amorphous alpha-Co(OH)(2) which rapidly transforms into beta-Co(OH)(2). The bias voltage promotes amorphous crystallization and accelerates the reconstruction process. These endow the generation of mono-component and crystalline beta-Co(OH)(2) with a loose and defective structure, leading to an ultra-low overpotential of 54 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and super long-term stability exceeding that of Pt/C. Moreover, DFT calculations confirm that F- leaching optimizes hydrogen and water adsorption energies, boosting HER kinetics. Impressively, the self-reconstruction is also applicable to other non-noble transition metal fluorides. The work builds the fundamental comprehension of complete self-reconstruction during HER and provides a new perspective to conceive advanced catalysts.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12				2198-3844		WOS:000717588200001	34766738

The ultra-fast freeze-quench approach makes possible trapping such intermediates with consequent analysis of their chemical structure by means of different physical spectroscopic methods (e.g., EPR, optic, and Mossbauer spectroscopies). This chapter presents the description of a setup that allows stopping the enzymatic reaction in the time range from 100 11sec to tens of msec. The construction and production technology of the mixer head, ultra-fast freezing device, and accessories required for collecting a sample are described. Ways of solving a number of problems emerging on freezing of the reaction mixture and preparing the samples for EPR spectroscopy are proposed. The kinetics of electron transfer reaction in the first enzyme of the respiratory chain, Complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase), is presented as an illustration of the freeze-quench approach. Time-resolved EPR spectra indicating the redox state of Fes clusters of the wild-type and mutant (R274A in subunit NuoCD) Complex I from Escherichia coli are shown.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0076-6879		978-0-08-087776-1	WOS:000265605300004	19348883

Herein, manganese oxide/hydroxide was demonstrated as a highly active electrocatalysts for the HER by fabricating MnO2 nanosheets coated with Cu2O nanowire arrays (Cu2O@MnO2 NW@NS) on Cu foam followed by an in situ chronopotentiometry (CP) treatment. It was discovered that the in situ transformation of Cu2O@MnO2 into Cu@Mn(OH)(2) NW@NS by the CP treatment drastically boosted the catalytic activity for the HER due to an enhancement of its intrinsic activity. Together with the benefits from such three-dimensional (3D) core-shell arrays for exposing more accessible active sites and efficient mass and electron transfers, the resulting Cu@Mn(OH)(2) NW@NS exhibited excellent HER activity and outstanding durability in terms of a low overpotential of 132 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm(2). Overall, we expect these findings to generate new opportunities for the exploration of other Mn-based nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts and enable further understanding of their catalytic processes.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000427907700005

The obtained MOF with the formula {[Cu0.5La2(HPDC)(PDC)(2)(SO4)(H2O)(2)]H2O}(n) (PDC: 3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate) has a 3D non-porous lattice with a single type of octahedrally coordinated Cu-II and two distinct nonacoordinated LaIII ions, with sulphate being a linker between the Cu-II and La-III centers. CuLa-MOF exhibits catalytic activity to promote the aerobic autooxidation of benzylic hydrocarbons and the aerobic oxidation of cycloalkenes. Compared with a homogenous catalyst, Cu(OAc)(2), CuLa-MOF, as a heterogeneous catalyst, exhibits similar activity, but the solid is recyclable with some minor decrease in activity from the first to the second catalytic cycle; after which, a steady activity is observed, as determined by the coincidence of temporal evolution of the reaction upon reuse.									35	0	0	0	2	0	35			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000378276100008

In this study, we systematically mapped out the detailed reaction pathways of O-3 activation on 10 potential active sites of 8 representative configurations of N-DNCs, including the pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, N on edge, and porphyrinic N, based on the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The DFT results indicate that O-3 decomposes into an adsorbed atomic oxygen species (O-ads) and an O-3(2) on the active sites. The atomic charge and spin population on the O-ads species indicate that it may not only act as an initiator for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also directly attack the organics on the pyrrolic N. On the N site and C site of the N4V2 system (quadri-pyridinic N with two vacancies) and the pyridinic N site at edge, O-3 could be activated into O-1(2) in addition to O-3(2). The N4V2 system was predicted to have the best activity among the N-DNCs studied. Based on the DFT results, machine learning models were utilized to correlate the O-3 activation activity with the local and global properties of the catalyst surfaces. Among the models, XGBoost performed the best, with the condensed dual descriptor being the most important feature.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000815705700001	35615937

Under the elevated CO2 conditions, a two-fold increase in the rate of the culture growth, which remained balanced in terms of carbon and nitrogen assimilation, was recorded. The cultivation at 20% CO2 did not disturb the ultrastructure or functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus of the microalgae. By contrast, the increase in saturating light intensity, quantum yield and the rates of oxygen evolution and CO2 fixation were recorded in comparison with cultivation at the atmospheric CO2. The analysis of photosystem I (PS I) reaction center, P-700, reduction revealed an increase in cyclic electron flow over PS I, a putative source of the extra ATP for the maintenance of cell pH homeostasis. This suggestion was supported by a characteristic expansion of the thylakoid lumen observed on electron micrographs. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors blocked the capability of the microalga to maintain a favorable culture pH at 20% CO2 suggesting the involvement of these enzymes in CO2 tolerance. It is emphasized that the robustness of photosynthetic carbon assimilation together with the efficient channeling of the photosynthates to the biosynthesis of the structural cell components is crucial for acclimation to and efficient growth under very high carbon dioxide levels. These capabilities make the symbiotic microalgae particularly suitable for employment in the advanced CO2 biomitigation technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The lattice orientations of the Au nanocubes match those of the Pd shells. Structural analysis establishes that the THH nanocrystals are bounded by high-index {73 0} facets. A substantial lattice mismatch between Au and Pd, oxidative etching in the presence of chloride and oxygen, the use of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) surfactant, and the reaction temperature (30-60 degrees C) were identified to be key factors facilitating the formation of the THH core shell nanocrystals. Intermediate products have also been examined to follow the growth process. By selecting cubic gold cores with sizes of 30-70 nm and varying the volume of the gold core solution used, THH Au Pd core shell nanocrystals with continuously adjustable sizes from 56 to 124 nm can be readily obtained. Their UV vis spectra display progressive red-shifted bands. Interestingly, novel concave octahedral and octahedral Au Pd core shell nanocrystals can be prepared by lowering the reaction temperature and prolonging the reaction time. The concave octahedra show depressions on all the {1 1 1} faces. Electrocatalytic activity of the three Au Pd core shell structures for the oxidation of ethanol has been investigated. The THH nanocrystals with entirely high-index {7 30} facets were found to exhibit the best electrocatalytic activity. These size-tunable THH Au-Pd core-shell nanocrystals may be valuable for catalyzing other organic reactions.									328	23	0	0	22	0	337			0002-7863			WOS:000283276800049	20873739

Quaternary PtPdAuTe NWs are designed via a facile template method, and NWs with a different composition are obtained by adjusting the feed ratio of metal precursors. The direct displacement reaction of metal precursors with Te NWs and the partial oxidation of Te lead to the formation of quaternary NWs. The rough surface and abundant reactive sites deriving from the rearrangement of metal atoms on the Te NWs surface endow the PtPdAuTe NWs with a superior electrocatalytic property and durability for methanol oxidation. The Pt20Pd20Au10Te50 NWs display the largest mass activity and best stability among all catalysts. The preparation of PtPdAuTe NWs could provide a viable strategy for the preparation of other multicomponent NWs.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000498949200001	31733030

Owing to the high specific surface area, well-defined active site, delimited void space, and tunable mass transfer rate, hollow nanostructures can serve as excellent catalysts, supports, and reactors for a variety of catalytic applications, including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, homogeneous catalysis, etc. Based on state-of-the-art synthetic methods and characterization techniques, researchers focus on the purposeful functionalization of hollow nanomaterials for catalytic mechanism studies and intricate catalytic reactions. Herein, an overview of current reports with respect to the catalysis of functionalized hollow nanomaterials is given, and they are classified into five types of versatile strategies with a top-down perspective, including textual and composition modification, encapsulation, multishelled construction, anchored single atomic site, and surface molecular engineering. In the detailed case studies, the design and construction of hierarchical hollow catalysts are discussed. Moreover, since hollow structure offers more than two types of spatial-delimited sites, complicated catalytic reactions are elaborated. In summary, functionalized hollow nanomaterials provide an ideal model for the rational design and development of efficient catalysts.									164	11	1	0	11	0	168			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000486253200006	30125990

Gas enters the sample due to buoyant upward convection. That is, ignition at the bottom produces an upwardly propagating filtration combustion wave which induces hot gas to rise, thus pulling cool, fresh gas containing oxidizer in through the bottom of the sample. The gas moves through the solid products to reach the reaction zone just as in forced forward filtration combustion. In contrast to forced forward filtration combustion, in which the incoming gas flux is fixed by an external source, here the incoming gas flux is determined by the combustion process itself. That is, the incoming gas flux is determined by the burning temperature which in turn is affected by the incoming gas flux. Thus, a feedback mechanism exists which hinders ignition of the samples, but also makes the wave hard to extinguish, once it has formed. A one-dimensional model is analyzed and two types of wave structure, termed reaction-leading and reaction-trailing according as the reaction occurs at the leading or trailing edge of the heated region of the sample, respectively, are determined. For each structure, two solution modes are described, termed stoichiometric and kinetically controlled, according as the rate of oxygen supply or the kinetics controls propagation of the wave. In each of these four situations, expressions are derived for the evolution of the burning temperature, propagation velocity, incoming gas flux, degree of oxidizer consumption and degree of fuel conversion as the wave moves through the sample. In addition, profiles for the temperature are described. Analysis of the case where significant heat is lost through the sides of the sample leads to extinction limits and demonstrates the sensitivity of the wave structure to changes in external heat losses.									16	0	1	0	0	0	17			0022-0833			WOS:A1997XJ40200007

Herein, we propose a new strategy based on intra-melon hydrogen bonding interactions in 2D CN frameworks to improve the crystallinity of CN. This concept was validated by removing some amino groups and connecting melon using codoped B and F atoms via a simple one-step sodium fluoroborate-assisted thermal treatment. The enhancement in crystallinity effectively promoted exciton dissociation and charge transfer in the CN nanosheets. Furthermore, the B/F dopants also improved the separation of photogenerated carriers by promoting charge capture. The highly efficient visible-light photocatalytic activity of the crystalline B/F-codoped CN nanosheets was demonstrated by degrading methyl orange, Rhodamine B, colorless phenol and tetracycline hydrochloride as models, where their degradation rate constant was more than 10, 5, 32 and 3 times higher than that of pure CN, respectively. Moreover, the B/F-codoped CN exhibited an excellent photoelectrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), outperforming the precious-metal IrO2 catalyst. The simple and effective strategy proposed herein provides a direct route to engineer high crystallinity in 2D materials for tunable charge carrier separation and migration for electronic and optoelectronic applications.									107	3	0	0	15	0	107			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000464454400038	30912790

In the process of successive CV scanning, the electrocatalytic activity of CFC toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) becomes better and better owing to Pt deposition on CFC, and after 1000 CV cycles, the onset potential of CFC is identical to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0 V, vs. RHE) with high current densities at low overpotentials (eta(10), eta(100), and eta(170) = 4.5, 34.5, and 43.5 mV at current densities of 10, 100 and 170 mA cm(-2)). Interestingly, it was found that as-prepared Pt/CFC exhibits decreased HER activity with an onset potential of -0.26 V (vs. RHE) when Pt mesh was changed to bare CFC as the counter electrode, mainly due to the lower Pt loading amount (0.5 mg cm(-2)) on CFC compared to commercial Pt/C (Pt loading amount of 1.0 mg cm(-2)) and the inert CFC counter electrode (not like the Pt mesh counter electrode with slight dissolution in acidic media during CV scanning). Generally, there is great competition between the HER from water splitting and hydrogenation reduction of organic matter using the same HER-active electrocatalyst under identical experimental conditions. In this work, Pt/CFC was, therefore, evaluated for hydrogenation reduction of p-nitrophenol (PNP) to p-aminophenol (PAP) using water as the hydrogen donor in a CFC counter electrode configurated two-compartment reaction system. The results demonstrate that PNP can be effectively converted into PAP with a conversion efficiency of 83.1% and a Faradaic efficiency of 9.9% after electrocatalytic reaction for 12 h at an overpotential of -0.023 V. The findings of this work indicate that Pt counter electrodes are prone to dissolving, resulting in Pt deposition on the working electrode in acidic media, readily causing the false appearance of a non-Pt working electrode with high HER activity. Additionally, the Pt-deposited working electrode produced by this electrochemical approach is efficient for hydrogenation reduction of organic substances into high value-added chemicals using water as the hydrogenation donor.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000406192800011

In the syn-gas production step, increase in Cu content in the CuxFe3-xO4/ZrO2 medium suppressed carbon deposition and enhanced the reaction rate for stoichiometries of x <= 0.7. In the water-splitting step, the addition of Cu promoted the gasification of the deposited carbon. Furthermore, the addition of Ce as a binder in the Cu0.7Fe2.3O4/Ce-ZrO2 medium also improved reactivity in the syn-gas production step and yielded the highest reactivity when the molar ratio of Ce/Zr was 3/1. As a result of the co-addition of Cu and Ce, the Cu0.7Fe2.3O4/Ce-ZyO(2) medium showed high durability, with a constant evolution of the synthesis gas and hydrogen in ten repeated cycles. It is thus expected that the Cu-ferrite/Ce-ZrO2 medium is favourable for two-step methane reforming. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In practice, however, large-scale electrochemical production of hydrogen from water splitting is greatly limited by water-oxidation reaction. CoSe2 and its composites with other compounds are efficient catalysts for water oxidation. Herein for the first time, we report that CoSe2 is converted to cobalt oxide when is used as a water-oxidizing catalyst under the electrochemical water oxidation condition at pH = 13. The results are very important for water-splitting systems, which use CoSe2 as a water-oxidizing catalyst. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism consists of types of reactions, each characterized by an approximate rate coefficient, including processes for ring formation (via H atom abstraction, C2H2 addition, and cyclization leading to ring closing), reactive coagulation of aromatic molecules, and cage closing via H-2 elimination and ring closing but also allowing for additional processes such as intramolecular rearrangements. Curved PAH, including benzo[ghi]fluoranthene (C18H10) and dibenzo-[ghi,mno]fluoranthene (corannulene, C20H10), are likely fullerene precursors. Corannulene is considered a key intermediate in the fullerene formation mechanism. Although alternatives to corannulene as an intermediate are mentioned, the proposed mechanism is based on corannulene and other related PAH of C5v symmetry. Trivial nomenclature for the C5v intermediates is also introduced. Preliminary kinetic testing of the mechanism, using approximate rate coefficients based on analogous flat PAH reactions, shows the mechanism to be plausible within the uncertainties of the rate coefficients and the experimental data on fullerenes formation rates. The predicted fullerene formation times extend over a range that includes the experimentally observed times, and the predicted C70/C60 ratio agrees well with flame data. Predicted fullerene formation rates are increased strongly by increased C2H2 and decreased H-2 concentrations and moderately by increased H atom concentrations. Similarities between growth species in flames and carbon vapor systems imply that much of the mechanism may be pertinent to fullerene formation in carbon vapor systems.									158	3	0	0	3	0	162			0022-3654			WOS:A1993MD08900018

Water Oxidation Catalysis Beginning with Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)(10-) When Driven by the Chemical Oxidant Ruthenium(III)tris(2,2 '-bipyridine): Stoichiometry, Kinetic, and Mechanistic Studies en Route to Identifying the True Catalyst								ACS CATALYSIS				4	1			79	89		10.1021/cs4006925				JAN 2014	2014	Stoichiometry and kinetics are reported for catalytic water oxidation to O-2 beginning with the cobalt polyoxometalate Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)(10-) (Co4POM) and the chemical oxidant ruthenium(III)tris(2,2'-bipyridine) (Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+)). This specific water oxidation system was first reported in a 2010 Science paper (Yin et al. Science 2010, 328, 342). Under standard conditions employed herein of 1.0 mu M Co4POM, 500 mu M Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+), 100 mu M Ru(II)(bpy)(3)(2+), pH 7.2, and 0.03 M sodium phosphate buffer, the highest O-2 yields of 22% observed herein are seen when Ru(II)(bpy)(3)(2+) is added prior to the Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+) oxidant; hence, those conditions are employed in the present study. Measurement of the initial O-2 evolution and Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+) reduction rates while varying the initial pH, [Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+)], [Ru(II)(bpy)(3)(2+)], and [Co4POM] indicate that the reaction follows the empirical rate law: -d[Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+)]/dt = (k(1) + k(2))[Co4POM](soluble)[Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+)]/[H+], where the rate constants k(1) similar to 0.0014 s(-1) and k(2) similar to 0.0044 s(-1) correspond to the water oxidation and ligand oxidation reactions, and for O-2 evolution, d[O-2]/dt = (k(1)/4)[Co4POM](soluble)[Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+)]/[H+]. Overall, at least seven important insights result from the present studies: (i) Parallel WOC and Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+) self-oxidation reactions well documented in the prior literature limit the desired WOC and selectivity to O-2 in the present system to <= 28%. (ii) The formation of a precipitate from similar to 2 Ru(II)(bpy)(3)(2+)/3 Co-4(H2O)(2)(PW9O34)(2)(10-) with a K-sp = (8 +/- 7) x 10(-25) (M-5) greatly complicates the reaction and interpretation of the observed kinetics, but (iii) the best O-2 yields are still when Ru(II)(bpy)(3)(2+) is preadded. (iv) CoOx is 2-11 times more active than Co4POM under the reaction conditions, but (v) Co4POM is still the dominant WOC under the Co4POM/Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+) and other reaction conditions employed. The present studies also (vi) confirm that the specific conditions matter greatly in determining the true WOC and (vii) allow one to begin to construct a plausible WOC mechanism for the Co4POM/Ru(III)(bpy)(3)(3+) system.									71	0	0	0	13	0	72			2155-5435			WOS:000329472600013

Such single-atom catalysts have relatively higher selectivity and catalytic activity with maximum atom utilization due to their unique characteristics of high metal dispersion and a low-coordination environment. However, freestanding single atoms are thermodynamically unstable, such that during synthesis and catalytic reactions, they inevitably tend to agglomerate to reduce the system energy associated with their large surface areas. Therefore, developing innovative strategies to stabilize single-atom catalysts, including mass-separated soft landing, one-pot pyrolysis, co-precipitation, impregnation, atomic layer deposition, and organometallic complexation, is critically needed. Many types of supporting materials, including polymers, have been commonly used to stabilize single atoms in these fabrication techniques. Herein, we review the stabilization strategies of single-atom catalyst, including different synthesis methods, specific metals and carriers, specific catalytic reactions, and their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, this review focuses on the application of polymers in the synthesis and stabilization of single-atom catalysts, including their functions as carriers for metal single atoms, synthetic templates, encapsulation agents, and protection agents during the fabrication process. The technical challenges that are currently faced by single-atom catalysts are summarized, and perspectives related to future research directions including catalytic mechanisms, enhancement of the catalyst loading content, and large-scale implementation are proposed to realize their practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2520-8489	2520-8136		WOS:000850105000001		
J	Bolzan, AE; Iwasita, T; Arvia, AJ								Combined voltammetry and in situ infrared spectroscopy of tetramethylthiourea on gold in aqueous acid solutions								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				51	6			1044	1058		10.1016/j.electacta.2005.05.043				NOV 25 2005	2005	The voltammetric behaviour of tetramethylthiourea (TMTU) dissolved in aqueous perchloric and sulphuric acid solutions on polycrystalline gold combined with in situ Fourier transform infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (FTIRRAS) was investigated. Conventional and triangular modulated voltammetry and rotating disc electrode data demonstrate the occurrence of two redox surface processes in the potential ranges -0.1 <= E <= -0.3 V and 0.7 <= E <= 0.8V (versus SHE), respectively. These processes would involve the participation of TMTU adsorbates. The redox surface process observed in the range -0.1 to -0.3 V can be related to the electrosorption of TMTU. The absence of infrared absorption bands from these adsorbates agrees with a flat, almost parallel adsorption of TMTU molecules on gold that has been already reported. In the range 0.4 V <= E <= 0.8 V both electrochemical and spectroscopic data indicate the anodic formation of soluble gold-TMTU complex and tetramethylformamidine disulphide (TMFDS2+) ions presumably via Au(TMTU)(+) adsorbates. The kinetics of soluble gold-TMTU complex ion formation is under diffusion control, whereas the formation of TMFDS2+ ions behaves as a rather irreversible process with the anodic slope, derived from current-potential curves, partial derivative E/partial derivative log I = 0.120 V decade(-1) at 298 K. At E > 1.2 V, the global electro-oxidation of both TMTU and TMFDS2+ species yields carbon dioxide, sulphate ions and carbonyl-containing compounds, as indicated by IR spectra. These reactions involve the participation of oxygen-containing adsorbates produced from water electro-oxidation on gold. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

After describing the best method for normalizing the net faradaic currents to the active surface area of the electrodes, we measure the HOR/HER kinetic parameters (exchange current densities and transfer coefficients) in a temperature range from 313 K to 353 K and calculate the activation energy for the HOR/HER process. We compare the measured kinetic parameters with those extracted from different mass-transport limitation free setups in literature, to evaluate the hydrogen electrocatalysis on these most active surfaces. The HOR/HER activity scales with the following: Pt > Ir >> Rh > Pd. The anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients are similar for all metals (ca. 0.5), leading to Tafel slopes of ca. 140 mV/decade at 353 K (except for the anodic branch of Pd and the cathodic branch of Rh). The lowest activation energies are found for Pt and Ir (approximate to 20 kJ/mol). For Rh and Pd, higher activation energies are found (approximate to 30 kJ/mol), and attributed to the formation of surface oxides and hydride phase, respectively. (C) The Author(s) 2014.

This reaction can lead to structural modifications and/or inactivation of proteins. Recent years have brought a wealth of new information on methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) which makes methionine oxidation a reversible process. Homologs of msrA and msrB genes have been identified in most living organisms and their evolution throughout different species led to different genetic organization and different copy number per organism. While MsrA and MsrB had been the focus of multiple biochemical investigations, our understanding of their physiological role in vivo remains scarce. Yet, the recent identification of a direct link between protein targeting and MsrA/MsrB repair offers a best illustration of the physiological importance of this pathway. Repeatedly identified as a potential "virulence factor", contribution of msrA to pathogenicity is also discussed. It remains, however, unclear whether reduced virulence results from overall viability loss or relates to specific oxidized virulence factors left unrepaired. We speculate that a major issue towards assessing the in vivo role of the MsrA/MsrB repair pathway in the next future will be to decipher the interrelations, if any, between MsrA/MsrB-mediated repair and chaperone-assisted folding and/or protease-assisted degradation.

Petroleum Processing Section				37	6			1479	1490	1001-8719(2021)37:6<1479:HKXPDJ>2.0.TX;2-3					2021	2021	Proton-exchange membrane(PEM)hydrogen production technology by water electrolysis through renewable energy power is one of the most effective methods for producing green hydrogen in a large scale at this stage,which is characterized by high work efficiency,high-purity hydrogen production,compact electrolytic cell and system structure,high intrinsic safety,large adjustable range of load fluctuation,and suitablity for quick start and stop.Anode reaction is a ratedetermining step,and the activity and stability as well as cost of anode catalyst are one of the important factors that currently restrict the large-scale development of hydrogen production by PEM water electrolysis.At present,the main commercial anode catalyst is IrO_2 or Ir-black catalyst,while iridium is expensive due to the small reserves.Therefore,it is imperative to find effective ways to reduce catalyst cost and improve catalyst performance.The Ir-M catalyst with core-shell structure makes use of the cooperative regulation of electronic effect and strain effect between the core and the shell,which not only can effectively reduce the use of the precious metal Ir,but also can significantly improve catalytic activity.This paper summarizes the main preparation methods for the Ir-based PEM anode catalyst with core-shell structure by water electrolysis,including colloidal method(seeded growth method),one-step synthesis method and selective de-alloying method,analyzes the reaction mechanism,describes the characterization methods specifically for the electrocatalyst with core-shell structure,and finally looks forward to the future research and development trends of the iridium-based core-shell structured catalyst.			基于可再生能源电力的质子交换膜(PEM)电解水制氢技术是现阶段大规模制取绿氢的有效方法之一,其具有工作效率高、制氢纯度高、电解槽及系统结构紧凑、本质安全性高、负荷波动可调节范围大、适合快速启停等优点。阳极反应是速率控制步骤,阳极催化剂的活性和稳定性以及成本是目前制约PEM电解水制氢大规模发展的重要因素之一,目前主要的阳极商业催化剂为IrO_2或Ir黑催化剂,Ir储量少且价格昂贵,因此当务之急是寻求能够同时降低催化剂成本和提高催化剂性能的有效方法。具有核-壳结构的Ir-M催化剂利用核与壳之间的电子效应和应变效应的协同调节,不仅可以降低贵金属Ir的用量,而且能显著提高催化活性,笔者综述了核-壳结构型Ir基PEM电解水制氢阳极催化剂的主要制备方法,包括胶体法(晶种生长法)、一步合成法、选择性脱合金法等,分析了反应机理,阐述了核壳结构电催化剂特用的表征方法,最后对Ir基核-壳结构催化剂的研究发展趋势做出了展望。						1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1001-8719			CSCD:7095592

To this end, system evolution was followed by UV-vis, HPLC, CG-MS, TOC and toxicity measurements. The effects of reaction conditions including initial pH, oxidants (O-2 and H2O2) concentrations, ZVI loading, and the presence of SO42- were studied. Mechanistic issues were addressed by following H2O2, Fe(II), Fe(III) and pH profiles, as well as by performing experiments in the presence of iron-complexing agents (o-phenanthroline and EDTA) or reactive species scavengers (2-propanol and DMSO).Results show that AB1 reduction occurs through heterogeneous processes with moderate to low pH dependent rates, whereas AB1 oxidation is ruled by the Fenton reaction with significantly pH dependent rates. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that AB1 decolorization in ZVI-assisted Fenton systems involves both oxidative and reductive pathways, whose relative contributions significantly change as the initial pH is raised from 3 to 5. In acidic media, AB1 is mostly transformed by oxidative pathways linked to H2O2 consumption. In contrast, in circumneutral media, a rather inefficient H2O2 consumption leads to similar contributions of oxidative and reductive AB1 transformation pathways. A detailed analysis of the pH dependence of the key reactions involved suggests that the overall system behavior is ruled by a shift in the oxidation mechanism of Fe(II) species, as a consequence of the development of a thigh corrosion layer onto ZVI particles at circumneutral pH values.									71	4	0	0	27	0	75			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000430762300006

The resulting artificial enzyme catalyzed sulfoxidation when irradiated with visible light in the presence of air. This reaction proceeds by initial electron abstraction from the sulfide within the enzyme active site, and the protein scaffold extended the fluorescence lifetime of the acridium cofactor. The mode of sulfide activation and placement of the acridinium cofactor (5) in POP-ZA(4)-5 make this artificial enzyme a promising platform for developing selective photocatalytic transformations.									12	0	0	0	6	0	12			1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000360492500008	26097041

The substances were investigated in aqueous NaClO4 solution and non-aqueous LiClO4/CH3CN solution by cyclic voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode. In aqueous solution, cyclam and Rac ligands being soluble in water undergo anodic oxidation. Coordination to Co(III) in complexes 1-4, stabilizes these ligands but reversible peaks in catohodic region indicate the redox reaction Co-III/Co-II ion. In the case of the binuclear Co(II) complexes 5-8, peaks recorded on die CVs represent oxidation of the bridged Rac ligand. The complexes examined influence the cathodic reaction of hydrogen evolution in aqueous solutions by shifting its potential to more negative values and its current is increased. In non-aqueous solution the CVs of the ligands show irreversible anodic peaks for cyclam. tpmc and for the Rac ligands soluble in acetonitrile. The absence of any peaks in the case of the investigated complexes 1-4 indicates that coordination to Co(III) stabilizes both the cyclam and Rac ligands. Cyclic voltammograms of the complexes 5-8 show oxidation processes of the Rac ligand and Co(II) ions but the absence of a highly anodic peak of the coordinated macrocycle tpmc shows its stabilization. Contrary to in aqueous solution, the redox reaction Co(III)/Co(II) does not occur in acetonitrate indicating a higher stability of the complexes 1-4 in this media in comparison with the binuclear cobalt(II)-tpmc complexes 5-8.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0352-5139			WOS:000188185700010

Experiments were conducted in either static mode to observe temporal evolution of reactants and products or in dynamic mode to ensure adequate collection of aerosol at reasonably low reactant concentrations. Although some measurements of gas-phase products have been made, the focus of this work has been particle phase analysis. To identify individual products, filter samples were extracted, derivatised and analysed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry techniques. The results indicate that secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is readily formed from SQT oxidation. The high reactivity of these systems and generally high conversion into SOA products gives rise to high SOA levels. SOA yields (ratio of SOA formed to hydrocarbon reacted) averaged 0.53 for ozonolysis, 0.55 for photooxidation and 1.19 for NO3 reactions. In select experiments, SOA was also analysed for the organic matter/organic carbon (OM/OC) ratio, and the effective enthalpy of vaporisation (Delta H-vap(eff)). The OM/OC ranged from 1.8 for ozonolysis and photooxidation reactions to 1.6 for NO3 reactions, similar to that from SOA generated in monoterpene systems. Delta H-vap(eff) was measured for beta-caryophyllene-NOx, beta-caryophyllene-O-3, beta-caryophyllene-NO3, alpha-humulene-NOx and alpha-farnesene-NOx systems and found to be 43.9, 41.1, 44.9, 48.2 and 27.7 kJ mol(-1). Aerosol yields and products identified in this study are generally in good agreement with results from several studies. A detailed examination of the chamber aerosol for the presence of chemical tracer compounds was undertaken. Only beta-caryophyllinic acid, observed mainly under beta-caryophyllene photooxidation and ozonolysis experiments, was detected in ambient aerosol. Chemical analysis yielded compounds having oxygen and nitrogen moieties present, which indicates continued evolution of the particles over time and presents high dependence on the SQT-oxidant system studied. This study suggests that SOA from laboratory ozonolysis experiments may adequately represent ambient aerosol in areas with SQT emissions.									48	1	0	0	10	0	48			1448-2517	1449-8979		WOS:000321064400006

In this work, we design and fabricate a novel interface catalyst of Ni and Co2N (Ni/Co2N) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The Ni/Co2N interfacial catalysts not only achieve a current density of -10.0 mA cm(-2) with an overpotential of 16.2 mV for HER but also provide a HOR current density of 2.35 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Furthermore, the electrode couple made of the Ni/Co2N interfacial catalysts requires only a cell voltage of 1.57 V to gain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for overall water splitting. Hybridizations in the three elements of Ni-3d, N-2p, and Co-3d result in charge transfer in the interfacial junction of the Ni and Co2N materials. Our density functional theory calculations show that both the interfacial N and Co sites of Ni/Co2N prefer to hydrogen adsorption in the hydrogen catalytic activities. This study provides a new approach for the construction of multifunctional catalysts for hydrogen electrochemistry.									14	3	0	0	0	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600044	32501672

This part of the protein is removed by the action of an endopeptidase, and the proteolytic processing is indispensable for the manifestation of oxygen-evolving activity in photosynthesis. The carboxyl-terminus of mature D1 protein, which appears upon the cleavage, has recently been demonstrated to be a ligand for a manganese atom in the Mn4Ca-cluster, which is responsible for the water oxidation chemistry in photosystem II, based on the isotope-edited Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the X-ray crystallography. On the other hand, the structure of a peptidase involved in the cleavage of precursor D1 protein has been resolved at a higher resolution, and the enzyme-substrate interactions have extensively been analyzed both in vivo and in vitro. The present article briefly summarizes the history of research and the present state of our knowledge on the carboxyl-terminal processing of precursor D1 protein in the photosystem II reaction center.									32	2	0	0	30	0	33			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000251426400003	17551844

D. Anbar et al., Science 317, 1903-1906 (2007); M. C. Koehler, R. Buick, M. E. Barley, Precambrian Res. 320, 281-290 (2019)], but the triggers for these short-lived events are so far unknown. Here, we use mercury (Hg) abundance and stable isotope composition to investigate atmospheric evolution and its driving mechanisms across the well-studied "whiff" of O-2 recorded in the similar to 2.5-Ga Mt. McRae Shale from the Pilbara Craton in Western Australia [A. D. Anbar et al., Science 317, 1903-1906 (2007)]. Our data from the oxygenated interval show strong Hg enrichment paired with slightly negative Delta Hg-199 and near-zero Delta Hg-200, suggestive of increased oxidative weathering. In contrast, slightly older beds, which were evidently deposited under an anoxic atmosphere in ferruginous waters [C. T. Reinhard, R. Raiswell, C. Scott, A. D. Anbar, T. W. Lyons, Science 326, 713-716 (2009)], show Hg enrichment coupled with positive Delta Hg-199 and slightly negative Delta Hg-200 values. This pattern is consistent with photochemical reactions associated with subaerial volcanism under intense UV radiation. Our results therefore suggest that the whiff of O-2 was preceded by subaerial volcanism. The transient interval of O-2 accumulation may thus have been triggered by diminished volcanic O-2 sinks, followed by enhanced nutrient supply to the ocean from weathering of volcanic rocks causing increased biological productivity.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0027-8424			WOS:000689727600013	34373333

Five families of compounds were studied: (i binary oxides of metals and nonmetals, (ii) ternary salts of inorganic oxo acids, (iii) concentrated or anhydrous oxo- acids, (iv) binary and ternary chlorides and (v) oxochlorides. At low temperatures up to 200 degrees C AgF2 readily oxidizes HgO, B2O3, PbO2, As2O5, Ag2SO4, LiBO2, K2CO3, KVO3, Ag2WO4, and AgMnO4 with concomitant oxygen evolution. In the same conditions V2O5, CrO3, MoO3, WO3, CuO, Tl2O3, I2O5, Re2O7, K2SO4, HgSO4, KSO3F, KNO3, KClO4, KIO4, BaCrO4, KMnO4 and KReO4 resist the action of AgF2 but many of these compounds get oxidized at higher temperatures (up to nearly 300 degrees C). Substantial inertness of sulfates, chromates, nitrates, perchlorates, permanganates and perrhenates suggests that one might attempt to synthesize salts of divalent silver with these anions. AgF2 vigorously reacts with H2SO4 (fuming, 30% SO3), HSO3Cl (100%), HClO4 (70%), and HNO3 (fuming, 100%) at room temperature yielding salts of Ag-I and O-2; for HClO4 and HNO3 pre-cooled to -35 degrees C metastable Perchlorate / nitrate complexes of Ag-II are obtained. Anhydrous HSO3F behaves similar to HSO3CF3 (see Part I of this series) yielding slow methathetical conversion of AgF2 without concomitant redox reaction.Majority of chlorides and oxochlorides studied (AgCl, AuCl3, KAuCl4, WCl6, WOCl4, MoOCl4, MoO2Cl2) react with AgF2 at temperatures below 160 degrees C. Reaction with SiCl4 (in contrast to CCl4) is violent and very exothermic at room temperature. Liquid CrO2Cl2 (at room temperature) and solid WO2Cl2 (UP to 180 degrees C) are kinetically inert to AgF2. We do not observe intercalation of AgF2 with various redox-inert oxo- and chloro- Lewis bases at the experimental conditions.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			0044-2313	1521-3749		WOS:000261236900026

Graphene-like sheets supported Fe-Co layered double hydroxides nanoflakes as an efficient electrocatalyst for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction, A green investigation								CHEMOSPHERE				299						134251	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134251				JUL 2022	2022	Herein, a nanohybrid material containing graphene-like sheets (GS) and Fe-Co layered double hydroxides nanoflakes (LDHs) was synthesized via simple two-step processes and named Fe-Co LDHs/GS. The Fe-Co LDHs/ GS nanohybrid was characterized by various techniques. Fe-Co LDHs nanoflakes were grown on GS in Fe-Co LDHs/GS nanohybrid. The electrochemical surface area of Fe-Co LDHs/GS nanohybrid was obtained 0.05 cm2 based on the Randles-Sevcik equation. The Fe-Co LDHs/GS nanohybrid was applied as an electrocatalyst of HER and OER in a 1.0 M KOH. The electrochemical performance of Fe-Co LDHs/GS nanohybrid was surveyed by several electrochemical methods, and long-term electrochemical stability. The onset potential, overpotential at 10 mA cm-1 current density, and Tafel slope for the Fe-Co LDHs/GS nanohybrid were obtained -0.33 V, -0.43 V (vs. RHE), and 122 mV dec- 1, respectively.

Identifying efficient catalysts that can accelerate the reversible formation and decomposition of the insulating carbonate products formed on the electrode remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, we atomically dispersed IrOx/Ir bi-phase particles as single-atom catalysts (SACs) on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) and introduced them to facilitate a reversible Li-CO2 reaction with Low overpotential and stable cycle performance for 120 cycles. The IrOx/Ir SACs were successfully minimized to an atomic scale of 4 angstrom and formed unique surface oxides via dangling bonds on the atomic Ir catalyst, enhancing the surface catalytic activities. The N sites doped on the carbon nanotubes increased the electronic conductivity and provided favorable nucleation sites for Ir Loading. The Li-CO2 cells employing IrOx/Ir SACs Loaded on NCNTs exhibited improved cell performance, reduced polarization, Lower charge transfer resistance, and higher stable cyclability compared to cells employing Larger-sized Ir particles on NCNTs. The reversible Li-CO2 reaction mechanism facilitated by the IrOx/Ir SAC-Loaded NCNT catalyst is explained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations that demonstrated that the bond of SACs with (Li+ + e(-)) is strong and forms products, whereas the bond with Li-2-CO3* is weak and evolves products reversibly. This strategy to atomically minimize noble metal catalysts may facilitate the realization of high-performance and economical Li-CO2 batteries to achieve carbon-negativity targets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000806888000001

The objective is to develop strategies that enhance CO2 reduction while suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We find that there exists a scaling relation between the binding energy of the catalyst to hydrogen and that to COOH, a key intermediate in the reduction of CO2 to CO; however, the M-H bond is stronger than the M-COOH bond, driving the reaction toward the HER rather than the reduction of CO2 to CO. This scaling relation holds even with axial ligation to the metal cation coordinated to the porphyrin ring. When 4f lanthanide or 5f actinide elements are used as the reactive center, the scaling relation still holds but the M-COOH bond is stronger than the M-H bond, and the reaction favors the reduction of CO2 to CO. By contrast, there is no scaling relation between the binding energy of the catalyst to H and that to OCHO, the key intermediate in CO2 reduction to formic acid. Interestingly, we find that coordination of a ligand to an unoccupied axial site can make the M-OCHO bond stronger than the M-H bond, resulting in preferential formic acid formation. This means that the axial ligand effectively enhances CO2 reduction to formic acid and suppresses the HER. Our DFT calculations have also identified several promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to HCOOH with almost zero overpotentials.									63	1	0	0	3	0	64			1932-7447			WOS:000361868400008

Water splitting driven by renewable resource-derived electricity and direct use of sunlight based on electrocatalytic and photocatalytic reactions are two promising ways for sustainable hydrogen production. The development and design of efficient electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for hydrogen production is one of the most challenging and demanding missions for today's scientists. In this review, the basic principle and performance evaluation parameters of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic hydrogen production are first introduced, followed by a comprehensive summary of the research progress in electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water splitting. Subsequently, special focus is put on the surface and interfacial regulation strategies of electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for improving their H-2 production performances from water splitting, including morphology regulation, doping and surface defects, heterojunction construction, and cocatalyst modification. Finally, we also point out that the development of advanced electrocatalysts have the important positive effect for the design of efficient photocatalysts due to the similar nature between the electrocatalysts and cocatalysts in photocatalysis (the active sites that facilitate charge transfer and reduce the reaction energy barrier) during water splitting. We hope that this review article can give some inspirations and guidance for the design of efficient electrocatalytic and photocatalytic water splitting systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of these materials is critically dependent on the electrochemical state of their surface. Here, we develop an embedded quantum-mechanical approach using the self-consistent continuum solvation model to predict the relation between band alignment, electrochemical stability, and photocatalytic activity taking into account the long-range polarization of the semiconductor electrode under electrical bias. Using this comprehensive model, we calculate the charge-voltage response of various reconstructions of a solvated SrTiO3 surface, revealing that interfacial charge trapping exerts primary control on the electrical response and surface stability of the photoelectrode. Our results provide a detailed molecular-level interpretation of the enhanced photocatalytic activity of SrTiO3 upon voltage-induced restructuring of the semiconductor-solution interface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2475-9953			WOS:000472005600010

The mass transfer processes are governed by reactive phase compositions, surface areas, water-rock ratios, reaction rates, and fluid residence times. Experimental dissolution of the vitric phase of the tuff was congruent with respect to Cl in the solid and produced reaction rates which obeyed a general Arrhenius release rate between 250 and 300-degrees-C. The O-18 differences between reacted and unreacted rock and fluids, and mass balances calculations involving Cl in the glass phase, produced comparable water-rock ratios of unity, confirming the importance of irreversible reaction of the vitric tuff. A fluid residence time of approximately 2 x 10(3) years, determined from fluid reservoir volume and discharge rates, is less than 0.2% of the total age of the hydrothermal system and denotes a geochemically and isotopically open system. Mass transfer calculations generally replicated observed reservoir pH, P(CO2), and P(O2) conditions, cation concentrations, and the secondary mineral assemblage between 250 and 300-degrees-C. The only extraneous component required to maintain observed calcite saturation and high P(CO2) pressures was carbon presumably derived from underlying Paleozoic limestones. Phase rule constraints indicate that Cl was the only incompatible aqueous component not controlled by mineral equilibrium. Concentrations of Cl in the reservoir directly reflect mass transport rates as evidenced by correlations between anomalously high Cl concentrations in the fluids and tuff in the Valles caldera relative to other hydrothermal systems in rhyolitic rocks.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0377-0273			WOS:A1992HN50400004

But, they have a weak concerning large output discharge. Oxygenevolution reaction(OER) and oxgen reduction reaction(ORR) in aqueous solution make a resultof a decrease of cell efficiency and life span. Therefore, to minimize the voltage drop frombetween OCV and charge/discharge voltage is key point. The problem should be solved throughdeveloping catalysts of high efficiency. In this study, we synthesized Pr1-x(Sr, Ca)xCoO3 powdersby citric method and then measured physical characteristics of each powder by XRD, SEM,TGA etc. We examined its electrochemical properties by the cathodic polarization, anodic polarizationand cyclic voltammogram. We achieved results that new catalysts showed better performancesthan existing La1-xSrxCoO3, La1-xCaxCoO3, ect. catalysts prepared in our lab.				아연공기이차전지는 고에너지밀도형이고 환경친화적이며 낮은 제조단가와 수용액계의 전해질 사용으로 다른 종류의 전지에 비해 매우 안전한 특성을 가진다. 하지만, 고출력 방전에 취약한 단점이있으며 수용액에서 산소발생 및 환원반응은 매우 높은 과전압 하에서 일어나 전지효율의 감소및 수명단축의 결과를 가져온다. 따라서 충Â·방전이 개시되면서 초기 OCV로부터 전압강하를 최소화 시키는 것이 성능 개선의 관건인데 이는 고성능의 촉매개발로 해결해야 한다. 본 연구에서는구연산법을 이용하여 Pr1-x(Sr, Ca)xCoO3분말을 합성하고 각 분말들의 물성을 XRD, SEM,TGA 등을 이용하여 측정하고, 이를 이용한 양극의 환원 및 산화분극과 순환전압전류 등의 전기화학적 특성을 평가하여 기존에 연구했던 La1-xSrxCoO3, La1-xCaxCoO3 등의 촉매 성능보다 향상된결과를 얻을 수있었다.					1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1229-1935			KJD:ART001393574

Characterization methods for the photocatalyst included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The XRD patterns of the composite photocatalyst before and after visible-light irradiation demonstrated that trace amounts of Ag ions in the composite photocatalyst easily transformed into Ag nanoparticles, which play a role in promoting charge separation at the interface of a heterojunction. The UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 composite photocatalyst showed higher photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) under visible-light irradiation (>420 nm) than Ag3PO4. The complete degradation of 2-CP was achieved in 7 min using the tetrahedral UMOFNs/Ag3PO4 core-shell photocatalyst, and the apparent reaction rate was approximately 26 times higher than that of pure Ag3PO4. Further, a scavenger experiment showed h(+) and O-2(center dot-) were the major reactive species involved in the photocatalytic reaction system. This enhanced photocatalytic activity results from the efficient separation of photoinduced electron-hole pairs and the increase of interface area between Ag3PO4, UMOFNs, and the Ag nanoparticles.									11	2	0	0	1	0	12			2470-1343			WOS:000489241700024	31592468

Arnold discovered many phenomena in photosynthesis. In 1932, together with Robert Emerson, he provided the first experimental data that led to the concept of a large antenna and a few reaction centers (photosynthetic unit); in 1935, he obtained the minimum quantum requirement of 8-10 for the evolution of one O-2 molecule; in 1951, together with Bernard L. Strehler, he discovered delayed fluorescence (also known as delayed light emission) in photosynthetic systems; and in 1956, together with Helen Sherwood, he discovered thermoluminescence in plants. He is also known for providing a solid-state picture of photosynthesis. Much has been written about him and his research, including many articles in a special issue of Photosynthesis Research (Govindjee et al. (eds.) 1996); and a biography of Arnold, by Govindjee and Srivastava (William Archibald Arnold (1904-2001), 2014), in the Biographical Memoirs of the US National Academy of Sciences, (Washington, DC).

The modified iron oxides were prepared by co-precipitation method using urea precipitant. The role of additives was also examined using XRD and SEM analysis in detail. As a result, Pd, Pt, Rh and Ru additives have an effect on promoting the reduction and lowering the re-oxidation temperature of iron oxide. Especially, it is revealed that the effect of Rh species on lowering the reduction temperature is attributed to decrease of activation energy for H-2 reduction according to Fe2O3 -> Fe3O4 course. Meanwhile, Al, Ce, Ti and Zr additives played an important role in prevention of deactivation of iron oxide by repeated redox cycles. Redox performances of iron oxides were also enhanced due to cooperative effects by co-addition of Rh and another species such as Al, Cc and Zr. Finally, Fe-O/(Rh, Ce, Zr) sample exhibited good performance for H-2 evolution by water-splitting through synergistic effect of component additives.

To investigate the active site of CsTaWO6 for hydrogen generation and to understand the effects of the two d(0) elements in the compound, systematic and successive element substitution of tantalum and tungsten on the crystallographic 16c sites of the starting material has been performed. Substituting lattice tantalum with niobium hardly changes the band gap of the resulting compounds CsTa(1-x)NbxWO6, but the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation and oxidation reactions is strongly influenced. By investigating the surface reactivity toward adsorption, surface effects altering the activity are identified. In contrast, substituting lattice tungsten with molybdenum reduces the band gap of CsTaWO6 into the visible-light range. Materials containing Mo are however not able to generate hydrogen anymore, due to the altered conduction band positions proven by density functional theory calculations. CsTaMoO6 exhibits a band gap of 2.9 eV and evolves oxygen efficiently under UV light irradiation after CoPi co-catalyst deposition, and even under visible light small amounts of oxygen.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000349629600010

Here we report a controllable method to manipulate its electron spin polarization by tuning the concentration of Ti vacancies. The characterizations confirm the emergence of spatial spin polarization among Ti-defected TiO2, which promotes the efficiency of charge separation and surface reaction via the parallel alignment of electron spin orientation. Specifically, Ti0.936O2, possessing intensive spin polarization, performs 20-fold increased photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and 8-fold increased phenol photodegradation rates, compared with stoichiometric TiO2. Notably, we further observed the positive effect of external magnetic fields on photocatalytic activity of spin-polarized TiO2, attributed to the enhanced electron-spin parallel alignment. This work may create the opportunity for tailoring the spin-dependent electronic structures in metal oxides.									128	8	1	0	12	0	130			2041-1723			WOS:000511941200008	31964887

With the emergence of the research hotspot of TMPs, probing their mechanism of catalytic energy conversion and storage inspired by the superb structure of metal-phosphorus chelate is of great significance. To this end, recent developments in TMPs with various crystal structures and morphologies have attracted much attention. The design of TMPs ranging from the choice of different transition metals to phosphorus sources has been intensively explored. This research has indicated that multidimensional morphologies of TMPs prominently enrich the patterns of charge storage and electron transportation, and ultra-nanoscaled TMPs obtained by multiple tools and techniques might challenge the threshold of electrocatalytic reactions. Here, recent developments in synthetic strategies of TMPs from different precursors are classified. The underlying mechanism between the structural and crystallographic characteristics and the tuned properties of TMPs in energy applications is also presented. Additionally, the key trends in structure and morphology characterization of TMPs are highlighted. Future perspectives on the challenges and opportunities facing TMPs catalysts are thereby proposed.									372	18	0	0	8	0	379			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000379314700004

Here, in-situ generated hierarchical NiS-PBA/ CNT hybrid has been fabricated which combined the high conductivity and electrocatalytic activity together. Through study the electronic structure, it was found that the electron transfer among metal atom enable higher activity. The optimized NiS-PBA/CNT delivers an ultralow overpotential of 253 mV @ 20 mA cm-2, a small Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec-1, and can work steadily for more than 40 h with a Faradic efficiency of 95.5%. Density functional theory calculations based on the NiS-PBA, NiS and PBA model reveal that the enhanced catalytic activities of NiS-PBA is mainly manifested in its lower free energy of rate-determining step (the oxidation of *OH to *O) and higher electrical conductivity. This work provides a novel partial sulfidation strategy for PBA to significantly boost catalytic performance. And the microwave-assisted solvothermal reaction offers a novel mild implementation toward in situ heterogeneous doping for carbon matrix.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663673200001

The noble metals such as platinum are generally the most frequently used electrocatalysts to drive these reactions and facilitate the relevant energy conversion processes. The high cost and scarcity of these materials pose a serious challenge for the wide-spread adoption and the sustainability of these technologies in the long run, which have motivated considerable efforts in searching for alternative electrocatalysts with reduced loading of precious metals or based entirely on earth-abundant metals. Of particular interest are graphene-supported single atom catalysts (G-SACs) that integrate the merits of heterogeneous catalysts and homogeneous catalysts, such as high activity, selectivity, stability, maximized atom utilization efficiency and easy separation from reactants/products. The graphene support features a large surface area, high conductivity and excellent (electro)-chemical stability, making it a highly attractive substrate for supporting single atom electrocatalysts for various electrochemical energy conversion processes. In this review, we highlight the recent advancements in G-SACs for electrochemical energy conversion, from the synthetic strategies and identification of the atomistic structure to electrocatalytic applications in a variety of reactions, and finally conclude with a brief prospect on future challenges and opportunities.									258	22	0	0	17	0	260			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000490478500003	31573024

Seven different morphologies of WO3 ranging from 1 to 3D nanostructures were synthesized and subjected to HER under extreme pH conditions. The kinetic performance of 1D - nanorods of WO3 outperformed all its counterpart electrocatalysts with an exceptional Tafel slope of 96 and 105 mV dec(-1) at pH = 0 and 14 respectively. The very high aspect ratio of WO3 nanorods in conjunction with an excellent specific surface area by precision tailoring of the crystallographic facets along the (0 0 1) direction enabled better adsorption energies necessary for HER. The nanorod structures of WO3 were further screened by Stainless steel (SS) and Carbon cloth (CC) substrates to determine their efficacy as a real-time electrode for hydrogen production. The nanorods deposited on CC in acidic media displayed an outstanding endurance of 12 h under a static overpotential of -0.5 V vs. RHE and a striking Tafel slope of 76 mV dec(-1) comparable with standard Pt/C. The intrinsic interface of CC compared to SS along with the inherent complexity of WO3 nanorods has enriched the overall kinetic performance required for hydrogen evolution. This research has a promising scope for engineering the morphology and phase structure of WO3 metal oxide at the molecular level for boosting the interfacial active sites required for large scale production of hydrogen.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000714680200002

Cationic mobility with a suitable activation energy in Cr spinels is Tn. evidenced by theoretical and experimental results, while redox potentials of V are appropriate to operate with currently limited candidates of '''c" nonaqueous electrolytes. By controlling the structure, composition, and complexity, a largely solid-solution MgCrVO4 spinel was synthesized, which, unlike nanocornposites, can bring together the advantages of each transition metal in the lattice. The spinel was successfully synthesized by a simple solid-state reaction with minor inactive Cr- or V-rich components, which was confirmed via Mg-25 MAS NMR and high-resolution X-ray diffraction analyses. A thermally and anodically stable Mg(TPFA)(2)/triglyme electrolyte was utilized for high-temperature electrochemistry and lowering kinetic barriers at and across interfaces so as to observe intercalation behavior of Mg in the designed lattice. Multimodal characterization confirmed an apparent bulk demagnesiation from MgCrVO4 with partial reversibility by probing evolution of the local and long-range structure as well as vanadium and chromium electronic states within the lattice. Characterization experiments also provided a direct evidence for (de)intercalation reactions that occurred without any major competitive conversion reactions or insertion of protons into the lattice, except for the formation of a surface rock salt phase upon charge. These findings in Mg-ion activity expand opportunities to design Mg spinel oxide materials while highlighting the need to identify the origins of reversibility challenges due to, but not limited to, phase stability, particularly for the charged states, barriers at the interface, electrolyte stabilities, and desolvation phenomena, collectively hindering practical use as cathode materials.									21	1	0	0	2	0	22			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000513299400022		
J	Xu, Xiu-qiang; Wang, Yong-gang; Chen, Zong-ding; Chen, Xu-jun; Zhang, Hai-yong; Bai, Lei; Zhang, Shu								Variations in char structure and reactivity due to the pyrolysis and in-situ gasification using Shengli brown coal								JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL AND APPLIED PYROLYSIS				115				233	241		10.1016/j.jaap.2015.08.001				SEP 2015	2015	The initial reacting environment (such as temperature) could be highly important for determining the properties of char that is formed almost instantly when coal is fed into a hot gasifier. To fundamentally examine this issue, a new two-stage quartz reactor was specially designed, in which the heat treatment for the initial decomposition of Chinese Shengli brown coal particles could be separately and flexibly controlled. The chars generated from coal decomposition at the first stage were either taken out for analysis, or directly entered the second stage of reactor for in-situ gasification in steam. The results indicate that the change in initial heating conditions could impact the char reactivity in both steam and air. Particularly, 600 degrees C during the pyrolysis stage was a critical point for determining the subsequent char reactivity, especially in air. The porous structure of chars produced from the first stage of reactor was largely dependent on the treating temperature, the variation of which was diminished during the following second stage reaction in steam. The effects of temperature and holding time on carbon structure of chars at the first stage were tremendous. The difference in carbon structure (i.e., ratio of small to large aromatic ring systems) resulted from the pyrolysis was important for its reactivity in the following char-steam and char-oxygen reactions. Besides, the reaction mechanism of the preferential consumption of small aromatic ring systems during char-steam gasification may not always be the same as what the literatures have suggested, but is very much dependent on the nature of char.

Full water splitting, that is, decomposing water into H(2)and O(2)in stoichiometric amounts and with an acceptable activity, still remains a challenge, even when TiO2-based photocatalysts are used in combination with noble-metal co-catalysts. The bottleneck of anatase-type TiO(2)remains the water oxidation, that is, the hole transfer reaction from pristine anatase to the aqueous environment. In this work, we report that "grey" (defect engineered) anatase can provide a drastically enhanced lifetime of photogenerated holes, which, in turn, enables an efficient oxidation reaction of water to peroxide via a two-electron pathway. As a result, a Ni@grey anatase TiO(2)catalyst can be constructed with an impressive performance in terms of photocatalytic splitting of neutral water into H(2)and a stoichiometric amount of H(2)O(2)without the need of any noble metals or sacrificial agents. The finding of long hole lifetimes in grey anatase opens up a wide spectrum of further photocatalytic applications of this material.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000559452500001

This novel tandem type structure enables strong hydroxyl adsorption on CoO and moderated hydrogen adsorption on Co and therefore promotes the dissociation of water and the recombination of hydrogen intermediates into molecular hydrogen, respectively, and both act synergistically to catalyze the HER reaction. As a result, the current densities were up to 1.3 A cm-2 at only 173 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH and 379 mV in 1.0 M PBS solution, respectively. The high rate H2 production of 4.35 ml min-1 at - 1.18 V (vs. SCE) and the outstanding performance of 10 A lasting for more than 800 h in a MEA electrolyzer both indicate the prospect for the usage in practical.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000827643700001

However, significant challenges related to reversible charge/discharge of these cells need to be solved. The discharge reaction is generally agreed to proceed via two main routes, which may occur simultaneously. These are the surface mechanism, leading to Li2O2 product formation as surface films, or the solution mechanism, with solid particles formed in the pore structure of the cathode. A detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and the dynamic performance of the electrodes is key to further improvements. Here, we present a mathematical model for the discharge process, based on porous electrode theory, including effects of reactant transport and kinetic limitations, as well as the continuous change of properties due to the formation of reaction products via the solution mechanism and the surface mechanism. The model describes the dynamic change in the ratio of the surface and solution mechanism as a function of growth of film thickness, in line with recent findings. The model is able to predict the differences in experimentally obtained discharge curves between dimethyl sulfoxide and tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether solvents with 1M LiTFSI, with a minimum of free parameters. The model parameters are based on physical characterization of the materials and the electrodes, or determined by fitting to impedance spectra recorded during the discharge. The developed model and the methodology will provide a powerful tool for optimization of such electrodes.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000659049800002

Nowadays there are fixed clinical PDT protocols that make use of a particular optical dose, photosensitizer amount and drug-light interval. However the treatment response varies depending on the type of pathology and the patient. In order to adjust current dosimetry to get an optimal treatment outcome, the development of accurate predictive models has emerged as the ideal tool to achieve new personal protocols. Several attempts have been made in this way although the influence of the photosensitizer distribution on the optical parameters has not been taken into account until this moment. We present a first approach to predict the spatial-temporal variation of the absorption coefficient during the photodynamic process applied to a dermatological disease taking into account the photobleaching of a topical photosensitizer. The model presented also takes into account an inhomogeneous initial distribution of the photosensitizer, the propagation of light in the biological media and the evolution of the molecular concentrations of different components involved in the photochemical reactions. The obtained results permit us to investigate how the depletion of the photosensitizer during the photochemical reactions affects to the light absorption as it propagates within the target tissue.

Proceedings of the SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering				5937				59370Q	1-10		10.1117/12.624135				2005	2005	Poly(p-Phenylene Vinylene) derivatives are synthesized mostly making use of the polymerization behavior of p-quinodimethane systems. Over the last forty years different synthetic routes have been developed, e.g. Wessling, Gilch, Xanthate and Sulphinyl route. For all these routes mechanistic studies are rather scarce and lead to a controversy between two possible mechanisms: anionic and radical polymerization. In this contribution it becomes clear that high molecular weight materials are associated with a self-initiated radical chain polymerization and low molecular weight materials are obtained via an anionic mechanism. This will be demonstrated for the model system in which a sulphinyl pre-monomer is polymerized in N-Methyl-Pyrrolidone. In this model system both these mechanisms are competing with each other. The observed effects on the product distribution of concentration of reagents, temperature and order in which the reagents are added, are consistent with the conclusion above. The question whether living polymerization can occur will be addressed for the radical mechanism. An experiment with a set of sequential polymerizations gives rise to an evolution of molecular weight consistent with the effect of simple dilution of the reaction medium. The conclusion is that a termination reaction is active, which can be identified as related to traces of oxygen. In these conditions the synthesis of block-type copolymers can not be achieved. For the anionic mechanism an argumentation against such possibility will be presented on the basis of relative acidities.

By categorizing the confinement effects into the precursor self-confinement, nanospace confinement, and chemical binding atomic confinement with representative examples, we systematically introduced the confinement strategies in the synthesis of well-defined structures from the macroscopic to nanoscopic and atomic level. (1) Precursor self-confinement strategy. The electrode with a macroscopic hierarchical micro/nanoarray structure provides a large exposed surface area and structural merits for highly intensive electron transport and mass transfer as well as prompt gas release, which enables high-performance electrocatalytic energy devices. The self-confinement effect from the presynthesized precursors promises to rationally design and precisely fabricate such electrodes at the macroscopic level. (2) Nanospace confinement strategy. Metal dusters and nanoparticles (NPs) offer diverse surface sites for the adsorption, activation, and transformation of reactants/intermediates. The confinement from nanospaces such as OD nanopores, 1D nanochannels, 2D interlayer spaces, and 3D interconnected nanochannels enables the synthesis of nanoclusters and NPs with controlled morphologies and structures at the nanoscopic level, allowing for investigating the collective activation of intermediates, interaction with support, size-dependent structure-performance relationship. etc. (3) Chemical binding atomic confinement strategy. The chemical binding confinement makes it possible to synthesize single atom catalysts (SACs) with the capability of delicately tailoring their electronic structure and chemical environment at the atomic level, providing opportunities for in-depth understanding the underlying catalytic processes and the structure-performance relationships. (4) Integrated confinement strategy. Taking all these confinement effects into account together is powerful to mitigate the challenges in the synthetic fields such as well-defined high-density SACs. With these insights, this Account proposes the remaining challenges and possible solutions for the precise synthesis of next-generation well-defined electrocatalysts from macroscopic to atomic level by exploring suitable confinement effects and integrating them with other techniques, which may open up opportunities for bridging the gap between the fundamental research and industrial applications.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				2643-6728		WOS:000711029400007

It was found that C-2 hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds such as benzene and naphthalene were catalytically obtained with a considerable evolution of hydrogen. High methane conversion (8-12%) and rates of benzene formation obtained on the Re/HZSM-5 catalyst were similar, under the experimental conditions used, to that on Mo/HZSM-5, which has been thought to be a unique catalyst for the reaction. In contrast to the molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) as the active phase for the reaction on Mo/HZSM-5, EXAFS and TG/DTA/mass studies suggest that the metallic Re on HZSM-5 is responsible for the catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane toward C2 hydrocarbons, benzene, and naphthalene. High and stable conversion of methane and high selectivities (70-87% based on carbon) of C-2 hydrocarbons and benzene have been attained in the catalytic dehydrocondensation of methane on Re/HZSM-5 with CO/CO2 added in methane feed.

Prior to coupling the electrodes, both electrodes are examined for the generation kinetics and current efficiency of reactive oxygen species as well as the decomposition kinetics and total organic carbon (TOC) removal of phenol, as a function of applied half-potential (E ss or E cNT ) and the purging gas. Regardless of the purging gas, a stepwise increase in E ss enhances the OH center dot generation and phenol decomposition, yet inversely decreases the current efficiency of OH center dot (max. similar to 30%), owing to competitive O-2 evolution. Similar to this, the current efficiency of H2O2 is high at a less negative EcNT, reaching 80% with O-2 purging. However, phenol decomposition with CNT is trivial, owing to the limited reactivity between H2O2 and phenol. With N-2 purging, H2O2 is not produced nor is phenol decomposed. Compared to the sum of the performance of the two half-electrodes, the SS/CNT pair exhibits similar OH' generation kinetics regardless of the purging gas, yet significantly enhanced H2O2 generation kinetics. The phenol decomposition and TOC removal with the pair are more than double their sums of the two half-electrodes at all E cell s with O-2 purging, whereas such a synergistic effect is found only at high E cell s when N-2 is purged. The simultaneous evolution of O-2 microbubbles appears to create an in situ oxic environment between the SS and CNT, leading to a synergistic effect through the production of H2O2, even under anoxic and anoxic-like conditions.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000450105700048

Stability testing of the catalyst over a 1000 h continuous reaction at 600 degrees C resulted in deactivation by similar to 20% of the initial activity. Kinetic analysis of the activity versus time-on-stream indicated that the observed deactivation behavior can be divided into an induction period (<= 100 h) and an acceleration period (>100 h). The deactivation is mainly caused by the vaporization loss of active components (Cs and V) from the molten phase. At the earliest stage, most vapor is generated in the upstream section of the catalyst bed and then redeposits therebelow. Upon repeating these vaporization and deposition cycles, Cs and V move gradually downstream. During this induction period, the deactivation is not obvious because the total Cs and V content of the catalyst bed remains almost unchanged. After this period, however, detachment of Cs and V from the downstream end of the catalyst bed induces accelerated deactivation. The vaporization loss was found to be significantly suppressed by inverting the catalyst bed every 100 h during the stability test. Consequently, this operation reduced the extent of catalyst deactivation from 20% to less than 10% of the initial activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000458705500033		
J	Zhang, Runkun; Li, Gongke; Hu, Yufei								Simple and Excellent Selective Chemiluminescence-Based CS2 On-Line Detection System for Rapid Analysis of Sulfur-Containing Compounds in Complex Samples								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				87	11			5649	5655		10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00722				JUN 2 2015	2015	To study the interesting chemical reaction phenomenon can greatly contribute to the development of an innovative analytical method. In this paper, a simple CL reaction cell was constructed to study the chemiluminescence (CL) emission from the thermal oxidation of carbon disulfide (CS2). We found that the CL detection of CS2 exhibits unique characteristics of excellent selectivity and rapid response capacity. Experimental investigations together with theoretical calculation were performed to study the mechanism behind the CL reaction. The results revealed that the main luminous intermediates generated during the thermal degradation of CS2 are SO2* and CO2*. Significantly, this CL emission phenomenon has a wide application due to many sulfur-containing compounds that can convert to CS2 under special conditions. On the basis of this scheme, a CS2-generating and detection system was developed for rapid measurement of CS2 or other compounds that can convert to CS2. The usefulness of the system was demonstrated by measuring dithiocarbamate (DTC) pesticides (selected mancozeb as a representative analyte) based on the evolution of CS2 in spiked agricultural products. Results showed that the system allows online and large volume detection of CS2 under nonequilibrium condition, which greatly reduces the analytical time. The concentrations of mancozeb in the spiked samples were well-quantified with satisfied recoveries of 76.9-97.3%. The system not only addresses the urgent need for rapid in-field screening of DTC residues in foodstuffs but also opens a new opportunity for the fast, convenient, and cost-effective detection of CS2 and some other sulfur-containing compounds in complex samples.									23	2	0	0	3	0	25			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000355779500030	25913203

It has been established that the oxidative dissolution is governed primarily by a reaction involving reduction of Co(III) to Co(II) ions. The reduction of oxygen was also found to make a significant but largely indirect contribution to the kinetics of the dissolution process.The dissolution rates of various iron-nickel-cobalt-copper alloys which simulate the dissolving alloy particles in a Caron plant were measured in synthetic leach solutions under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The initial dissolution rates of iron, nickel and the iron alloys were found to increase in the presence of thiosulphate, whereas the thiosulphate had a negative effect on the dissolution rates of cobalt and copper. It is shown that the eventual passivation of the iron occurs sooner in solutions rich in Co(II) ions. Whilst these conditions are present in the quench slurry, on-site measurements have shown that due to the very high concentration of reduced dissolved species, passivation does not occur until the slurry is strongly aerated.In the light of these fundamental findings, options for optimizing the rate of dissolution and minimizing the extent of passivation of the iron and iron alloys are discussed.

Noble metal catalysts are widely used to improve the efficiency of DLFCs. However, the high cost, low utilization and poor stability of noble metals restricted their practical applications. Therefore, it is of great significance to explore cost-effective electrocatalysts and further improve their electrocatalytic performance. Reducing the content of noble metals by adding low-priced phosphorus (P) has been considered as an effective strategy, which is able to enhance their electrocatalytic activity and anti-poisoning ability through effectively changing the electronic density of active sites. In the past few years, tremendous P containing catalysts have been synthesized and utilized in DLFCs. In this review, we summarize the fundamentals of electrochemical reactions and present recent progress in P containing noble metal catalysts for DLFCs, including the discussion of their shape, composition and the relationship between P and active sites. Finally, the challenges and some potential directions in this field are pointed out.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000698217300001	34549765

With regards to the uncontrollable metal-ratio in recycled material, for the first time, the metal ratio of the Li-Ni-Co-Mn oxides' influence on their electrochemical performance is studied. In thermal treatment, the atmosphere is newly evaluated as a determining factor, while factors like temperature and time are also further compared. The mechanism of the lattice change resulted from the reductive decomposition reaction of LixCoO2 (x not equal 1) (alpha-NaFeO2-type), generating Co3O4 (spinel) is introduced. Finally, the recycled material is innovatively applied to CO2 electrolysis as anode OER catalyst with high current efficiency (97%) towards CO production under a total current density of 32 mA cm(-2) at 2.25 V, with an energy efficiency of 63%, which shows a promising future in the industry use.

Based on different contributions towards the solar-to-hydrogen efficiency, we mainly review the strategies to enhance the light absorption, facilitate the charge separation, and enhance the surface charge injection. Although great achievements have been obtained, the challenges faced in the development of anode materials for solar energy to make water splitting remain significant. In this review, the major challenges to improve the conversion efficiency of photoelectrochemical water splitting reactions are presented.

This Review discusses how ion insertion enables reversible transformation and switching of physico-chemical properties, the role of defects and interfacial reactions, and opportunities for ultrafast ionic control.Electrochemical ion insertion involves coupled ion-electron transfer reactions, transport of guest species and redox of the host. The hosts are typically anisotropic solids with 2D conduction planes but can also be materials with 1D or isotropic transport pathways. These insertion compounds have traditionally been studied in the context of energy storage but also find extensive applications in electrocatalysis, optoelectronics and computing. Recent developments in operando, ultrafast and high-resolution characterization methods, as well as accurate theoretical simulation methods, have led to a renaissance in the understanding of ion-insertion compounds. In this Review, we present a unified framework for understanding insertion compounds across timescales and length scales ranging from atomic to device levels. Using graphite, transition metal dichalcogenides, layered oxides, oxyhydroxides and olivines as examples, we explore commonalities in these materials in terms of point defects, interfacial reactions and phase transformations. We illustrate similarities in the operating principles of various ion-insertion devices, ranging from batteries and electrocatalysts to electrochromics and thermal transistors, with the goal of unifying research across disciplinary boundaries.									31	0	0	0	2	0	31			2058-8437			WOS:000653598000004		
J	Shikama, K; Matsuoka, A								Structure-function relationships in unusual nonvertebrate globins								CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				39	4			217	259		10.1080/10409230490514008				JUL-AUG 2004	2004	Based on the literature and our own results, this review summarizes the most recent state of nonvertebrate myoglobin (Mb) and hemoglobin (Hb) research, not as a general survey of the subject but as a case study. For this purpose, we have selected here four typical globins to discuss their unique structures and properties in detail. These include Aplysia myoglobin, which served as a prototype for the unusual globins lacking the distal histidine residue; midge larval hemoglobin showing a high degree of polymorphism; Tetrahymena hemoglobin evolved with a truncated structure; and yeast flavohemoglobin carrying an enigmatic two-domain structure. These proteins are not grouped by any common features other than the fact they have globin domains and heme groups. As a matter of course, various biochemical functions other than the conventional oxygen transport or storage have been proposed so far to these primitive or ancient hemoglobins or myoglobins, but the precise in vivo activity is still unclear.In this review, special emphasis is placed on the stability properof the heme-bound O-2. Whatever the possible roles of nonvertebrate myoglobins and hemoglobins may be (or might have been), binding of molecular oxygen to iron(H) must be the primary event to manifest their physiological functions in vivo. However, the reversible and stable binding of O-2 to iron(II) is not a simple process, since the oxygenated form of Mb or Hb is oxidized easily to its ferric met-form with the generation of superoxide anion. The metmyoglobin or methemoglobin thus produced cannot bind oxygen and is therefore physiologically inactive. In this respect, protozoan ciliate myoglobin and yeast flavohemoglobin are of particular interest in their very unique structures. Indeed, both proteins have been found to have completely different strategies for overcoming many difficulties in the reversible and stable binding of molecular oxygen, as opposed to the irreversible oxidation of heme iron(II). Such comparative studies of the stability of MbO(2) or HbO(2) are of primary importance, not only for a full understanding of the globin evolution, but also for planning new molecular designs for synthetic oxygen carriers that may be able to function in aqueous solution and at physiological temperature.									23	0	0	0	19	1	25			1040-9238	1549-7798		WOS:000224961200002	15596552

Although this contamination can change the morphology and properties of the consolidated materials, there is a lack of detailed information about the behavior of oxygen in nanocrystalline alloys. In this study, aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and associated techniques are used to investigate the behavior of oxygen during in situ heating of highly strained Cu-Fe alloys. Contrary to expectations, oxide formation occurs prior to the decomposition of the meta-stable Cu-Fe solid solution. This oxide formation commences at relatively low temperatures, generating nanosized clusters of firstly CuO and later Fe2O3. The orientation relationship between these clusters and the matrix differs from that observed in conventional steels. These findings provide a direct observation of oxide formation in single-phase Cu-Fe composites and offer a pathway for the design of nanocrystalline materials strengthened by oxide dispersions.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2041-1723			WOS:000426543800013	29507370

Changes in the effective surface area and in the catalyst morphology under reaction conditions have been examined by scanning electron microscopy and a krypton adsorption technique. It is shown that the regular kinetic oscillations arise under oxygen-lean conditions. CO, CO2, H-2, H2O, and propylene are detected as products. The conversion of propane oscillates in a range from 1% to 23%. During the half-periods with high activity, the main reaction pathway is the partial oxidation of propane: selectivity toward CO achieves 98%. In contrast, during the half-periods with low activity, the reaction proceeds through three competitive pathways: the partial oxidation of propane, the total oxidation of propane, and the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The driving force for the self-sustained kinetic oscillations is the periodic reoxidation of nickel. According to the Ni2p and O1s core-level spectra measured in situ, the high-active catalyst surface is represented by metallic nickel, whereas during the inactive half-periods the catalyst surface is covered with a thick layer of NiO. The intensity of O1s spectra follows the oscillations of O-2 in the gas phase during the oxidation of propane. It is found that during the induction period before the regular oscillations appear, a rough and porous structure develops because of strong reconstruction of the catalyst surface. The thickness of the reconstructed layer is approximately 10-20 mu m. This process is accompanied with at least an 80-fold increase in the effective surface area compared with a clean, non-treated nickel foil, which undoubtedly leads to a drastic increase in the number of active sites. We believe that it is the main reason for the induction period always being observed before the appearance of self-sustained oscillations in the catalytic oxidation of light hydrocarbons over catalysts with a low specific surface area (single crystals, foils, or wires). Moreover, without such reconstruction, the oscillations cannot arise due to low activity of such catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A three-dimensionally porous composite consisting of eggplant-CDs and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) was first synthesized via one-pot hydrothermal process. The as-synthesized RGO/CD hybrid was further deoxygenated with HI acid to enhance ionic conductivity and introduce iodine dopants in the structure. The I-doped graphene/CD composite exhibited specific capacitances of 432 and 460 F g(-1) at 2 mV s(-1) and 1 A g(-1) with excellent capacitance retention of 68.4% and 76.5%, as the scan rate and current density increased from 2 to 1000 mV s(-1) and from 1 to 100 A g(-1), respectively. Superior cycling stability of 94.6% capacitance retention over 10 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1) was measured. As an electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 M KOH, the composite demonstrated an onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE and a kinetic limiting current density of 19.8 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V vs. RHE with an average electron transfer number of 3.57. The I-doped graphene/CD composite showed excellent ORR stability with current density retention of 97.7% under electrochemical stress (0.65 V vs. RHE) in comparison with 43.4% of the benchmark Pt/C under similar conditions. Thus, a sustainable process was developed to synthesize a multifunctional electrode based on agricultural wastes for energy storage and ORR.									25	3	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000489727600049

The intrinsic activity, expressed in terms of turnover frequency (TOF), increases with decreasing iridium dispersion, indicating that NO reduction with CO over Ir/SiO2 is a structure-sensitive reaction. Characterization of Ir/SiO2 using TPO, XRD and FT-IR spectroscopy following CO adsorption shows that larger iridium crystallites are more difficult to be oxidized and much easier to be reduced under reaction conditions, resulting in the formation of stable iridium metal sites on which NO reduction occurs.

Besides, the capacity fade caused by the shuttle effect hinders the commercialization of Li-S batteries. To solve these problems, electrocatalysts have been proposed to promote the conversion of polysulfides and inhibit their diffusion. It has been demonstrated that the electrochemical performance can be greatly improved when electrocatalysts are introduced into Li-S batteries, but their mechanisms still require further clarification. For a more in-depth understanding of electrocatalysis in the sulfur electrode, this review summarizes the role of electrocatalysis from three aspects. First, the phase transition of sulfur species and the effect of electrocatalysts on the conversion of sulfur species are systematically summarized. Second, the research methods of electrocatalysts in Li-S batteries are introduced from computational chemistry and electrochemical detection methods. Third, according to the current development of electrocatalysts, strategies for improving electrocatalyst efficiency are summarized based on the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the active sites and the number of active sites. Finally, according to current electrocatalyst research, perspectives and future research efforts are proposed to facilitate the design and application of high-performance electrocatalysts for the sulfur electrodes of Li-S batteries.									39	2	0	0	1	0	40			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700001		
J	Sayler, Jeffrey D.; Brown, Sarah; Sibener, S. J.								Chain-Length-Dependent Reactivity of Alkanethiolate Self-Assembled Monolayers with Atomic Hydrogen								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	44			26932	26938		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b06809				NOV 7 2019	2019	Gas-surface interactions are some of the most important yet complex chemical processes to occur, as they intrinsically involve many-body phenomena across a wide spectrum of energies and length scales. To understand these complicated interfacial interactions, we often use model systems such as thiolate self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to study phenomena like reactivity and passivation, as these systems afford fine control over the surface parameters governing the events in question. In this study, we examine the effect of chain length on the reactivity of alkanethiolate SAMs with atomic hydrogen by monitoring morphological surface evolution throughout the reaction. These spatiotemporal data were obtained using ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV-STM) with directed in situ atomic hydrogen dosing. For a series of alkanethiolate SAMs 8- to 11-carbons long, we find that small increases in chain length cause disproportionately large decreases in reactivity. These reaction trends led us to develop a kinetic model characterized by two rate constants: a slow rate for hydrogen reactivity with close-packed domains, which is chain-length dependent, and a fast rate for reactivity with low-density regions, which is the same for all samples examined. In addition to reaction rates, we also tracked chain-length-dependent changes in surface morphology, notably how the size and shape of the SAMs' etch pits evolved following hydrogen exposure. Few differences were observed in the 10C and 11C samples, while there was a significant increase in the mean etch pit area of the 8C and 9C SAMs. Overall, this study provides important quantitative insights into how surface packing and dynamic disorder of organic thin films can influence their passivation capabilities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000495772100022

Here, we replaced the OER with an electrocatalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (EOD) of aldehydes for bipolar H-2 production and achieved industrial-level current densities at cell voltages much lower than during water electrolysis. Experimental and computational studies suggest a reasonable barrier for C-H dissociation on Cu surfaces, mainly through a diol intermediate, with a potential-dependent competition with the solution-phase Cannizzaro reaction. The kinetics of the EOD reaction was further enhanced using a porous CuAg catalyst prepared from a galvanic replacement method. Through Ag incorporation and its modification on the Cu surface, the geometric current density and electrocatalyst durability were significantly improved. Finally, we engineered a bipolar H-2 production system in membrane-electrode assembly-based flow cells to facilitate mass transport, achieving maximum current densities of 248 and 390 mA cm(-2) at cell voltages of 0.4 V and 0.6 V, respectively. The faradaic efficiency of H-2 from both the cathode and anode reactions attained similar to 100%. Taking advantage of the bipolar H-2 production without the issues associated with H-2/O-2 mixing, an inexpensive, easy-to-manufacture dialysis porous membrane was demonstrated to substitute the costly anion exchange membrane, achieving an energy-efficient and cost-effective process in a simple reactor for H-2 production. An estimated H-2 price of $2.51/kg from an initial technoeconomic assessment is competitive with US DoE's "Green H-2" targets.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000847523900001

Herein, a new type of RE hybrid electrocatalyst, consisting of a gadolinium-doped hierarchal NiFe-layered double hydroxide in situ grown on carbon cloth (Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC), is designed and developed via a facile one-step hydrothermal approach. The Gd doping regulates the electronic structure of NiFe-LDH and increases the number of oxygen vacancies, thus tuning the adsorption energies of oxygen intermediate species (e.g. HOO*). With the presence of Gd species, Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for the OER in an alkaline medium, which requires an overpotential of only 210 mV to afford 10 mA cm(-2) current density, better than that of NiFe-LDH@CC (250 mV) and commercial RuO2 (298 mV). The robust electrocatalytic stability and satisfactory selectivity (nearly 100% Faraday efficiency) of Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC for the OER are also demonstrated. We ascribe such outstanding OER performance of Gd-NiFe-LDH@CC to the optimized electronic structure, rich oxygen vacancies and hierarchal porous morphology. Theoretical calculation further demonstrates that the electronic disturbance caused by Gd doping enhances the activity of Ni sites, resulting in stronger binding strength of HOO* at the Ni sites during the OER.									60	1	0	0	4	0	60			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700043

The water plastoquinone photo-oxidoreductase enzyme, also known as photosystem II, uses light to perform the four-electron, four-proton oxidation of water to dioxygen and stores reducing equivalents in reduced forms of quinones which are ultimately used in dark reactions for the synthesis of energy-rich molecules. We report a nano-structured semiconducting conjugated polymer based on poly(diphenylbutadiyne) (nano-PDPB) and its photocatalytic activities towards the water oxidation reaction under visible light irradiation when dispersed in water in the absence of any sacrificial agents or co-catalysts. Charge recovery at the nano-PDPB directly or delayed in time was exemplified by the reduction of quinone acting as a hydrogen reservoir. In the absence of quinones as electron acceptors H(2)O(2)formation was detected, stemming from the partial reduction of O-2.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000550969100002	32953035

Nowadays, exploiting low-costing, high-performance and robust catalysts for AOR is essential to improve the overall efficiency of ammonia electrolysis cell (AEC). Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel free-standing three-dimensional (3D) porous N-doped graphene aerogel (NGA) anchored with Pt nanocluster (Pt/NGA) monolithic material as a high-performance and robust electrocatalyst for hydrogen production from AEC. The NGA substrate was facilely fabricated through a self -assemble process into the randomly arranged 3D porous backbone structure with graphene oxide (GO) and poly(oxypropylene)-diamine D400 as precursors in a pure water solvent. Then, the uniformly dispersed and embedded onto NGA through the simple electrodeposition method. The as-prepared Pt/NGA monolithic materials exhibited a higher ammonia electro-oxidation activity with the mass activity of 1.77 mA mu g(pt)(-1) and the specific activity of 0.64 mA cm(EcsA)(-2), due mainly to the uniformly dispersed Pt nanocluster-like morphology, the improved electrical conductivity, the 3D porous NGA networks as well as the N-doping structure in graphene framework. When the 3D Pt/NGA monolith was directly used as working electrodes of AEC, a considerable hydrogen volume of 8.5 mL (about 1.90 mL mg(pt)(-1)) was produced at 0.8 V in 3 h. This novel free-standing 3D porous NGA monolith is expected to be a potential and promising material for application in the fields of electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy transform.									35	1	0	0	5	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500041

However, in consideration of the scarcity and high cost, maximizing the efficiency of noble metals for catalysis is of prime importance in the societal pursuit of sustainable energy. In recent years, noble-metal single-atom catalysts (NMSACs) with well-defined structures have gained great research attention due to their maximum atom utilization efficiency (100%), distinct active sites and high catalytic activity and selectivity. This review comprehensively discusses the recent advancements in NMSACs for catalytic applications. Firstly, various fabrication strategies for NMSACs are introduced with a focus on how to effectively stabilize single noble-metal atoms on appropriate substrates and prevent their migration and aggregation. Subsequently, some advanced characterization techniques are presented to precisely probe the noble-metal active sites at the atomic level, which is critical to investigate the structure of NMSACs. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive summary of various types of NMSACs for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis, with special emphasis on the structure-activity relationships and the underlying catalytic mechanisms. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities are provided for guiding the rational design of advanced NMSACs toward various catalytic processes in the chemical transformation and energy conversion fields.									66	3	0	0	4	0	66			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000642166100001

Petrographic observations using optical and electron microscopes revealed that ilmenite grains in the Mirepoix, Sanford Lake, and Degrosbois Fe-Ti oxide deposits from Grenvillian anorthosite massifs contain hercynite in their rims but that hematite exsolution is absent in three of eight studied samples. Electron microprobe analyses showed that the ilmenite grains vary in TiO2 from 38.82 to 52.34 wt.%; in FeO from 33.15 to 45.88 wt.%; in Fe2O3 (calculated from stoichiometry) from 2.18 to 27.03 wt.%; in MgO from 0.05 to 2.49 wt.%; and in MnO from 0.26 to 1.51 wt.% and are thus comparable in composition to lunar ilmenite. Ilmenite, free of hematite, in two samples was homogeneous in composition (e. g., sample SL1: 50.4 -51.4 wt.% TiO2). Two sub-solidus reactions occurred amongst the oxide minerals in the studied deposits: (i) exsolution of hercynite in magnetite; and (ii) reaction between the hematite component in the ilmenite and the ulvospinel component of the magnetite, forming new ilmenite, which includes the hercynite. The reaction between the hematite component in the ilmenite and the ulvospinel component of the magnetite, when conditions are favorable for diffusion, produces ilmenite grains that are homogenous in composition and free of hematite exsolution. Ilmenite with little or no Fe3+ may occur in massive, fine-grained, and metamorphosed Fe-Ti oxide deposits and provide a terrestrial analogue source of ilmenite useful for the production of lunar mare simulant.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0008-4077	1480-3313		WOS:000315106800007

Descriptors bridge the gap between the physicochemical factors of electrocatalysts and their boosted activity and serve as guiding principles during the rational design of electrocatalysts. The optimal adsorption strength of key intermediates is potentially accessed under the tendentious guidelines proposed by indicators, such as d-band center, Delta G(H), E-O*, coordination number (CN), bond length, etc. Here, in this review, a comprehensive summary of the recent advances achieved regarding the descriptors during the rational design of electrocatalysts that aims for the recycling of C/H/N-containing chemicals is offered. The review is initiated by providing the necessity of the development of efficient electrocatalysts and then the physics behind the d-band center is introduced. Then a summary of the recent progress relating to the development of electrocatalysts under the guidance of descriptors is reviewed. Following that, an extended discussion regarding the experimental or theoretical characterization of the d-band center and the descriptors beyond it is provided. Finally, perspectives and challenges in this area are offered.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000707923900001

Compared with monometal sulfides, MMSs exhibit greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, which is largely originated from their higher electronic conductivity and richer redox reactions. In this review, recent progresses in the rational design and synthesis of diverse MMS-based micro/nanostructures with controlled morphologies, sizes, and compositions for LIBs, SIBs, HSCs, MABs, and water splitting are summarized. In particular, nanostructuring, synthesis of nanocomposites with carbonaceous materials and fabrication of 3D MMS-based electrodes are demonstrated to be three effective approaches for improving the electrochemical performance of MMS-based electrode materials. Furthermore, some potential challenges as well as prospects are discussed to further advance the development of MMS-based electrode materials for next-generation electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.									566	27	0	0	24	0	569			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000423342400008

However, this is rarely reported about water splitting applications of quaternary sulfides, phosphides and selenides. In this work, the Zn-Ni-Co-M (M = O, S, P and Se) nanoneedle arrays was in situ grown on nickel foam (Zn-Ni-Co-M/NF) for the first time by typical hydrothermal, sulfurization, phosphorization, and selenylation methods. In a typical three-electrode device, a small overpotential of 190 mV is obtained at 50 mA cm(-2) for water oxidation reaction utilizing the new Zn-Ni-Co-S/NF as anodic material. Moreover, a small overpotential of 94 mV was required at 10 mA cm(-2) for water reduction reaction when the new Zn-Ni-Co-P/NF sample is utilized as cathode material. The assembled electrolytic cell with Zn-Ni-Co-S/NF as the positive electrode and Zn-Ni-Co-P/NF as the negative material displays a superior electrocatalytic activity (1.52 V@10 mA cm(-2)) and a relatively surprising durability. The accessible and novel strategy for Zn-Ni-Co-M (M = O, S, P and Se) preparation provide a new view to develop new overall water splitting electrocatalyst with a superior activity and durability.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000613949500001

In this work, Zr-benzenedicarboxylate (UiO-66) and its derivative, Zr-2-NH2-benzenedicarboxylate (UiO-66(NH2)), are successfully prepared via a facile solvothermal method and applied to photocatalytic reactions. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirms the isoreticular nature of UiO-66 and UiO-66(NH2), while Fourier transformed infrared spectra (FTIR) prove the effective presence of amino group. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) show the photoabsorption edge of UiO-66 could be shifted to the visible light region by simply introducing the amino group (-NH2) on the organic ligand. Importantly, UiO-66(NH2) is proved to perform as an efficient multifunctional visible-light-driven photocatalyst with high stability and considerable recyclability in both the photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes using molecular oxygen as oxidant and catalytic reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) to Cr(III) under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the possible reaction mechanism has also been investigated in detail. This work makes a systematic attempt to understand the reaction of photocatalytic selective oxidation of alcohols over MOFs and represents the first example to report the identification of MOFs as promising visible-light photocatalysts toward reduction of aqueous Cr(VI). More significantly, our finding also provides a new way to design MOFs-based photocatalysts, that is, by tuning the predesigned ligands with specific functional groups, the optical absorption properties of MOFs can be flexibly modulated, and then the effective solar energy conversion can be expected.									315	15	0	0	46	0	323			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000323759600048	23903996

This evolution was driven by the idea that the best understanding is built at the molecular level. Now, it is clear that the molecular questions cannot be answered uniquely with dissolution experiments. At the surface it is unclear which functional groups are present, how they are arranged, and how they interact with each other and with solutes as the key bonds are activated. An alternative approach has developed whereby reactions are studied with nanometre-sized aqueous oxide ions that serve as models for the more complicated oxide interface. For these ions, establishing the structure is not a research problem in itself, and bond ruptures and dissociations can be followed with much confidence. We review the field from bulk-dissolution kinetics to the new isotope-exchange experiments in large oxide ions.									83	0	0	0	16	0	83			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000272854800012	20019664

Many strategies have been developed in the past few years to address the serious drawback of sluggish separation and migration kinetics of charge carriers. One of the most useful strategies in recent years has been the introduction of a local interaction field into the system due to its significant capacity toward separating photogenerated electron-hole pairs and some other advantages (i.e., promoting mass transfer, affecting reaction pathways, etc.). This review attempts to summarize the recent progress made in the rational design and construction of the local field in the photocatalysis community, mainly including the electric field, thermal field, magnetic field, ultrasonic field, and multifield coupling. The photocatalytic properties and charge transfer pathways of these systems are presented based on environmental and energy applications, for instance, water splitting, degradation of pollutants, small-molecule activation, and other semiconductor-induced chemical transformations. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges and prospects in utilizing the local field to improve the solar-energy conversion efficiency.									28	1	0	0	3	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700001

However, low surface area and poor charge separation greatly hinder its photocatalytic efficiency. A Ni+x(x=2, 3)/O-g-C3N4 photocatalyst with a very high specific surface area (199 m(2) g(-1)) has been prepared by thermal condensation and wet-impregnation methods. The oxygen-functionalized and Ni+x(x=2, 3)-coordinated g-C3N4 produced 1664 mu mol g(-1) of hydrogen evolution from water under direct solar light irradiation in 4 h, which is 23 times higher than that over O-g-C3N4. This significant enhancement results from the combined effects of large surface area, the formation of long-life deep-trap states, effective charge carrier separation, and extended visible light absorption. The separation and transport behavior of the charge carriers are investigated by photoluminescence, time-resolved photoluminescence, photocurrent and Mott-Schottky measurements. Additionally, the interaction between Ni+x(x=2, 3) and O-g-C3N4 is studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and FTIR spectroscopy. The Ni+x(x=2, 3)/O-g-C3N4 photocatalyst shows remarkable reusability over a period of two months (six cycles). This study may provide a pathway to simultaneously overcome the challenges of low surface area and poor charge separation in g-C3N4-based photocatalysts.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000482089800001	31276612

Herein, we synthesized an alanine-decorated MOF-5 via a solvothermal method using a mixture of dimethylformamide and water as the solvent. Experimental and computational investigations revealed that alanine residues were located in the micropores of MOF-5 due to interactions between the MOF Zn clusters and the carboxylic acid groups of the alanine moieties. In addition, the alanine-decorated MOF-5 was carbonized at 1100 & DEG;C for application as an electrocatalyst. It was found that the resulting N-doped carbonized sample exhibited excellent catalytic activities in the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions and afforded superior results to those reported for other metal-free carbon catalysts. This high activity originated from the single nitrogen configuration (pyrrolic N) in the hierarchical pores. This article presents a facile strategy for the syntheses of both functionalized MOFs and N-doped carbon materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000860782100001

The second-order upwind advection upstream splitting method and second-order Runge-Kutta method are used to discretize space and time terms, and detailed 9-species 19-step hydrogen-oxygen reactions are applied in this study. Nonpremixed rotating detonation is successfully realized numerically, and the characteristics of the detonation wave are revealed. The expanding angle of the combustor has a great impact on the shape of the detonation wave but has little influence on the propagation velocity. The evolution of combustion on the contact region is analyzed in detail; a more accurate schematic of non-premixed air-breathing rotating detonation engines is given in this paper. A rough analysis of the heat performance of the contact region shows that the heat release of the contact region is approximately one-third of the total heat release and the configurations of the combustors do not affect the proportion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-5966	1687-5974		WOS:000780654500003

In this study, three-dimensional (3-D) graphene-like carbon nanosheets (AGC) were prepared by one-step synthesis method as active carrier materials, and then MnCo-LDHs nanoflowers assembled with ultrafine nanosheets were loaded on them to construct a newly 3-D architecture of AGC/MnCo-LDHs nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS. The composite materials were assembled into OER and ORR electrodes for electrochemical measurements as efficient bifunctional catalysts. The favorable 3-D porous architecture (fast ion diffusion) of MnCo-LDHs and carrier effect of AGC (high electron conductivity) were the key contributing factors for their excellent electrochemical performances of nanocomposites.

The effect of acid slag treatment on the transition mechanisms of D-type inclusions and the precipitation of TiN inclusions in GCr15 bearing steel were explored. The obtained results showed that the dominant inclusions in steel were plastic and smaller Al2O3-SiO2-MnO. The melting point were lower than 1400 degrees C treated by the acid refining slag of 35.1%CaO-15%Al2O3-43.9%SiO2-6%MgO and there was no TiN found. The evolution of MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions is: MgO center dot Al2O3 -> MgO center dot Al2O3 center dot SiO2-MnO -> Al2O3 center dot SiO2 center dot MnO. Mg and Al from MgO center dot Al2O3 inclusions were displaced by [Si] and [Mn] in steel liquid , and formation of plastic Al2O3-SiO2-MnO inclusions finally, whose compositions distribution were uniform.

By using the working electrode that formed an oxide film by electrochemical pretreatment. the effect of the lattice oxygen of the surface oxide on the reaction was also examined. The measurement results were analyzed by the classical method, and then the analytical results were evaluated by digital simulation. The normal pulse voltammogram of the hypochlorite ion showed quasi-reversible oxidation waves. The apparent rate constant was calculated to be 5.0-8.1 x 10(-4) cm s(-1), depending on the electrode surface state. At the low-concentration range of < 4.0 mg Cl dm(-3), the oxidation current was concentration dependent at the cathodically polarized electrode, while it became independent after the anodic polarization.

Photooxidation of copolymers of fluorinated olefins and allyl or vinyl ethers								POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY				50	2			141	158		10.1016/0141-3910(95)00130-1				1995	1995	The photooxidation mechanisms of two copolymers of fluorinated olefins and allyl or vinyl ethers are studied. The ether groups that constitute the reactive part of both of the polymers are located on short pendant-chains. For this reason, the scissions due to the oxidation of the material lead to notable quantities of low molecular weight photoproducts that can be lost from the solid matrix by migration. The classical analysis of the evolution of the solid polymer matrix then has to be completed by an analysis of the gas phase formed during irradiation. Unanticipated results are obtained, since it is shown from the identification of the whole oxidation photoproducts that the presence of the fluorine strongly influences both the orientation of the reaction and the photooxidation kinetics. Due to the neighboring fluorine atoms, the methylene groups in a-position of the oxygen of the ether groups are not equivalent regarding oxidation and the secondary carbon becomes more oxidizable than the tertiary one. Moreover, these polymers show a very high resistance towards photooxidation, which is quite unusual with regard to polyethers in general.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			0141-3910			WOS:A1995TL60100002

Herein, we reported the photocatalytic production of HClO by oxidation of chloride (Cl-) in a dilute saline solution close to that of seawater over various dual cocatalyst-loaded WO3 powder photocatalysts using visible light as the energy source. The activities were improved more than twice by co-loading of Mn compared to the standard Pt/WO3. A maximum HClO formation rate of 37 mu mol h(-1) (about 2.6 ppm) was achieved when using Pt-Mn dual catalyst loaded WO3, which is effective for inactivation of various bacteria and fungi in drinking water. The photochemical and electrochemical studies revealed that the synergistic effect between Pt and Mn could not only promote the decomposition of H2O2 derived from the oxygen reduction reaction, but also increase the selectivity for oxidation of Cl- into HClO. This Pt-Mn dual cocatalyst modification strategy opens up prospects for efficient and economical production of HClO based on visible light energy.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000772911900001

Nowadays, much effort is being devoted to rationalizing the redox activities and searching for optimal compositions by changing the cations in A and B sites. Here, we show that different from general strategy, modification of the p-blocking centers through F-anion doping can provide opportunities to make a significant improvement in catalytic performance. Using this approach, we introduce an effective perovskite catalyst, La0.5Ba0.25Sr0.25CoO2.9-3F0.1, for water splitting. Through ab initio modeling, we show that F-anions help uplift the O p band center and activate the redox capability of the lattice O for electrocatalysis, which suggests the potential mechanisms for designing new materials. Additionally, our findings move beyond the conventional charge transfer steps on transition-metal sites and emphasize the importance of the lattice O redox mediation for electrocatalysis.									63	6	0	0	3	0	63			2451-9294			WOS:000453057600019

However, side reactions between the soluble catalysts and lithium metal anode and more importantly, the deposition of the solid Li2O2 particle on which side (lithium anode or oxygen cathode) is inevitable for the solution phase discharge process in Li-O-2 batteries, leading to the obvious capacity decay. Here we design and create a partial soluble metal nitroxides frameworks (MNOFs) to promote the "marriage" between the soluble and solid catalysts to overcome the most stubborn of these challenges. Taking advantage of the partial soluble property in the electrolyte, the prepared MNOFs can be simultaneously applied as the soluble and solid catalysts. MNOFs dissolving balance between electrolyte and cathode could construct a bridge between the electrolyte and cathode, which can not only suppress the corrosion reactions on Li anode, but also target discharge products deposition on the cathode. A 1Ah Li-O-2 cell with a high areal specific capacity of 40 mA h cm(-2) was demonstrated under a relatively low overpotential (similar to 0.6 V). By ideally bridging the soluble and solid catalyst, the reversibility is significantly improved.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2405-8297			WOS:000529908800032

Agardh. As a result, the dark green sea slug can be sustained in culture solely by photoautotrophic CO2 fixation for at least 9 months if provided with only light and a source of CO2. Here we demonstrate that the sea slug symbiont chloroplasts maintain photosynthetic oxygen evolution and electron transport activity through photosystems I and II for several months in the absence of any external algal food supply. This activity is correlated to the maintenance of functional levels of chloroplast-encoded photosystem proteins, due in part at least to de novo protein synthesis of chloroplast proteins in the sea slug. Levels of at least one putative algal nuclear encoded protein, a light-harvesting complex protein homolog, were also maintained throughout the 9-month culture period. The chloroplast genome of V. litorea was found to be 119.1 kb, similar to that of other chromophytic algae. Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction did not detect an algal nuclear genome in the slug, in agreement with earlier microscopic observations. Therefore, the maintenance of photosynthetic activity in the captured chloroplasts is regulated solely by the algal chloroplast and animal nuclear genomes.									89	3	1	0	79	0	92			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000089306200033	10982447

The Hill activity of the thylakoids proved to be at least as sensitive to inhibition by sorgoleone as it was to DCMU [3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea], a potent herbicidal inhibitor of PSII. However, a Photosystem I (PSI) partial reaction was not affected by a 10-fold greater concentration of sorgoleone than is required for complete inhibition of Hill activity. Measurements of flash-induced chlorophyll a variable fluorescence showed that sorgoleone neither dissipated excitation energy nor diminished the amplitude of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence. However, it inhibited the decay of variable fluorescence as effectively as DCMU, which blocks the oxidation of the PSII-reduced primary electron acceptor, Q(A)(-), by the PSII secondary electron acceptor, Q(B), by displacing Q(B) from the D-1 protein. Additionally, sorgoleone competitively inhibited the binding of [C-14]atrazine to the Q(B) locus. Increasing durations of trypsin proteolysis of the PSII membranes or thylakoids and of the Q(B)-binding niche itself caused parallel losses of inhibition of O-2 evolution from sorgoleone and DCMU, as well as from bromoxynil, a phenol-type herbicide also binding to the Q(B) locus.									95	2	0	0	75	4	106			0021-8561			WOS:A1997WU77300070

The heterostructures were ob-tained by decoration of hydrothermally derived CuCoO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on electrospun SnO2 nanofibers (NFs). Microstructural, morphological, optical, and electrochemical properties of SnO2 , CuCoO2, and the het-erostructures were characterized in detail. The photocatalytic activities of CuCoO2/SnO2 (0.25-1.25 wt% CuCoO2) were systematically examined and the highest activity was obtained for the SnO2 sample containing 0.35 wt% CuCoO2 and almost all the methylene blue (MB) dye (98.1 %) was degraded within 90 min. Compared to the SnO2 , 0.35 wt% CuCoO2-SnO2 exhibited 83 % increase in degradation rate of MB dye. This increase in photocatalytic activity was attributed to the narrow band gap CuCoO2 absorbing more light together with SnO2 , thus generating more electron (e -)-hole (h+) pairs and more successful charge separation thanks to the p-n junction they formed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000875103400003

Although some nanoalloys are known to remain stable in complex biological environment because of the electron compensation effect (ECE), the effective modulation of ECE has yet to be explored. Here, we have demonstrated that the ECE can be modulated after adsorption of carboxylate on gold silver nanoboxes (GSNBs), accompanied with the release of alloy nanoclusters, as supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and the electron density difference calculation. Moreover, the modulation efficiency is dependent on the pH of solution and the number of carboxylate groups. Using citrate as a representative, about 80 % silver components of GSNBs can be oxidized and released within 30 min in the presence of H2O2, producing highly-efficient antibacterial alloy clusters for both in vitro and in vivo applications. These results may offer a deep insight into modulation of intermetallic electron transfer of nanoalloys to develop new and effective antibacterial strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000865812500005

Herein, oxygen functionalized carbon nanotubes (oCNTs) supported a series of PtxCoy bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with varied Pt to Co ratios were synthesized. The introduction of Co significantly affects the electronic structure of Pt NPs, which clearly promotes the selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol (COL). Among all PtxCoy-oCNTs catalysts, PtCo3-oCNTs exhibited the best catalytic performance and a selectivity of over 76% towards COL at a CAL conversion of 99% was obtained. Further characterization of the fresh, used and cycled catalysts revealed that the NP structures were stable and did no change. The structural evolutions during the catalytic reaction were also investigated by identical location transmission electron microscopy (IL-TEM) method in detail, which found that the deactivation of PtCo3-oCNTs catalyst during the cycle experiment results from the agglomeration and detachment of PtCo3 NPs.

Recent, more applied studies have revealed that electrolyzers based on Cu electrocatalysts can reach current densities of up to hundreds of mA cm(-2). This opens up the opportunity for industrial application of Cu-based electrocatalysts. However, the stability of copper must first be assessed. In this communication we investigate the electrochemical corrosion behavior of copper in a broad pH window relevant to CO2 reduction applications. Using an electrochemical on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), we quantify Cu dissolution during anodic oxidation and during the reduction of electrochemically formed oxide species. We show that electrochemical oxidation of Cu leads to high dissolution in neutral and highly alkaline environments, while an intermediate pH of around 9-10 leads to minimal dissolution. The obtained results are discussed in relation to the CO2 reduction reaction to set a benchmark for stable Cu-based electrocatalysts.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000536516500005

Herein, we proposed a nonelectroactive surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) that could adsorb on the hydrophobic carbon surface and form a stable anionic layer upon charge, which can effectively suppress the diffusion of oxidized RM+ and facilitate charge transfer at the electrode-solution interface. To coordinate with SDS, a new RM named 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-l-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO) was adopted due to its oxidation process following after in situ formation of the anionic layer. Moreover, as a bifunctional mediator, PTIO cannot only get a low charge plateau but also greatly enhance the discharge capacity when applied in Li-O-2 batteries. The electrochemical results demonstrated that the cycling performance, energy efficiency, and discharge capacity were significantly improved owing to the synergistic effect of PTIO and SDS.									33	6	0	0	3	0	34			2380-8195			WOS:000417888400003

By use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared measurements, it was shown that the pendant groups of these polymers are removed by the argon plasma treatment. This resulted in the formation of unsaturated bonds and cross-links in the modified layer. It was found that the removal of the pendant groups is induced by UV light emitted by the argon plasma. During treatment of PAAc decarboxylation took place, which made the argon plasma more oxidative in character. The modified layer was reoxidized and eventually the PAAc surface was ablated with time. The removal of chlorine from PVC was found to be preferential, and a highly cross-linked layer, containing at least 15% unsaturated bonds, was obtained.

It has been shown that the processes of electrochemical oxidation of nitroanilines on investigated materials occur qualitatively the same and differ only in the rate. This suggests the invariability of the mechanism of their oxidation on different materials that allows one for a correct comparison of their electrocatalytic activity. The maximum interest for the electrochemical destruction of nitroanilines represents lead dioxide electrodes modified by fluorine to which a rate constant of p-nitroaniline oxidation increases in 3 times compared with nonmodified electrodes.

The ratios of the components in suspension providing the possibility of their anodic oxidation with the formation of compounds of the implementation of graphite were determined. The values of electrical conductivity of suspensions of graphite-nitric acid with different ratio of the solid and liquid phases were determined. The maximum value of the electrical conductivity of suspensions is achieved at the mass ratio of graphite to HNO3 approximate to 1: 0.66. The design of the electrochemical cell for carrying out chronovoltamperometric measurements on a suspension graphite electrode was developed. The nature and kinetics of electrode processes on dispersed graphite electrodes in 60% nitric acid were studied. It is shown that under anodic polarization of dispersion graphite electrode the complex of anodic processes occurs: the oxidation of surface of functional groups, the formation of compounds of implementation and evolution of oxygen. Maximum electrochemical reversibility of the anodic processes on the suspensions of graphite-HNO3 observed at E-rev<1.2 V, the rate of reactions of formation of compounds of the introduction of graphite and reactions involving surface functional groups on the electrode slurry increases in the range of potentials of 1.2-1.7 V. At that, the current is increase mainly causes by electrochemically reversible process of intercalation, since at the reverse cycle in the cathode area also recorded the growth of the current due to the reaction of deintercalation. An electrochemical oxidation of dispersed graphite electrode in HNO3 should be in the range of potentials from 1.2 V to 2.1 V, which will provide formation of compounds of introduction of graphite with the maximum rate and minimum power input.									1	0	1	0	0	0	2			0579-2991	2500-3070		WOS:000442822400002

Because of the very large scale required for the impact on fuel consumption, the scalability of artificial photosystems is of key importance. Closing the photosynthetic cycle of carbon dioxide reduction and water oxidation on the nanoscale addresses major barriers for scalability as well as high efficiency, such as resistance losses inherent to ion transport over macroscale distances, loss of charge and other efficiency degrading processes, or excessive need for the balance of system components, to mention a few. For the conversion of carbon dioxide to six-electron or even more highly reduced liquid fuel products, introduction of a proton conducting, gas impermeable separation membrane is critical. This article reviews recent progress in the development of light absorber-catalyst assemblies for the reduction and oxidation half reactions with focus on well defined polynuclear structures, and on novel approaches for optimizing electron transfer among the molecular or nanoparticulate components. Studies by time-resolved optical and infrared spectroscopy for the understanding of charge transfer processes between the chromophore and the catalyst, and of the mechanism of water oxidation at metal oxide nanocatalysts through direct observation of surface reaction intermediates are discussed. All-inorganic polynuclear units for reducing carbon dioxide by water at the nanoscale are introduced, and progress towards core-shell nanotube assemblies for completing the photosynthetic cycle under membrane separation is described.									95	4	0	0	5	0	95			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000378260000010	27121982

This is because single-cell is a complex process system affected by various factors, not just a catalyst evaluation system. To reduce the number of laborious tests, we used a machine learning algorithm to prioritize an alkaline fuel cell's operational factor from types of catalyst to fuel concentration for developing an overall performance prediction model. We selected seventeen input features from more than 80 I-V curves and 8000 data points and established prediction models based on two error-scoring modes (mean absolute error and root mean square error), which focused on operational conditions rather than catalytic characteristics. Both models from the two modes charted the factor importance and predicted the overall fuel cell performance with high R-2 values (> 0.95) before experiments.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000860974300001

There are many effective methods to suppress the dendritic growth of metallic lithium and promote the application of the lithium anode. However, the designation of lithiophilic sites at the atomic level remains a huge challenge. Herein, a two-dimensional porous conjugated porphyrin polymer linked by two acetylenic linkages from an in situ coupling reaction has been prepared on copper foil and employed as the lithiophilic host. The four electron-rich pyrrolic nitrogen atoms in the porphyrin building block and the linkage electron-rich sp-hybridized carbon atoms were regarded as precise lithiophilic sites, resulting in a decreased nucleation overpotential and dendrite free morphology. With uniform lithium deposition, the electrochemical performance of the electrode was significantly improved in regard to the overpotential, coulombic efficiency and lifespan. This work expands the precise construction of lithiophilic sites at the atomic level and benefits to further development of high-energy density lithium metal batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000711944800001	34708848

Molecular dynamics simulation is adopted to investigate the evolution process of passive film and oxidation process of reinforcement. The mean square displacement and self-diffusion coefficient of O-2 under different conditions are also obtained based on molecular dynamics simulation. It is shown that the present of chlorides can increase the energy of Fe atoms on the surface of Fe3O4 substrate, leading Fe atoms to separate from Fe3O4 easily and to get more chance to react with oxygen atoms. The interaction of chloride attack and mechanical loading can aggravate the damage of passive film on the surface of reinforcement and result in an increase of oxidation depth of Fe matrix. The coupled effects of chloride and static loading can accelerate the diffusion of O-2 to the iron matrix, thus increasing the oxidation reaction between the iron matrix and O-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1392-1320	2029-7289		WOS:000520841700004

Cobalt-containing spinel oxides are promising sensing materials for the gas-sensing reaction owing to their element abundance and remarkable activity. Structural and component properties can be modulated to optimize the sensing performances by substituting Co with other transition metals. Herein, a systematic study of spinel MCo2O4 oxides (M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) toward gas sensing is presented. Results show that ZnCo2O4 materials with a multishelled hollow twin-sphere structure obtained excellent sensing performances to formaldehyde and acetone at different temperatures. The replacement of Co with Zn in the lattice improves the oxygen-chemisorbing ability, which allows new opportunities to synthesize and design highly sensitive chemical sensors.									55	3	0	0	4	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000480498600059	31291077

Herein, synergetic effects developed between two nonprecious metal oxides, Co3O4 and NiO, are reported, with the resulting composite showing promising properties as a catalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. The activity of the composite material towards both the HER and the OER was enhanced and the dynamic potential decreased, as compared with its counterparts. Importantly, low Tafel slopes of 101 and 61 mVdec(-1) are found for the composite catalyst for OER and HER respectively. EIS measurements revealed a decreased impedance response of the composite dominated by the intermediate frequency relaxation, related to the adsorption of intermediates. Moreover, based on the structural features the improved catalytic activity of the composite is also due to high electroactive surface area, swift electron transfer kinetics, and excellent electrical chemical coupling between Co3O4 and NiO.

Although numerous nonprecious metal or metal-free carbon-based catalysts have been demonstrated to entirely or partially replace noble-metal-based electrocatalysis, the absence of precise design and a predictable process hindered the development. Well-defined 2D covalent organic polymers (COPs) as a new exciting type of electrocatalyst presented superior potentials with precisely controllable capacities, such as robust tailoring heteroatom incorporation and location of active sites. Here we demonstrate the possibilities and potential of the well-defined 2D COPs used as highly efficient energy electrocatalysts for clean and renewable energy technologies. After surveying recent developments, we further discuss the possible future directions for designed synthesis of intrinsic COPs without carbonization to modulate active sites and the density of active sites at the molecular level. COP materials as a new family of electrocatalysts offer practical possibilities to study the structure, mechanism, and kinetics of energy electrocatalysis and may lead to a better solution for energy and environmental issues.									83	13	0	0	6	0	87			2380-8195			WOS:000403303500008

The role of the cationic surfactant is critical for obtaining the anisotropic nanostructures of Co3O4 comprising an assembly of Co3O4 nanoparticles (diameter 5-50 nm). The shape (from spherical to highly elongated) and size of individual nanoparticles could be varied by the temperature of decomposition. Higher temperature led to elongated and larger particles. All of the nanorods showed antiferromagnetic behavior with a decrease in Neel temperature (T-N) with decrease in the average size of the individual oxide nanoparticles. The variation of TN with the particle diameter follows the finite-size scaling relation. These nanostructures were found to be excellent electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with a high current density of 104 mA/cm(2).									35	2	0	0	0	0	35			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000306942300049

The oxidic ceramics are found to be more stable in alkaline than in acid media. The surface stability decreases with the time of contact to the electrolyte and depends strongly on the polarization conditions. Segregation and decomposition effects are observed. Ageing effects are related to an increase of the ohmic resistance of the surface layers. A relatively positive reduction peak in cyclic voltammograms is correlated to the reduction of a formal Cu(III)-oxide species, which may be better explained in terms of a Cu(II)-peroxide species as [Cu2+-O-]+. The high-Tc-superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 does not act as a special electrocatalyst for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. The superconductivity of the samples is a bulk property and remains even after electrochemical surface treatment.									25	1	1		0	0	26			0217-9849			INSPEC:3193282

However, the (electro) chemical factors that favor Fe(0) oxidation rather than O-2 evolution during Fe(0) EC have not been identified. In this study, we combined electrochemical methods, electron microscopy and Fe measurements to systematically examine the interdependent effects of current density (i), anodic interface potential (EA) and solution chemistry on the Faradaic efficiency. We found that Fe(0) oxidation was favored (Faradaic efficiency > 0.85) in chloride and bromide solutions at all i, whereas carbonate, phosphate, citrate, and nitrate solutions lead to Faradaic efficiencies < 0.1. The anodic reaction (i.e. Fe(0) oxidation or O-2 evolution) only depended on i in the sulfate and formate solutions. Experiments in binary-anion solutions revealed that molar ratios of [HCO3 (-)]/[Cl-] near 100 and [NO3 (-)]/[Cl-] near 20 separated the electrochemical domains of Fe(0) oxidation and O-2 evolution in the EC system. These molar ratios were supported by experiments in synthetic groundwater solutions. We also found that the EA vs i curves for solutions with poor Faradaic efficiency overlapped but were situated 2-4 V vs Ag/AgCl higher than those of solutions with high Faradaic efficiency. Therefore, the position of the EA vs i curve, rather than the EA alone, can be used to determine unambiguously the reaction occurring on the Fe(0) anode during EC treatment.									25	1	0	0	13	0	25				2213-3437		WOS:000414041300085

Herein, we demonstrate a facile strategy for the in situ transformation of FeCo layered double hydroxide (FeCo-LDH) nanosheets into 1D spindle-shaped FeCo-MOFs for efficient OER. An optimized electrode of FeCo-MOF on a nickel foam (NF) was achieved by adjusting the addition of organic ligands and the reaction time in the hydrothermal reaction. Based on the unique 1D nanostructure and the cation regulation, the obtained FeCo-MOF exhibits a good catalytic performance toward the OER with a low overpotential of 475 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 121.8 mV dec(-1), and high long-term durability.

Heme peroxidases comprise the classical ligninolytic peroxidases and the new dye-decolorizing peroxidases, while heme peroxygenases belong to a still largely unexplored superfamily of heme-thiolate proteins. Nevertheless, basidiomycete unspecific peroxygenases have the highest biotechnological interest due to their ability to catalyze a variety of regio - and stereo-selective monooxygenation reactions with H2O2 as the source of oxygen and final electron acceptor. Flavo-oxidases are involved in both lignin and cellulose decay generating H2O2 that activates peroxidases and generates hydroxyl radical. The group of copper oxidoreductases also includes other H2O2 generating enzymes - copper-radical oxidases - together with classical laccases that are the oxidoreductases with the largest number of reported applications to date. However, the recently described lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases have attracted the highest attention among copper oxidoreductases, since they are capable of oxidatively breaking down crystalline cellulose, the disintegration of which is still a major bottleneck in lignocellulose biorefineries, along with lignin degradation. Interestingly, some flavin-containing dehydrogenases also play a key role in cellulose breakdown by directly/indirectly "fueling" electrons for polysaccharide monooxygenase activation. Many of the above oxidoreductases have been engineered, combining rational and computational design with directed evolution, to attain the selectivity, catalytic efficiency and stability properties required for their industrial utilization. Indeed, using ad hoc software and current computational capabilities, it is now possible to predict substrate access to the active site in biophysical simulations, and electron transfer efficiency in biochemical simulations, reducing in orders of magnitude the time of experimental work in oxidoreductase screening and engineering. What has been set out above is illustrated by a series of remarkable oxyfunctionalization and oxidation reactions developed in the frame of an intersectorial and multidisciplinary European RTD project. The optimized reactions include enzymatic synthesis of 1-naphthol, 25-hydroxyvitamin D-3, drug metabolites, furandicarboxylic acid, indigo and other dyes, and conductive polyaniline, terminal oxygenation of alkanes, biomass delignification and lignin oxidation, among others. These successful case stories demonstrate the unexploited potential of oxidoreductases in medium and large-scale biotransformations.									143	4	2	0	81	0	149			0734-9750	1873-1899		WOS:000410011800013	28624475

Herein, we demonstrate high-purity pyrrole-type FeN4 sites for the first time, as a superior ORR electrocatalyst for PEMFCs. The high-purity pyrrole-type FeN4 catalyst exhibited extremely outstanding ORR activity with an ultra-high active area current density of 6.89 mA m(-2) in acid medium, which exceeds that of most reported metal-nitrogen coordination catalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that high-purity pyrrole-type coordination significantly modifies the atomic and electronic structures of FeN4 sites, bringing with it high intrinsic catalytic activity, preferable O-2 adsorption energy and full four-electron reaction selectivity for ORR catalysis. Therefore, PEMFCs built with this high-purity FeN4 catalyst achieve a high open-circuit voltage (1.01 V) and a large peak power density (over 700 mW cm(-2)). High-purity iron-nitrogen coordination would give new insights into highly efficient electrocatalysts for PEMFCs.									169	10	0	0	11	0	171			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000508857600005

A composite catalyst based on nickel- 5,10,15,20-tetra(p-thioanisole) porphyrin complex (Ni-TPT-P) and carbon fibres (CF) is here investigated for the ORR. The porphyrin is synthesised by a one-pot multi-step approach. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) techniques are used to confirm the synthesis of the Ni-TPT-P complex. The metalloporphyrins (Ni-TPT-P) are non-covalently adsorbed on the CF via pi - pi stacking interaction. The composite catalyst shows well-defined redox peaks attributed to the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple in O-2-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution. The area under the reduction peak is used to calculate a surface coverage (Gamma) of 2.43 x 10(15) for the Ni2+/Ni3+ species on the catalyst surface area. The rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) technique is used to assess the performance of the catalyst towards the ORR. Key performance indicators such as the onset potential, average number of electrons and HO2- yield are found to be, 0.82 V vs RHE, 3.6 electrons and 22.0% respectively. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Journal of the American Chemical Society											10.1021/jacs.2c08902				2022-Nov-02	2022	The local coordination structure of metal sites essentially determines the performance of supported metal catalysts. Using a surface defect enrichment strategy, we successfully fabricated Pt atomic single-layer (PtASL) structures with 100% metal dispersion and precisely controlled local coordination environment (embedded vs adsorbed) derived from Pt single-atoms (Pt1) on ceria-alumina supports. The local coordination environment of Pt1 not only governs its catalytic activity but also determines the Pt1 structure evolution upon reduction activation. For CO oxidation, the highest turnover frequency can be achieved on the embedded PtASL in the CeO2 lattice, which is 3.5 times of that on the adsorbed PtASL on the CeO2 surface and 10-70 times of that on Pt1. The favorable CO adsorption on embedded PtASL and improved activation/reactivity of lattice oxygen within CeO2 effectively facilitate the CO oxidation. This work provides new insights for the precise control of the local coordination structure of active metal sites for achieving 100% atomic utilization efficiency and optimal intrinsic catalytic activity for targeted reactions simultaneously.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1520-5126		MEDLINE:36322840	36322840

Energetically optimal homotops obtained with the local optimizations were taken as the initial configurations in this simulation. The local optimization results of the Ir-rich nanoalloys demonstrate that Ag and Au atoms occupy the vertex position on the surface. Caloric curve, heat capacity, and Lindemann index methods were used for examining the thermal stability of the Ag-Au surface structure. It was obtained that the melting temperature of Ir-rich nanoalloys depends on the composition. For melting transitions of Ir-rich nanoalloys, two types were identified: structural deformations around the melting temperature and sudden jump. It was discovered that the melting mechanism of some specific nanoalloys generally has surface and inner shell melting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0892-7022	1029-0435		WOS:000793868100001

These results demonstrate that the mixed culture bacteria is more efficient in bioelectricity generation in microbial fuel cells and the anodic capacitance due to biofilm growth on anode plays an important role in the power generation of microbial fuel cells. The electrode resistance dominates over solution resistance due to Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Reactions. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In voltammetric measurements strong pH effects on capacitance and Faradaic current responses are observed due to chitosan forming a shell (or "hydrothermal wrapping") around both carbon nanoparticles and palladium particles in the water-based hydrothermal process. In spite of the wrapping, some Pd-catalytic processes are observed, but with pH controlling the rate. The shell around Pd nanoparticles appears to only allow small molecule reactants such as H-2 and O-2 but not formic acid or methanol to reach the active catalyst surface. Membrane-transport limited and reaction-type limited catalytic electrochemical responses are observed with high selectivity. Implications of small molecule selectivity and mechanistic selectivity in suppressing cross-over losses in fuel cell technology are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The derived electrocatalysts demonstrated altered selectivity and CO production rates for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 compared to the unmodified Ag foam. The activity change caused by the IL was dependent on the length of the N-alkyl substituent. The rate of CO production is optimized at moderate chain length and IL loadings. The observed trends are attributed to a local enrichment of CO2-based species in the proximity of the catalyst and a modification of the environment of its active sites.

However, this method is still impractical due to the lack of suitable photoanode materials that are efficient, stable, and cost-effective. Here, we present a surprisingly simple fabrication method for efficient, stable, and cost-effective nanometer-thick hematite films utilizing a rapid, ambient annealing approach. In the oxygen evolution reaction, the fabricated hematite films exhibit a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% already at 1 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), a real photocurrent density of 2.35 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus RHE, and a superior photo-oxidation stability recorded for over 1000 h. Considering the active surface area, the measured photocurrent density is higher than any value achieved so far by hematite and other single-material thin-film photoanodes. Hence, we show for the first time that undoped hematite thin films can compete with doped hematite and other semiconductor materials.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000757878500001

The oil-immersed scanning micropipette contact method significantly increases the droplet stability, allowing for prolonged mapping and the use of highly evaporative saline solutions regardless of ambient humidity levels. This systematic mapping technique was used to conduct a detailed investigation of localized corrosion taking place at the surface of an AA7075-T73 aluminum alloy in a 3.5 wt % NaCl electrolyte solution, which is typically challenging in the conventional scanning micropipette contact method. Maps of corrosion potentials and corrosion currents extracted from potentiodynamic polarization curves showed good correlations with the chemical composition of surface features and known galvanic interactions at the microscale level. This demonstrates the viability of the oil-immersed scanning micropipette contact method and opens up the avenue to mechanistic corrosion investigations at the microscale level using aqueous solutions that are prone to evaporation under noncontrolled humidity levels.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000572832900043	32786459

Most semiconductor-based photocatalysts show low oxidation activity, mainly because of poor charge separation and transfer. Here, we construct an artificial photosynthetic system for photocatalytic water oxidation using BiVO4 as a photosensitizer and cubic Co complex as the oxygen-evolving catalyst. This system exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF = 2.0 s(-1)) for O-2 evolution in the presence of NalO(3) as an electron acceptor, with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) yield of 4.5% at 420 nm, which is ninefold that of bare BiVO4 (0.5%), but the decomposition of the Co complex leads to decreased photocatalytic activity as time goes on. Spectroscopic studies confirmed an efficient interfacial hole transfer process from the semiconductor to the molecular catalyst.

TiO2 is considered as electrochemically inactive may be due to the poor surface reactivity. Manipulating the electronic structure and stability of TiO2 to work under realistic conditions is crucial for the optimal production of hydrogen and oxygen. Herein, new class of titanium compound, LiTiPO4F, has been identified as a water splitting electrocatalyst. The resulted new mesoporous LiTiPO4F has been used as an efficient bifunctional electro-catalyst, to catalyse HER and OER, in alkaline medium, for the first time. The proposed LiTiPO4F catalyst demonstrated an ultrahigh electrocatalytic activity and stability towards HER and OER. The proposed mesoporous LiTiPO4F delivers eta OER, 100 mA cm(-2) = 310 mV with Tafel slope of 93 mV dec(-1) and eta HER, -100 mA cm-2 = -290 mV with small Tafel slope of 48 mV dec(-1), revealing good OER/HER activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2468-0230			WOS:000681261900004

The silica nanoparticle covered with cobalt is especially important because it has a chemically stable core. Co3O4-NF was synthesized by the calcination of Co(OH)(2)@SiO2 under atmospheric air for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. After calcination, Ag deposition was performed to produce Ag@Co3O4-NF and their surface area reduces from 125.68 to 108.12 m(2)/g. The crystallanity and morphological features were observed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Furthermore, Ag@Co3O4-NF catalysts exhibited superior electrochemical performance as a cathode material for Zinc-air batteries. The cyclic test for charging and discharging was performed for 500 h revealing Ag@Co3O4-NF a potential catalyst, having splendid stability for the OER and ORR.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1387-7003	1879-0259		WOS:000637705500005

However, the catalytic degradation of lignin is kinetically challenging and often requires noble metal catalysts to be used under harsh and toxic conditions. Here, we report the bias-free, solar reformation of lignin coupled with redox biotransformation in a tandem structure of a BiVO(4)photoanode and perovskite photovoltaic. The tandem structure compensates for the potential gap between lignin oxidation and biocatalytic reduction through artificialZ-schematic absorption. We found that the BiVO4-catalyzed photoelectrochemical oxidation of lignin facilitated the fragmentation of higher molecular weight lignin into smaller carboxylated aliphatic and aromatic acids. Lignin oxidation induced photocurrent generation at the photoanode, which enabled efficient electroenzymatic reactions at the cathode. This study successfully demonstrates the oxidative valorization of lignin as well as biocatalytic reductions (e.g., CO2-to-formate and alpha-ketoglutarate-to-l-glutamate) in an unbiased biocatalytic PEC platform, which provides a new strategic approach for photo-biocatalysis using naturally abundant renewable resources.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000555342200031

However, its genuine active sites under realistic operating conditions remains elusive. Here, by virtue of the cutting-edge operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we unfold the dynamic evolution of the local electronic and geometric structures for the CH electrode upon cycling. Our results reveal that the irreversible redox of Co cations at the early stage of cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycling induces a phase transition in the NiCo CH nanowires forming oxygen vacancies-enriched NiCo layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets with superior high-rate energy storage ability. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that the unsaturated 5-coordinated Co sites exhibit optimal redox reaction energy barrier and immensely promote the performance. These findings not only elucidate the electrochemical susceptibility of the Co-based carbonate hydroxide under operando conditions, but also highlight an electrochemical coordination-engineering strategy for the rational design of high-performance electrode.									58	7	0	0	6	0	59			2542-4351			WOS:000520874200015

Their range of operation is limited by the thermal stability and this limits the energy (steam-Rankine cycle) efficiency of these processes. In this study, the effect of atmosphere on the thermal stability of nitrates was investigated using simultaneous thermal analysis techniques (STA). The use of oxygen (O-2) as a blanket gas was found to delay the decomposition point of the ternary NaNO3-KNO3-LiNO3 (13.23-57.14-29.63 weight ratio) mixture by 55 degrees C. By which operating range will increase 65 degrees C more compared to the binary solar salt. Higher heating rates increased the decomposition point but had less effect on premelting and melting properties. Nitrogen monoxide, and O-2 evolution after melting indicates concurrent reversible reactions. Similar phenomena were observed for single and binary nitrates. The eutectic melting point of ternary nitrate obtained from the STA agreed well with FactSage eutectic composition prediction.

PEMFCs significantly lost and partially regained performance for all tested electrodes. A significant effect on the membrane proton conductivity was noted in PEMFC but not in conductivity cells. The impact was dependent on the applied potential. Acetonitrile adsorption inhibits the hydrogen oxidation/evolution and the Pt oxidation and PtOx reduction reactions. Several peaks located at 0.17/0.22, 0.40/0.58, 0.65/0.78 V, and 0.9 V vs the hydrogen reference electrode were attributed to the redox of acetonitrile intermediates and products. Clear mechanistic insights were highlighted but a more complete integration of all these results and others obtained with a rotating ring/disc electrode (RRDE) will lead to a more definitive version of the acetonitrile contamination mechanism.					14th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)14th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell Symposium (PEFC)	OCT 05-09, 2014OCT 05-09, 2014	Ind Electrochemistry and Electrochem Engn Div; Battery Div; Corros Div; Energy Technol Div; Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; N E CHEMCAT CorpInd Electrochemistry and Electrochem Engn Div; Battery Div; Corros Div; Energy Technol Div; Phys & Analyt Electrochemistry Div; Army Res Off; Off Naval Res; N E CHEMCAT Corp	Cancun, MEXICOCancun, MEXICO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-539-5	WOS:000356722200080

Therefore, a variety of hydrothermal reaction experiments were carried out, and it is very interesting to obtain a series of products of Nickel-cobalt compounds with different shapes, including hexagonal, nanowire arrays, irregular block and urchin-like structure etc. It was observed that the phase state of cobalt-nickel compounds could change from the conventional continuous solid phase to porous phase of micro/nanostructure via sulfuration. Especially, as an electrode, the obtained porous material, honeycomb-inspired nickel cobalt sulfides, delivered a specific capacity of 1020 F/g at a high current density of 30 A/g, and an aqueous symmetrical supercapacitor with the electrode delivered a maximum energy density of 68 Wh/kg, a high power density of 7999 W/kg at 28 Wh/kg, and lighted a red LED for more than 60 s, showing excellent electrochemical property.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000580607200001

We demonstrated that the enhancement of the photo-electrochemical performance of the hematite film treated by both methods was not just the summation of the improvements originating from each treatment but showed a significant cooperative effect. We clearly revealed that the strong electric field was effectively induced by the surface P doping with the concentration gradient profile, resulting in band bending even at 0 V vs. RHE. Furthermore, the dead layer was removed by the TiO2 underlayer, giving rise to Fermi level unpinning. We confirmed that the introduction of the TiO2 underlayer unpinning Fermi level enables building on the strength of the intrinsic long-lived holes generated by P doping, which is the origin of the cooperative effect.									8	1	0	0	3	0	8			2398-4902			WOS:000534220100051

A long-optical-path thin-layer cell was used for the spectroelectrochemical measurements. A stable quinonic product with a united conjugated structure was found to form at the first anodic peak or higher potentials via an EC mechanism, and was non-electroactive unless oxygen evolution potential was reached. Quercetin both in the free solution and pre-adsorbed on electrodes participated in the reaction at the first anodic peak, and the contribution of species in solution to total current was estimated. The subsequent anodic peaks as well as all the cathodic peaks were adsorption waves corresponding to the further redox of the adsorbed intermediates. The results demonstrate that cyclic voltabsorptometry in a long-optical-path cell is a feasible method for the analysis of electrochemical processes coupled with adsorption and homogeneous chemical transitions.									17	2	0	0	5	0	19			0910-6340	1348-2246		WOS:000264450600010	19276593

Potential oscillations during the electrochemical treatment of white liquor								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMISTRY				42	5			551	559		10.1134/S1023193506050144				MAY 2006	2006	Potential oscillations during the electrochemical treatment of white liquor are reported on. White liquor in the kraft process is composed mainly of sodium sulfide, sodium hydroxide, and sodium carbonate. Cyclic voltammetry, linear galvanic voltammetry, and galvanostatic techniques are used to characterize the behavior of the potential oscillations. The amplitude of the harmonic potential oscillations is between -150 and 750 mV (SCE). The behavior of the potential oscillations strongly depends on the applied current density, temperature. and mass transfer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is employed to study the origin of the oscillations during the electrochemical treatment of the white liquor on the Ti/Ta2O5-IrO2 electrodes. Negative faradaic impedance is observed in the potential range of the potential oscillation amplitudes, and equivalent circuits are designed to fit the experimental impedance spectra. The potential oscillations are caused by the synergic effect of sulfur formation/removal and oxygen evolution in the high-potential range.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000237772000014

We showed that all three subunits examined (OE33, OE23, and OE17) partition between the thylakoid lumen and a site on the inner surface of the thylakoid membrane after import in a homologous system (e.g., pea or spinach subunits into pea or spinach chloroplasts, respectively). Although some interspecies protein import experiments resulted in OEC subunit binding, maize OE17 did not bind thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts isolated from peas. Newly imported OE33 and OE23 were washed from the membranes at the same concentrations of urea and NaCl as the native, indigenous proteins; this observation suggests that the former subunits are bound productively within the OEC. Inhibition of neither chloroplast protein synthesis nor light- or ATP-dependent energization of the thylakoid membrane significantly affected these assembly reactions, and we present evidence suggesting that incoming subunits actively displace those already bound to the thylakoid membrane. Transport of OE33 took place primarily in the stromal-exposed membranes and proceeded through a protease-sensitive, mature intermediate. Initial binding of OE33 to the thylakoid membrane occurred primarily in the stromal-exposed membranes, from where it migrated with measurable kinetics to the granal region. In contrast, OE23 assembly occurred in the granal membrane regions. This information is incorporated into a model of the stepwise assembly of oxygen-evolving photosystem II.									51	0	1	0	50	0	53			1040-4651			WOS:A1997WQ64900015	12237359

This paper investigates physical properties, rheological properties, morphology and molecular structure of rejuvenated SBS modified bitumen (SMB) with 1, 4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BUDGE) or trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether (TMPGE). The results of physical properties indicate that BUDGE and TMPGE can both improve the low-temperature ductility and penetration of aged SMB, and by contrast, BUDGE can make the aged SMB more flexible at low temperature. From the rheological properties, BUDGE or TMPGE can help restore the crack resistance at low temperature and somewhat decrease the rutting resistance at high temperature, which relies on the reduction of fatigue factor and rutting factor of aged SMB. FTIR spectra and fluorescence images show that the original structure of SBS can be partly rebuilt through the chemical reaction between the terminal groups on BUDGE or TMPGE and the oxygen-containing reactive groups on degraded SBS.

The morphology of the precursors could be precisely controlled from cubic-like to spherical-like by introducing citrate. Because of the synergistic catalytic reaction of bimetallic Mn-Fe oxides, micromotors with different shapes could be powered efficiently in H2O2 solution. In particular, the obtained cubic Mn-Fe oxide micromotors showed strong propulsion at a speed of 71.21 mu m s(-1) in 1% H2O2 solution. With dual mechanisms of adsorption bubble separation (ABS) and Fenton oxidation, the cubic Mn-Fe oxide micromotors showed extraordinary removal ability for Rhodamine B (RhB) as a simulated pollutant and could remove up to 95.2% of RhB within 30 minutes. Magnetic Fe3O4 contained in the component not only could degrade organic pollutants, but also could be recycled by magnetic field and reused with high degradation efficiency. These dual-functional metal oxide catalytic micromotors provide a practical and environmentally friendly strategy for environmental restoration.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000782947200001

The Co3O4/rGO/BiVO4 photoanode shows a remarkable photocurrent density of 2.8 mA cm(-2) at 2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under AM 1.5G solar light irradiation, which is a four-fold increase compared to that of pristine BiVO4. The photocurrent generated by coating of the catalytic Co3O4 and rGO layers onto BiVO4 is similar to 93% of that generated in an electrolyte with a hole scavenger, which demonstrates the critical roles of the Co3O4 and rGO catalysts in the high PEC water splitting performance of the Co3O4/rGO/BiVO4 photoanode.

Their porosity and structural versatility offer a tantalising consolidation of the components needed for solar light harvesting and water splitting. Herein, we describe a selection of relevant contemporary investigations that employ electrocatalysis, chemically introduced redox partners, and photo-catalysts to generate dioxygen and dihydrogen from water. The role of semiconducting MOFs in these systems is addressed, in tandem with band gap control by linker functionalisation and doping. Considered holistically, MOFs offer an impressive physical, spatial and chemical versatility with which to support and sustain water splitting reactions. Major challenges toward practical implementation do remain, but opportunities for development are evidently numerous.									230	12	0	0	24	0	231			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000357541300005		
J	Chen Bo; Zhu Yongfeng							陈博; 朱永峰	Petrology of ultramafic rock in Darbut ophiolite (Xinjiang),evidence from Cr-spinel			新疆达拉布特超镁铁岩成因来自铬尖晶石的证据				地学前缘	Earth Science Frontiers				15	6			312	322	1005-2321(2008)15:6<312:XJDLBT>2.0.TX;2-W					2008	2008	This paper reports the investigation on the petrology of spinel harzburgite and olivine pyroxenite in the Darbut ophiolitic melange,as well as the worm-like intergrowth texture composed of Cr-spinel and orthopyroxene wide-spreading in harzburgite(Western Junggar,Xinjiang).Our study shows that the observed intergrowth texture is not a graphic texture or a symplectite as assumed by previous research,instead,it is a product of the evolution of the Cr-rich magma formed after the melting of the primitive mantle.After highly fractionating,this Cr-rich magma formed massive chromite(i.e.,Sa'ertuohai chromite deposit),and the melt moved into the mantle rock,and formed the worm-like intergrowth texture consisting of Cr-spinel and orthopyroxene.Therefore,the intergrowth texture of Cr-spinel and pyroxene can be an important indicator for podiform chromite exploration.We also report the exsolution texture of Cr-spinel in orthopyroxene in the studied harzburgite,and suggest that it is the result of a metamorphic reaction induced by the drastic increase of oxygen fugacity during the rapid emplacement of Darbut ophiolite.			通过研究西准噶尔达拉布特蛇绿混杂岩中方辉橄榄岩和橄榄辉石岩的岩石学特征,分析方辉橄榄岩广泛发育的铬尖晶石和斜方辉石构成的蠕虫状共生连晶结构的成因,得出结论认为:这种共生连晶结构不是前人所认为的文象结构或者石榴石的后成合晶,而是原始地幔岩熔融形成富铬岩浆的演化产物。这种富铬岩浆高度分异形成铬铁矿块体(即萨尔托海铬铁矿矿床)后,熔体进入地幔岩中结晶形成铬尖晶石和斜方辉石的蠕虫状共生连晶结构。因此,铬尖晶石与辉石的共生连晶结构可以作为豆荚状铬铁矿的重要找矿标志。方辉橄榄岩中的斜方辉石发育铬尖晶石出溶结构,出溶棒的成分特点表明,该结构是达拉布特蛇绿岩在快速就位过程中环境氧逸度突然升高诱发变质反应的结果。						11	8	0	0	0	0	14			1005-2321			CSCD:3441177

An intermediate was observed that exhibited significant quenching by oxygen. This intermediate was identified and attributed to the pipi* triplet state of HPA. Temporal evolution at early picosecond times indicates rapid intersystem crossing conversion and subsequent relaxation of the excess energy of the initially formed triplet state. B3LYP/6-311G** density functional theory (DFT) calculations were done to determine the structures and vibrational frequencies for both the HPA triplet and ground states. The experimental and theoretical results were compared and discussed in relation to the initial pathway for the p-hydroxyphenacyl deprotection reaction and the nature of the triplet state relative to other aromatic carbonyl compounds. The present results demonstrate the utility of applying ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy to study the mechanism of the photorelease process in phototrigger compounds.									25	0	0	0	9	0	25			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000222279100073

This has been isolated as a perchlorate salt. The X-ray structure of [Mn(II)2L]ClO4.H2O is reported. The lattice consists of two crystallographically independent but metrically very similar binuclear units. Manganese(II) ions are tris mu2-phenolato bridged and the distorted octahedral metal coordination spheres are of type MnN3O3. The frozen (77 K) EPR spectrum of the complex shows group of 11 hyperfine lines with coupling constants of 43.7 G showing that the unpaired electrons interact with both ''Mn centres. The complex displays two successive oxidation couples with E1/2 values 0.54 and 1.07 V vs saturated calomel electrode.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0277-5387			WOS:A1994MY82400019

We found that several modes in the difference IR spectrum are associated with bond rearrangements induced by the second laser flash. Most of these IR modes are absent in spectra of S-2/S-1, Of the acceptor-side non-heme ion, of Y-D(.)/Y-D and of S-3'/S-2' from Ca-depleted PSII preparations. Our results suggest that these IR modes most likely originate from structural changes in the oxygen-evolving complex itself upon the S-2-to-S-3 state transition in PSII.

This work is focused on the preparation of 3D graphitic carbon networks co-doped by N, F, P or B by self-assembling ionic liquids such as BMIM-PF6 and BMIM-BF4. The enhanced properties of the 3D PNF-rGO and BNF-rGO was proved by XRD, FTIR, RAMAN, and XPS spectroscopy. Most interestingly we observed that both the material displays 3D morphology (nanosphere and cubes) in FE-SEM and HR-TEM analysis. Furthermore, the synthesized material exhibited the excellent catalytic activity in OER with an overpotential of 110 and 170 mV at a current density of 236 and 176 mA/cm(2) with prolonged stability over 12 h. These results further confirmed by Tafel slope and EIS measurements. The smaller Tafel slope 73, 90 mV/dec and lower resistance 18 Omega, 37 Omega were obtained for PNF-rGO and BNF-rGO respectively. In addition, this catalyst showed exceptional catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-NP. The PNF-rGO and BNF-rGO reduce the 4-NP within 1.83 and 2.33 min. The observed rate constant and TOF values are better than those of the previously reported graphene-based nonmetallic catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

All materials were evaluated for their OER activity in 0.1 M KOH, of which the Fe-NiO/SNFs showed a notable improvement over NiO/SNFs and unsupported NiO. The results presented herein demonstrate the extension of our previously reported synthesis for NiO/SNFs to yield SNF-supported mixed transition metal-oxide materials. The versatility and scalability of the synthesis are particularly interesting for the facile preparation of three-dimensional, binderless electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis applications.

Hydroxyl group-modified polymeric carbon nitride/niobium pentoxide nanosheets heterojunction (OH-PCN/Nb2O5) is designed for fast electron transfer from Nb2O5 to OH-PCN. Electron rich O site, induced by electron transfer occurred in C-O-H-O-Nb bond, acts as an ideal adsorption site for phenol through O-H...O bond. Super active site, formed by integrating triazine ring site on OH-PCN (activation site for O-2) and O site on Nb2O5 (adsorption site for phenol), facilitates the evolution of O-2 and in-situ photomineralization of phenol. OH-PCN/Nb2O5 shows a more than 8-fold improvement in phenol photodegradation efficiency than PCN. Briefly, this work provides insights on constructing interfacial super active sites by interface control of catalysts and in turn dramatically improving the photocatalytic performance.

The influence of load and temperature on the interface behavior during dry friction between amorphous cotton fiber and chromium, the contact interface evolution and friction coefficient are studied using reactive molecular dynamics. The simulation results show that chromium-oxygen bonds are formed on the contact interface of the friction system during the sliding process. Furthermore, the relationship between friction coefficient, temperature, and load varies with the mechanical state of cotton cellulose. The relationship is positive when the cotton cellulose is in the glassy state. However, when cotton cellulose is in a highly elastic state, its friction coefficient is negatively related to the load. This study systematically evaluated the effects of temperature and load on the slip process from the atomic scale, provided a reason for the wear of the hard materials of the friction pair, and provided theoretical support for the study of this type of friction mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0576-9787			WOS:000798162400001

Developing efficient, low-cost and stable electrocatalysts is crucial for this electrochemical reaction. In this work, we have reported a facile process for the synthesis of hybrid nanosheet-structured NiCo2O4 on carbon fiber paper (NiCo2O4-CFP) for the efficient electrochemical conversion of HMF into FDCA. As a non-noble binary metal-based catalyst, NiCo2O4-CFP featured a nanosheet network and 3D nanosheet flower-like microspheres, showing 94.3% selectivity and 89.6% faradaic efficiency (FE) for FDCA, which outperformed its single component metal oxides NiO-CFP and Co3O4-CFP. And it also exhibited relatively high stability by maintaining over 80% FE after four successive cycles. The proposed mechanism suggested that the synergistic effect of Ni and Co elements in NiCo2O4 could facilitate HMF oxidation.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000659216400001

In this work, in-situ growth of highly disordered iron-nickel nitrate hy-droxide (FeNiNH) nanoplates on nickel foam via a simple one-pot solvothermal method is demonstrated. The highly disordered FeNiNH exhibits coexistence of amorphous and crystal microstructure, providing more active sites from boundaries, while Fe incorporation improves the electronic structure, indeed ac-celerating intrinsic activity. The optimized Fe1Ni9NH shows high electrocatalytic activity with a low over -potential of 209 mV at 50 mA/cm2, a Tafel slope of 73 mV/dec and good long-term stability. Deep phase transformation from FeNi nitrate hydroxide to FeNi oxyhydroxide can be discovered with nitrate leaching during OER process.

Present approaches utilize rationally designed hard-template precursors with desired morphologies and adopt transcription of the same to achieve morphologies of complex metal oxides. In the present work, we chose strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSMO) as a model system to demonstrate our transcription methodology. The improved electrochemical active sites of LSMO are achieved by tuning unique morphologies of manganese oxide (MnxOy). Diffusion-controlled solid-state route enables transcription of the pre-defined morphologies of MnxOy into the corresponding LSMO. Our best morphological LSMO achieved a similar to 4-fold increment in overall electrocatalytic OER performance compared to its solid-state synthesized counterpart. This approach offers a unique way to realize highly efficient OER catalysts of high temperature-synthesized complex metal oxides and can be extended to any general system.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000717730900001

The mechanochemical treatment of the commercial graphite powder was performed for 2h using a planetary ball mill apparatus with large stainless steel balls (10 mm diameter) that did not require the aid of solvents. As a result, multilayer graphenes were successfully obtained when the rotational speed of the planetary ball mill was 500 rpm or more. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the resulting multilayer graphenes contains many defects, while electrochemical measurements revealed that this multilayer graphene has high stability against anodic corrosion. Moreover, a higher bifunctional ORR/OER activity was observed for this material than other bifunctional ORR/OER materials, such as LaNiO3 and multilayer graphene synthesized by a modified Hummer's method. This excellent electrochemical performance implies that the mechanochemically synthesized multilayer graphenes with high stability and high bifunctional ORR/OER activity obtained in this study can be an excellent alternative to carbon black, which is conventionally used for air electrode materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000674969900001

We find that only in the cis form does Cu-II(pyalk)(2) convert water to dioxygen. In a series of alternating chemical and electrochemical steps, the catalyst is activated to form a metal oxyl radical species that undergoes a water-nucleophilic attack defining the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The experimental H/D KIE (3.4) is in agreement with the calculated value (3.7), shown to be determined by deprotonation of the substrate nucleophile upon O-O bond formation. The reported mechanistic findings are particularly valuable for rational design of complexes inspired by Cu-II(pyalk)(2).									26	0	0	0	2	0	26			2155-5435			WOS:000444364800022

Rhodium alloys are known to have enhanced hydrogen storage and improved thermal stability versus pure palladium. However, the distribution of rhodium on pore and particle surfaces is critical to this. Pores are more ordered and thermally stable in rhodium-rich regions. Treatment of particles at elevated temperature under reducing conditions can cause rearrangement of Rh and Pd at the surface, but not a major change in Rh distribution throughout the particle. Heating in the presence of hydrogen causes more rapid pore rearrangement than heating in vacuum subsequent to hydrogen exposure, suggesting a direct chemical influence of hydrogen on mobility of surface atoms. These results provide a clear path to future improvements in the stability of nanoporous metals in reducing atmospheres.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0897-4756			WOS:000301947000007

The influence of the current density was also investigated showing that the oxidation rate of p-benzoquinone increased only slightly with increasing current density. The efficiency of the p-benzoquinone oxidation was found to depend on several properties of the anode material, not just its chemical nature. Furthermore, efficiencies for the partial oxidation of p-benzoquinone using specially prepared noble-metal-oxide-based anodes were found to be only somewhat smaller or even as high as those observed for PbO2 or antimony-doped tin oxide anodes, respectively. The anodic electrolysis of maleic acid solutions was found to decrease the activity of IrO2 for the oxidation of organic compounds. This was not observed when PbO2 was employed for the oxidation of maleic acid. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society. S0013-4651(98)12-099-2.

Many of these reactions are synthetically challenging, and developing small molecular iron-based catalysts that can achieve similar reactivity and selectivity remains a long-standing goal in homogeneous catalysis. This review focuses on the development of bioinspired facial N,N,O ligands that model the 2-His-1-Carboxylate facial triad to a greater degree of structural accuracy than many of the polydentate N-donor ligands commonly used in this field. By developing robust, well-defined N,N,O facial ligands, an increased understanding could be gained of the factors governing enzymatic reactivity and selectivity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0009-4293			WOS:000546101700003	32560750

Here, we demonstrate high-crystallized nanowires of Nb-doped rutile TiO2 for significantly increasing electron carrier density through a convenient method. The optimized Nb-doped TiO2 nanowires (0.5mol% in the Nb/Ti ratio) yield a high value of charge separation efficiency (eta(sep)) of 97.39% at 1.23 V-RHE, which is about 3 times as much as that of pristine sample (33.61% at 1.23 V-RHE). Moreover, the photoanode of Nb-doped TiO2 nanowires can achieve high charge transfer efficiency (eta(trans)) (91.07% at 1.23 V-RHE) without any oxygen evolution reaction catalysts. These results indicate that through appropriate amount of Nb doping can move the performance of TiO2 nanowires to their theoretical potential.									14	1	0	0	2	0	14			2365-6549			WOS:000398581000027

The strategy is to increase charge-transfer kinetics and, hence, to reduce overpotential requirements. Relatively underwhelming attention has been paid to how such surface treatments influence the nature of the semiconductor/solution interface so as to reduce photovoltage generated by the photoelectrode. Using atomic layer deposition-grown (ALD) MnOx on hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) as an example, here, we show that increased charge-transfer kinetics does not necessarily lead to improved overall performance. Compared to bare hematite, MnOx-decorated photoelectrode exhibits significant anodic on-set potential shift. The phenomenon is understood as a substantial reduction in photovoltage generation by hematite, and the origin is identified as Fermi-level pinning effect due to MnOx introduction. This work sheds light on the importance of maintaining band-edge pinning for semiconductor-based photoelectrochemical reactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Time resolved single photon counting has been used to monitor the time dependent concentrations of the singlet states in intact and manganese depleted BBY-type core particles studied with Q(A) in a fully open state. Surprisingly, no difference is observed between the experimental results obtained from the intact and manganese depleted samples. We demonstrate that this could be indicative of a very deep primary radical pair trap formed in PSII core particles with Q(A) in a fully open state. Alternatively, static inhomogeneity or a possible time-dependence of the Q(A) redox potential via relaxations such as proton motions should be considered. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The role of the D-E region was studied in 27 site-directed mutants generated in the psbAII gene of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The photochemical performance of the modified PSII reaction centers was assessed with respect to photoautotrophic growth, oxygen evolution, fluorescence induction, and herbicide inhibition. A few mutations, located at positions presumably involved in essential interactions in the Q(B) binding niche, greatly interfered with PSII performance. On the other hand, mutations in the presumptive loop region between helices D and de resulted in relatively minor effects, indicating a flexible region not critical for photochemical function. Indeed, although more than 80% of the D-E region is phylogenetically invariant, the bulk of the mutations affected the measured parameters only moderately. The significance of the conserved residues appears to be in subtle interactions that optimize the thermodynamic balance between some of the redox components of PSII, as indicated by mild changes in the steady state fluorescence. Many mutations modified tolerances to PSII herbicides. The dispersion of these mutations throughout the D-E region indicates the complex nature of the interactions, direct and indirect, affecting herbicide binding in the Q(B) niche. Mutation of codons Ser221 and Ser222 to Leu221 and Ala222 revealed a new location coordinating the herbicide diuron in the D1 protein. Mutational analysis of the D-E region fully supports the widely held analogy in structure and activity between the D1 protein of PSII and the L subunit of the bacterial reaction center.									47	0	0	0	40	0	49			0006-2960			WOS:A1994PE32800035	8068689

OH molecules are generated in v=6-9 by the reaction of hydrogen atoms and ozone. The (10,7) vibrational transition is excited with pulsed near-infrared laser light to create a population of OH (v=10) molecules. The temporal evolution of the v=10 population is monitored as a function of collider gas pressure by a time-delayed ultraviolet laser pulse. The probe step uses laser-induced fluorescence by exciting the B (2)Sigma(+)-X (2)Pi (0,10) transition and detecting the fluorescence from the B (2)Sigma(+)-A (2)Sigma(+) (0,6-8) transitions. From 310 to 223 K, the OH (v=10) removal cross section increases by 35+/-21, 33+/-14, and 58+/-48 percent for the colliders O-2, N2O, and CO2, respectively. This inverse temperature dependence is typical of a loss mechanism governed by long-range attractive forces.

Herein we report novel studies offering proof of concept that spectrofluorometric electrochemistry can provide important mechanistic detail into these processes. A thin layer opto-electrochemical cell, with a carbon fibre (radius 3.5 mu m) working electrode, is used to visualise the optical responses of the oxidative destruction of a fluorophore either directly, on an electrode, orviathe indirect reaction of the analyte with an electrochemically formed species which 'mediates' the destruction. The optical responses of these two reaction mechanisms are first predicted by numerical simulation followed by experimental validation of each using two fluorescent probes, a redox inactive (in the electrochemical window) 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid and the redox-active derivative 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid. In the vicinity of a carbon electrode held at different oxidative potentials, the contrast between indirect electro-destruction, chlorination, and direct oxidation is very obvious. Excellent agreement is seen between the numerically predicted fluorescence intensity profiles and experiment.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000541863900005	32459226

In recent years, the exploration of high-performance electrocatalysts has achieved significant progress by resorting to defect engineering strategy, which encouraged the researchers to understand the relationship between defects in catalysts and electrocatalytic performance. In this review, recent advances in defect engineering for advanced electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen-containing molecules are systematically summarized, with special focus on electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation and reduction, electrocatalytic nitric oxide oxidation and reduction, electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, and the construction of C-N bonds. Defects can effectively tune the electronic structure of catalysts, facilitate species diffusion, and provide more adsorption/active sites for reaction intermediates, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic performance. Moreover, objective issues and future trends for optimizing electrocatalyst by defect engineering are proposed, which will contribute to the further development of advanced electrocatalytic conversion of nitrogen-containing molecules.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000871168400001

In pursuit offinding the optimal phase, orientation, and strain conditions ofa Pd substrate for syngas production, we investigate the effects of hydriding and strainon the binding energies (BEs) of CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reactionintermediates on the (111), (100), and (110) surfaces of Pd by using densityfunctional theory calculations. The calculation results show that the BEs are weakenedby hydriding, most significantly on the (111) surface, rendering it more energeticallyfavorable for syngas production than the others at sufficiently negative potentials. It isalso shown that PdH(100) can be more energetically favorable than PdH(111) undercompressive strains at weakly negative potentials owing to the high strainsusceptibilities of the*CO BEs on the surface. These results are explained in termsof the effects of hydriding and strain on the electronic structures of Pd surface atoms and adsorption-induced mechanicalinteractions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000783122600014

Their high surface area can be modified to integrate more surface functional groups to become super absorbers for different water pollutants such as heavy metals, oils, organic materials, pesticides, herbicides, toxic and pharmaceutical materials. Significant advances have also been made in the regeneration and reusability of these functional materials, making them smart materials able to respond to specific stimuli. Smart nanostructured aerogels can be designed to reversibly adsorb and desorb a specific water pollutant under various external stimulations. This review comprehensively discusses the evolution, types, and properties of aerogel functional materials. It highlights the modification approaches on aerogels to suit the desired applications of the water treatment field.

Herein, we used a nickel selenite complex [{Ni(TMEDA)SeO3}(2)] to obtain NiSe nanospheres on three-dimensional carbon cloth via electrodeposition. The performance of the as-prepared electrodes (NiSe-TMEDA/CC) was investigated in alkaline solution for water splitting, exhibiting bifunctional OER and HER activity with small overpotentials of 226 and 30.8 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Using this bifunctional electrode, a water electrolyzer only required a cell voltage of 1.52 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with excellent long term stability. Compared with the traditional separate Ni and Se sources, the single-molecule precursor is beneficial to form uniform NiSe on the substrate. This work provides a reference for the preparation of bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting via single molecule electrodeposition.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000605477500041

Highly efficient electrocatalyst is of great importance for the low-cost and large-scale production of hydrogen. Effective electrocatalysts made of earth abundant elements such as element P have attracted extensive interest. Due to the attractive properties of black phosphorus (BP) including tunable physicochemical characteristics, unique in-plane anisotropic structure, high charge-carrier mobility, and large specific surface area, make it stand out from four allotropes. And the breakthrough in BP exfoliation enables it to be a promising 2D platform for designing flexible and versatile BP-based materials. This review summarizes all these bulk BP, BP nanosheets, BP quantum dots (QDs) as well as BP-based materials as efficient electrocatalysts in the last several years, with their synthesis methods and electrocatalytic properties for water splitting.

Hydrogeochemical investigations show that the evaporite dissolution (halite and gypsum), followed by cation-exchange reactions with reservoir matrix and by sea spray, constitute the main processes that control groundwater mineralization. Data inferred from 18-oxygen and deuterium isotopes in groundwater samples indicated recharge with modern rainfall. Water characterized by lower O-18 and H-2 values is interpreted as recharged by non-evaporated rainfall originating from Atlantic Ocean. Tritium contents, ranging between 0.18 and 3.43 TU, indicate that groundwater in both aquifers derive from post- and pre-nuclear recharge. The study of the carbon isotopes made it possible to estimate the water residence time of the two aquifers studied. Moreover, the calculated ages range from the modern to the late Pleistocene with the dominance of the modern age waters.									14	0	0	0	4	0	14			0891-2556	1878-5212		WOS:000426470400006

Method for crew-escape risk-envelope assessment during ascent								JOURNAL OF SPACECRAFT AND ROCKETS				45	4			822	828		10.2514/1.33753				JUL-AUG 2008	2008	Computational simulations and analyses may be used to quantify the risk envelope for crew escape resulting from an accidental detonation of explosive materials at a specified time during the ascent phase for crew exploration vehicles. Here, a methodology was developed and applied to assess the explosive risk potential, focusing on internal detonations or explosions. The approach was to computationally model the geometry of a launch vehicle and the time evolution of an accident scenario with explosive detonation. A series of detailed detonation simulations were completed for three different crew exploration vehicle launch vehicle configurations. All simulations assumed the formation of an explosive mixture of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. Two different energy-release models were used in this study. One was based on programmed burn with a Jones-Wilkins-Lee analytical description of the reaction-product expansion isentrope, and the other used a volumetric energy source formulation. Based on this methodology and simulations, the predicted pressure field had significant magnitudes in the region of the service module and crew exploration vehicle. In fact, the overpressure is so severe that it would not be a survivable event for the crew.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0022-4650			WOS:000258389600017

The analysis of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra in combination with Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of three different types of titanium oxide species in the faujasite structure exhibiting excitation energies for the charge transfer from the 2p orbitals of oxygen ligands to the 3d orbitals of Ti of around 36 000, 45 000 and 49 000 cm(-1). A reliable evaluation of diffuse reflectance spectra requires the calculation of the Kubelka-Munk spectra from the absolute reflectance of the sample. The different titanium oxide types are proposed to result from monofunctional, bifunctional, and multifunctional bonding of TiCl4 to isolated or neighboring OH groups or to hydroxyl nests with coordination numbers ranging from four to six. The blue shifts in the UV-vis spectra of mononuclear titanium oxide species can be discriminated from those of quantum-sized titania particles.									116	11	0	0	4	0	119			1089-5647			WOS:A1997WL11700007

Herein, BN quantum dots/Ti3C2Tx-MXene (BNQDs/Ti3C2Tx) heterostructure is demonstrated as an efficient and durable NRR catalyst, exhibiting a high NH3 yield of 52.8 +/- 3.3 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) with an FE of 19.1 +/- 1.6% at -0.4 V (vs. RHE), which stand at the high level among all reported BN- and MXene-based NRR catalysts. Theoretical computations reveal that the electronic interactions between BNQDs and Ti3C2Tx enrich the electron density of B atoms at the heterointerface and endow them with enhanced electron-donating capability for N-2 activation and protonation. Meanwhile, the decorated BNQDs can block the active sites of Ti3C2Tx for hydrogen evolution, rendering a high N-2-to-NH3 selectivity.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13				2575-0356		WOS:000743735400001

However, huge amounts of electricity inputs are always necessary for these electrochemical synthetic processes. Therefore, developing efficient electrocatalyst candidates is the key, where the charge-transfer model plays a vital role in the rational design of electrocatalysts. During the past decade, three main achievements have been attained in electrochemical catalysis: (i) Numerous new materials with unique physicochemical properties have been explored, (ii) The systems of activity descriptors and design principles have been successfully established, and (iii) The insights into the underlying catalysis mechanisms have deepened. The charge-transfer model is crucial for these strides and achievements. This short review will systematically discuss the charge-transfer model, including its origin, description, correlation with material properties, acquisition, and representative applications in electrochemical fields. We also make a brief conclusion and outlook for the chargetransfer model in the development of electrochemistry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2451-9103			WOS:000704353800004

Solvothermal synthesis of Cu-doped Co3O4 nanosheets at low reaction temperature for potential supercapacitor applications								APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING				127	5					353	10.1007/s00339-021-04498-6				MAY 2021	2021	Cu-doped Co3O4 (1, 3, 5 and 7 wt%) nanoparticles were synthesized through the decomposition of cobalt (II) acetylacetonate, cobalt (III) acetylacetonate and copper (II) acetylacetonate in the least toxic polar solvent through solvothermal method. XRD analysis confirmed the formation of cubic spinel structure with reduced crystallite size of 20 nm and slight lattice expansion upon Cu doping. The spectral analysis carried out by FTIR and Raman studies expressed the existence of functional group and active vibrational modes. UV-Vis analysis revealed the increase in bandgap value with increasing dopant concentration. Slightly dissociated nanosheets and cubic structure were observed in HR-SEM and HR-TEM analyses with an average particle size of 25 nm. SAED pattern indicated the polycrystalline nature of the synthesized nanoparticles. The weak ferromagnetic nature with low coercivity and remanent ratio is deliberated from magnetic measurement. The Cu dopant was found to enhance the electrochemical performance of Co3O4 nanoparticles with high specific capacitance, since it possesses larger surface area due to reduced particle size.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000641456000003

Effect of Interlayer Co2+ on Structure and Charge Transfer in NiFe Layered Double Hydroxides								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				123	22			13593	13599		10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b01671				JUN 6 2019	2019	The intercalation of Co in NiFe layered double hydroxides (LDH) significantly improves the electrocatalytic performance of the LDH for the oxygen evolution reaction. The mechanism behind the improvement and the structure of the Co-intercalated LDHs, however, is not precisely known. We use classical molecular dynamics (CMD) to study the impact of intercalated Co on the structure of NiFe LDH and the electron transfer process. CMD studies find that the Co ions form small clusters, pushing apart the surrounding hydroxide sheets to form small "pockets" around these clusters, disrupting the planar nature of the sheets in the absence of intercalated Co clusters. The structure of the "pockets" is a strong function of force field parameters and the accuracy of the LDH bulk modulus. We use umbrella sampling to study electron transfer and show that the clusters of Co in the interlayer are important for electron transfer, such that solvent molecules have greater freedom to reorient with a change in charge state, thereby reducing the barrier to electron transfer.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1932-7447			WOS:000470938400026

Cobalt oxide (CoOx) is a promising cocatalyst to protect photoelectrodes and accelerate the charge transfer. CoOx is earth-abundant and stable in extremely alkaline conditions and shows high activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we demonstrate that CoOx directly deposited onto InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well photoanodes exhibits excellent activity and stability in a strong alkaline electrolyte, 1 M NaOH (pH = 13.7), for water oxidation up to 28 h, while a reference sample without the catalyst degraded rapidly in the alkaline electrolyte. Under simulated solar illumination, the CoOx-modified InGaN/GaN quantum well photoanode showed a high photocurrent density of 1.26 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V and an onset potential of -0.03 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode.									16	0	0	0	2	0	16			2574-0962			WOS:000458706700075

However, their catalytic activity and sensing performances still need to be further improved. Herein, we reported the development of unique phosphorus (P)-doped and plasma-etched graphene (denoted as PG-E) as an efficient metal-free electrocatalyst for dopamine (DA) sensing. It was demonstrated that introducing both P-dopants and plasma-engineered defects in graphene could synergistically improve the activity toward electrocatalytic oxidation of DA by increasing the accessible active sites and promoting the electron transport capability. The resulting PG-E modified electrode showed exceptional DA sensing performances with low detection limit, high selectivity and good stability. These results suggested that the synergistic effect of dopants and defects might be an important factor for developing the advanced graphene-based metal-free catalysts for electrochemical sensing.

Due to their strong acidity, redox chemistry, photoactivity, charge distribution and multielectron transformation, POMs have been used as efficient catalysts in a variety of chemical reactions. To meet the requirement of sustainable chemistry, great effort has been focused on immobilization of the active POMs on different solid supports to realize heterogeneous catalysis. This short review summarizes the recent progress on immobilization of POM moieties in crystalline solids with defined crystal structures, including organic-inorganic hybrid materials, POM-based inorganic crystalline solids and POM-encapsulated metal-organic frameworks (POM@MOFs), and their catalytic properties in oxidation, hydrolysis, cyanosilylation, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. As illustrated in the text, these crystalline solids exhibit interesting catalytic properties, such as high activity, stability and selectivity, and simple recovery and easy recycling, which are much superior to those of the corresponding constituent species in most cases.									70	2	0	0	4	0	71			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000378392200001	27230969

However, it remains challenges to simultaneously achieve enhanced activity and stability from Ir based OER catalyst. Herein, the amine molecules directed assembly method is used to coat of ultrasmall Ir nanoparticles (similar to 1.3 nm) on carbon (Ir NP/C). The catalyst with ultralow loading of 13.5 mu g(Ir) cm(-2) exhibits 70 mV lower overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and much longer lifetime than that of commercial IrO2 with high loading of 102 mu g(Ir) cm (-2). Experimental results suggest that the presence of a higher proportion of Ir-N on the top atomic layer of ultrasmall Ir nanoparticles, as evident from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) spectra of Ir NP/C, facilitated the enhanced performance. The findings could promote the understanding and developing of active Ir-based OER nanocatalysts with longer lifetime.

As a precondition a molecular feedback loop must exist, which transfers a small fraction of the energy, which drives the reaction, through the surrounding medium to assist the electron transfer in a non-linear way. This can lead to microscopic self-organization, i.e. to a temporary dissipative structure which may significantly improve electron transfer through a non-equilibrium electron distribution and a decrease of the activation barrier. The problem is theoretically modelled as a Kramers approach in which the friction term may become active. A formula for ''self-organized'' electron transfer is obtained which yields - for finite activation barriers - significantly higher rates than the Marcus formula. The presented model may help to explain how biological catalysts have evolved the ability of generating favourable energy barriers for multielectron transfer near the thermodynamic overall potential.					95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis95th Annual Meeting of the Deutsche-Bunsen-Gesellschaft-fur-Physikalische-Chemie on Primary Processes of Photosynthesis	MAY 16-18, 1996MAY 16-18, 1996	Deut Bunsen Gesell Phys ChemDeut Bunsen Gesell Phys Chem	JENA, GERMANYJENA, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0005-9021			WOS:A1996WB83300029

Bimetallic PGM-free M1M2-NC catalysts and their active sites, however, have been poorly studied to date. The present study explores the active accessible sites of mono- and bimetallic Fe-NC and FeNi-NC catalysts. Combining CO cryo chemisorption, X-ray absorption and Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, we evaluate the number and chemical state of metal sites at the surface of the catalysts along with an estimate of their dispersion and utilization. Fe L-3,L-2-edge X-ray adsorption spectra, Mossbauer spectra and CO desorption all suggested an essentially identical nature of Fe sites in both monometallic Fe-NC and bimetallic FeNi-NC; however, Ni blocks the formation of active sites during the pyrolysis and thus causes a sharp reduction in the accessible metal site density, while with only a minor direct participation as a catalytic site in the final catalyst. We also use the site density utilization factor, phi(SDsurface/bulk), as a measure of the metal site dispersion in PGM-free ORR catalysts. phi(SDsurface/bulk) enables a quantitative evaluation and comparison of distinct catalyst synthesis routes in terms of their ratio of accessible metal sites. It gives guidance for further optimization of the accessible site density of M-NC catalysts.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000607298400031	34168745

As a result, crystal facet and phase engineering have been attracted as unique strategies for designing (photo)electrocatalysts. However, there are few specialized review articles on facet and phase engineering for various water splitting systems so far. In this review, we start by concisely introducing the principle of three water splitting systems. The subsequent section explains notable tactics of crystal facet and phase engineering to modify the intrinsic properties of catalysts and construct the junction. Then, we discuss recent advances in facet and phase-engineered catalysts for water splitting. Finally, the last section outlines the challenges and invigorating perspectives for future research on crystal facets and phase-engineered catalysts for practical water splitting systems. We believe this review enables us to strengthen the basis of crystal facet and phase engineering to promote the development of water splitting cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1466-8033		WOS:000837491800001

Here we show that the ultraconformal cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) protective skin with high inorganic content dramatically enhances the safety of high-energy practical Li-ion pouch cells. We find that the robust CEI skin significantly improves the intrinsic thermal stability, mitigates the evolution of oxygen resulting from phase transition, and effectively suppresses the associated parasitic reactions between the delithiated cathodes and electrolyte. The in-situ CEI engineering strategy is simple and suitable for practical industrial manufacture, and it provides design ideas for aggressive nickel-rich cathodes towards safe and high-energy batteries.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2405-8297			WOS:000703863600006

Calcium manganese oxides are analogous to the systems that perform water-splitting in the natural photosynthesis process. In this work, we report a convenient method to synthesize CaMnO3 perovskite. Biomineralized vaterite was used as the calcium source to synthesize pure CaMnO3 efficiently. In contrast, commercial CaCO3, which contains the calcite phase, led to the formation of a mixture of calcium manganese oxides. The low bandgap energy of pure CaMnO3 (1.21 eV) enabled it to absorb visible light and be employed as a photocatalyst in the photolytic degradation of toxic dyes viz. rhodamine 6G, rhodamine B, methylene blue and methyl orange. The photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine 6G was studied in detail, and 72% dye degradation was observed within 2 h in the presence of pure CaMnO3 in contrast to 46% in the presence of the mixed-phase calcium manganese oxide. The mechanistic pathway of dye degradation was also analysed.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1466-8033		WOS:000652251600001

The influences of operating parameters, including pulse frequency, pulse current density and pulse duty cycle, on the MG removal efficiency were investigated. The results indicate that MG removal efficiency can reach 99.6% after 90 min with the pulse frequency at 10 Hz, pulse current density at 30 mA cm(-2) and pulse duty cycle at 0.6. The pulse degradation processes follow the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Comparison with direct current oxidisation methods, pulse oxidisation methods can enhance MG and COD removal efficiency and reduce the energy consumption. Moreover, pulse oxidisation methods can increase the amount of hydroxyl radicals generation and reduce side reactions (such as oxygen evolution) in the degradation process of MG. Finally, a possible degradation pathway of MG in pulse current modes was proposed based on the intermediate products identified by GC/MS.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0306-7319	1029-0397		WOS:000518265300001

Conventional nanoparticle-based catalysts recently witnessed the dawn of its potential successor-heterogeneous single-atom catalysts (SACs), which allow the maximum possible dispersion of metal atoms on the catalyst surface, possess unparalleled electronic structure and geometric configuration, and exhibit, otherwise, exceptional performance in a range of energy-related applications. Herein, we critically review the use of heterogeneous SACs in the generation and conversion of hydrocarbons, oxygenates, H-2 fuel, ammonia, commodity and fine chemicals, and the electrochemical energy storage in and release from batteries. We describe the importance of those energy-related compounds in the current energy infrastructure and discuss how catalysis-in particular, single-atom catalysis-can be used more effectively in each application. At last, general guidelines and trends guiding the future design of stable and efficient single-atom catalysts for sustainable energy transformations are provided.									125	11	0	0	9	0	126			2542-4351			WOS:000503428000006

On the condition of relatively high Al2O3 in slag, the top slag would have a good kinetic condition. But excessive high Al2O3 in slag would increase total oxygen in stainless steel and cause a more complex series of slag-steel-inclusions reactions. Meanwhile, it is found that high basicity slag has good de-oxidation ability and it also accelerates the transition from high Al2O3 inclusions to low melt point CaO-Al2O3-SiO2-MgO system inclusions. But excessive high basicity would have no effect on T.O and leads high content of [Al], [Mg] in liquid iron and which would promote the MgO-Al2O3 inclusions.					10th International Conference on Molten Slags, Fluxes and Salts10th International Conference on Molten Slags, Fluxes and Salts	MAY 22-25, 2016MAY 22-25, 2016	Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Extract & Proc Div; Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Mat Proc & Mfg DivMinerals Metals & Mat Soc, Extract & Proc Div; Minerals Metals & Mat Soc, Mat Proc & Mfg Div	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	2	0	0	0	0	0	2					978-1-119-33319-7; 978-1-119-30876-8	WOS:000578029000016

Natural Science Edition				21	4			444	453	1007-2861(2015)21:4<444:ZTDZJK>2.0.TX;2-R					2015	2015	Structure and dynamics of near-limit premixed flames in narrow channels are numerically studied. The channel consists of two circular parallel plates, one of which is upward and another is downward. It is possible that the premixed flame is stable when the mixture of fuel gas and oxygen in the channel is ignited. A reaction-diffusion model is used based on the Arrhenius-type chemistry, and attention is focused on the influence of distance between two plates as well as the plate's material and radius. There are mainly two steady solutions for a given distance between the plates, a small flame and a large flame. Linear stability analysis shows that 1D stable flames may exist in the narrow channel, but 2D stable flames do not exist. The dynamical evolution processes of 1D stable, but 2D unstable flames are studied by direct numerical simulations. It is shown that the flame drifts to the boundary as a whole or an old one splits into two new flames that drift to the boundary along the opposite direction.			通过数值方法研究了窄通道中近可燃极限预混火焰的结构和稳定性.窄通道由上、下两个圆形平行平板构成,燃气和氧气组成的混合气体充满窄通道内部,点燃后形成的预混火焰在一定条件下有可能稳定在窄通道内.采用基于Arrhenius单步反应的反应-扩散火焰模型,考察了平板间距、平板材料和平板半径对火焰的影响.结果表明,一定的平板间距下主要有两个火焰的稳态解:一个对应较大的火焰半径,另一个对应较小的火焰半径.通过线性稳定性分析发现,窄通道中存在一维稳定的火焰,但不存在二维稳定的火焰.对一维稳定但二维不稳定的火焰的失稳进行数值模拟可以发现,失稳主要表现为火焰整体向边界漂移,或者一个火焰分裂成两个新的火焰后分别沿相反方向向边界漂移.						0	0	0		0	0	0			1007-2861			CSCD:5514419

Characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamporometric experiments, the effect of Fe doping amount on the electrode activity was investigated. Fe doping on PbO2 electrode improved the electrode morphology, OEP, step current and thus the degradation of p-NP. The optimal Fe doped concentration was 0.02 M, and the electrode prepared under this condition possessed the highest OEP of 2.7 V and p-NP degradation performance. After 90 min treatment, the p-NP degradation efficiency reached 100% with similar energy consumption, and the reaction rate constant increased about 43 times compared with that of the unmodified one. This Fe doped Ti/TNTs/PbO2 anode has a more promising application potential in treatment of wastewater containing biorefractory organic pollutants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the atomic ratio O/C, aromaticity factor, even ring condensation number and ring condensation index increase and atomic ratio H/C decreases with increasing inertinite content in coal; inertinite contains more aromatic ring structure than that of vitrinite; the crystallite structure order of coal char increases slightly with increasing heat treatment temperature. The higher inertinite content in coal is, the lower pyrolysis reactivity of coal is at lower temperature, and yet they have obvious second pyrolysis reactivity in higher temperature. The pyrolysis reaction in primarily devolatilisation phase that comes mainly from the decomposition of containing hydrogen function groups and the secondary devolatilisation at high temperature is mainly the decomposition of stable containing oxygen function groups in coal matrix with higher inertinite.

The lower and recommended measured rates for this reaction produce negligible changes to the stellar yields, whereas the upper limit of the rate affects the production of F-19 and Ne-21. The stellar yields increase by similar to 50% to up to a factor of 4.5 for F-19, and by factors of similar to 2 to 9.6 for Ne-21. While the F-18(alpha, p)Ne-21 reaction competes with O-18 production, the extra protons released are captured by O-18 to facilitate the O-18(p,alpha)N-15(alpha,gamma)F-19 chain. The higher abundances of F-19 obtained using the upper limit of the rate helps to match the [F/O] ratios observed in AGB stars, but only for large C/O ratios. Extramixing processes are proposed to help to solve this problem. Some evidence that the F-18(alpha, p)Ne-21 rate might be closer to its upper limit is provided by the fact that the higher calculated Ne-21/Ne-22 ratios in the He intershell provide an explanation for the Ne isotopic composition of silicon-carbide grains from AGB stars. This needs to be confirmed by future experiments of the F-18(alpha, p)Ne-21 reaction rate. The availability of accurate fluorine yields from AGB stars will be fundamental for interpreting observations of this element in carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000254530600042

However, it is challenging to elucidate the intrinsic stability during operation of a redox flow battery. The symmetrical flow battery cell is a powerful tool that helps to unambiguously determine the cycling stability. Herein, trustworthiness of this technique is critically re-evaluated. Potassium ferrocyanide in alkaline media is used as a case study since i) it is the best performing species for the catholyte of alkaline flow batteries in terms of reversibility, solubility, costs and environmental compatibility and ii) the cycling stability of this species is still under strong debate. Potassium ferrocyanide is found to be stable at pH 14 upon electrochemical cycling when the oxygen evolution reaction is prevented, which should encourage researchers to resume the use of this species. The results also reveal that care should be taken when interpreting results from this powerful technique to avoid misleading conclusions.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000551511800007

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising 2D-material and has received increasing attention due to its high HER activity. Still, the HER activity of MoS2 remains challenging in a wide pH range. Here, we demonstrate that small size MoS2 quantum dots (MSQDs) can serve as a highly electrochemically active and low-cost electrocatalyst for HER over a wide pH range (pH 0-14). The bottom-up strategy was developed to synthesize water-soluble MSQDs from a carbon-free single molecular precursor, avoiding the formations of unwanted carbon quantum dots (CQDs). By taking the structural benefit, the as-synthesized MSQDs exhibit lower overpotentials and a smaller Tafel slope in acidic, basic, and neutral medium. The catalysts show long-term stability in the entire pH range. This study provides a noble strategy to synthesize MSQDs for optimizing its HER activity.									26	1	0	0	2	0	27			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000563095800109

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) characterization shows that nano-silica irradiated in Argon produce relatively stable paramagnetic materials, the quenching rate of which would be accelerated when exposed to air or at elevated temperatures. The addition of irradiated nano-silica into methyl silicone oil in argon significantly increases solution viscosity compared with the non-irradiated controls, suggesting the grafting of silica with silicone oil. The purified products of grafted silica show -CH3 peaks in FT-IR characterization. H-1 and C-13 NMR characterization are also consistent for the detection of -CH3 in grafted nano-silica. These results confirm that paramagnetic materials in nano-silica can migrate to the surface and graft with polymers. This phenomenon is helpful in understanding the influence of irradiation to interface interaction of nano-silica filled composites, also suggests a novel modification method for inorganic nano-materials.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			0032-3861	1873-2291		WOS:000519993100024

A simple one-dimensional model is developed to study the influence of the mixing on the particle growth mechanism. Two functions, one for the variation of the cooling gas concentration along the reactor length, and another for the mean mass temperature variation, are suggested for description of the mixing. The times for mixing (cooling) are estimated with the assumption that the mixing of the flows takes place at lengths in the range of d to 3d (where d is the reactor diameter), and that during the mixing the flow is cooled. The evolution of the particle size distribution function (PSDF) is calculated for different values of mixing (cooling) time. The results obtained show that the mixing process leads to delays in monomer generation on the one hand, and to the impossibility of establishing self-preservation of the PSDF on the other.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0018-1544			WOS:000077688500013

The Mn(O)/Mn(II) and Mn(II)/Mn(III) pairs, which have not been clearly identified hitherto in the literature, have been observed using these techniques. A species observed at 285 nm during oxidation of the Mn(OH)(2)-covered manganese electrode was assigned to MnOOH. This species eventually led to passive films whose major component is MnO2 absorbing at about 400 nm. An accumulation of the passive films was observed at longer electrolysis times. Electrochemical impedance measurements were used to construct a Tafel plot for the manganese oxidation. The polarization resistance reached a minimum at about +0.17 V vs. AglAgCl (saturated KCl) without oxygen evolution. Some kinetic information including resistance-capacitance time constants for the oxidation reaction and an exchange current density are also reported.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0013-4651			WOS:A1997XT45300011

The area of electrochemical CO2RR has seen substantial activity in the past decade, and several good catalysts have been reported. While the focus was initially on the rate and overpotential of electrocatalysis, it is gradually shifting toward the more chemically challenging issue of selectivity. CO2 can be partially reduced to produce several C-1 products like CO, HCOOH, CH3OH, etc. before its complete 8e(-)/8H(+) reduction to CH4. In addition to that, the low-valent electron-rich metal centers deployed to activate CO2, a Lewis acid, are prone to reduce protons, which are a substrate for CO2RR, leading to competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Similarly, the low-valent metal is prone to oxidation by atmospheric O-2 (i.e., it can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction, ORR), necessitating strictly anaerobic conditions for CO2RR. Not only is the requirement of O-2-free reaction conditions impractical, but it also leads to the release of partially reduced O-2 species such as O-2, H2O2, etc., which are reactive and result in oxidative degradation of the catalyst.In this Account, mechanistic investigations of CO2RR by detecting and, often, chemically trapping and characterizing reaction intermediates are used to understand the factors that determine the selectivity in CO2RR. The spectroscopic data obtained from different intermediates have been identified in different CO2RR catalysts to develop an electronic structure selectivity relationship that is deemed to be important for deciding the selectivity of 2e(-)/2H(+) CO2RR. The roles played by the spin state, hydrogen bonding, and heterogenization in determining the rate and selectivity of CO2RR (producing only CO, only HCOOH, or only CH4) are discussed using examples of both iron porphyrin and non-heme bioinspired artificial mimics. In addition, strategies are demonstrated where the competition between CO2RR and HER as well as CO2RR and ORR could be skewed overwhelmingly in favor of CO2RR in both cases.									13	1	0	0	1	0	14			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000742153100001	34989553

The complex reaction network employed by cellular catalysts and the still only moderate predictive power of modelling approaches leaves this tool challenging to engineer. Frequently, large libraries of semi-rationally generated variants are sampled in high-throughput mode in order to then identify improved catalysts. We present a method for space-and time-efficient processing of very large libraries (10(7)) of recombinant cellular catalysts, in which the phenotypic characterisation and the isolation of positive variants for the entire library is done within one minute in a single, highly parallelized operation. Specifically, product formation in nanolitre-sized cultivation vessels is sensed and translated into the formation of catalase as a reporter protein. Exposure to hydrogen peroxide leads to oxygen gas formation and thus to a density shift of the cultivation vessel. Exploiting Archimedes' principle, this density shift and the resulting upward buoyancy force can be used for batch-wise library sampling. We demonstrate the potential of the method for both, screening and selection protocols, and envision a wide applicability of the system for biosensor-based assays.									8	0	0	0	3	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000424985800038	29445212	
B	Jeevarajan, J.A.								Limitations of internal protective devices in commercial low capacity cylindrical lithium-ion cells								Proceedings of the 3rd IAASS Conference 'Building a Safer Space Together'								7 pp.	7 pp.						2009	2009	Cylindrical 18650 lithium-ion cells, especially those with the cobaltate cathode, are internally equipped with a PTC (positive temperature coefficient) and a CID (current interrupt device). Testing of multicell battery configurations has indicated that these devices do not always protect when cells are in series and/or parallel configurations. Extensive studies have been performed at NASA - JSC, in the past two years, to understand the limitations of these internal protective devices. The comprehensive test program showed that the PTCs have voltage limitations and they spontaneously ignite when activated under high- voltage conditions. Although the CID devices themselves do not cause such a failure, they do not protect when the internal reaction is too rapid especially when it involves the evolution of oxygen (at high voltages) and activation of the PTC at the same time.					3rd IAASS Conference 'Building a Safer Space Together'3rd IAASS Conference 'Building a Safer Space Together'	21-23 Oct. 200821-23 Oct. 2008	Canadian Space AgencyCanadian Space Agency	Rome, ItalyRome, Italy	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-92-9221-226-1	INSPEC:10648126

Since over 20 years ago it has become increasingly clear that important contribution to the antitumor effect of PDT is secured by host reaction induced by this therapy and manifested as inflammatory and immune response. Presented is an overview of advances in the understanding of this host response associated with tumor PDT by tracing its evolution from initial breakthroughs and discoveries in the early 1980s, followed by advances preceding recent developments, and concluding with recently acquired knowledge and directions for clinical exploitation. Tribute is given to researchers making important contributions to this field during the last three decades including Drs. Gianfranco Canti, Julia Levy, and Barbara Henderson.

J	Ijomah, MNC; Ijomah, AI								Chemical recycling of galvanized steel scrap								INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY				10	2			159	165						MAR 2003	2003	The chemical recycling of galvanized steel was investigated by preferential dissolution of the galvanized coating (dezincing or degalvanization) in a variety of acidic environments comprising dilute and moderately concentrated nitric, hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. Weight loss immersion tests were conducted for galvanized steel in the various acidic environments. It was generally observed that the more concentrated acids (10% or more) reacted or dezinced much faster with greater inherent attack, on the Steel Substrate while the more dilute acids (2% or less) reacted very slowly with partial or ineffective dezincing. Optimum results were obtained at intermediate (5%) acid concentrations with little or no attack on the underlying steel substrate, except in 5% HNO3. It was suggested that two competing cathodic reactions, hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction, simultaneously occurred in this characteristic oxidizing environment (51% HNO3) leading to high corrosion rates observed, the remedy of which lies in electrolyte deaeration or use of appropriate corrosion inhibitors, These findings were fully supported with optical microscopy. The various factors favouring or hindering the galvanized steel recycling and the scope for possible scrap product utilization were discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0971-457X	0975-0991		WOS:000181978600007

The model considers the joint time evolution of two functions representing O-2 and Si relative concentrations at a depth x in an initially pure crystalline Si sample, exposed to a constant O-2 pressure at its surface. The oxidant species follows a diffusion dynamics on the x-axis, reacting with imobile Si to produce silicon oxide wherever both relative concentrations are different from zero. The equations are exactly solved by numerical iteration and both growth kinetics and relative concentrations profiles are obtained. Deal and Grove model (B.E. Deal and A. S. Grove, J. Appl. Phys. 36, 3770-3778 (1965)) is recovered as an asymptotic limit. Scaling properties of this model equations are explored and experimental growth kinetics obtained for a wide range of growth parameters are shown to be well described by the model, especially for the initial stages of oxide growth.					4th International Symposium on the Physics and Chemistry of SiO2 and the Si-SiO2 Interface4th International Symposium on the Physics and Chemistry of SiO2 and the Si-SiO2 Interface	MAY 15-18, 2000MAY 15-18, 2000	Electrochem Soc, Electr Div; Electrochem Soc, Dielect Sci & Technol DivElectrochem Soc, Electr Div; Electrochem Soc, Dielect Sci & Technol Div	TORONTO, CANADATORONTO, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-0171		1-56677-267-2	WOS:000087729000005		
J	MINSKER, L; PULGARIN, C; PERINGER, P; KIWI, J								INTEGRATED APPROACH USEFUL IN THE MINERALIZATION OF NONBIODEGRADABLE, TOXIC P-NITROTOLUENESULFONIC ACID VIA PHOTOCATALTYIC-BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				18	7			793	800						JUL 1994	1994	Heterogeneous photooxidation of toluene-4-nitro-2-sulfonic acid or p-nitrotoluene-sulfonic acid (p-NTS) using TiO2 P-25 Degussa suspensions was investigated at lambda>290 nm. Photocatalytic degradation took place with pseudo-first order rate constants of 0.12 h-1 at 20-degrees-C and 0.25 h-1 at 50-degrees-C. When H2O2 (6 x 10(-2) M) was added the observed pseudo-first order rate constant was 0.86 h-1 at 20-degrees-C. This confirms that the .OH radical accelerates the photodegradation under study. Insight is provided into the factors affecting the nonbiodegradability of p-NTS and to the role of the TiO2 photoassisted redox reactions determining the kinetics of substrate degradation. Using biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved organic carbon measurements (DOC) it is shown that sewage bacteria do not attack p-NTS. This compound is totally nonbiodegradable by urban and industrial aerobic activated sludges tested in very diverse culture media. Photolytically pretreated solutions have beneficial effects on subsequent biodegradation. The evolution of toxicity in pretreated solutions is reported.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1144-0546			WOS:A1994NY26500003

The morphological aspects of contrived electrodes have been characterized by FESEM.. Electrochemical characterization reveals the substantial performance of S2 electrode (Co25Cu75MnS) as compared to other compositions. After the experimental investigation, the dependence of inherent charge storage mechanism of CCMS on the concentration of Co and Cu have been scrutinized thru stimulating theoretical approaches. Different mathematical models employed to ascertain the dominant charge storage mechanism involved during electrochemical charge storage and scrutinizing their redox reaction stability.

One-step selective phenol hydroxylation using a photo-Fenton system is an attractive and challenging strategy, especially under long-wavelength irradiation. Herein, we report that a highly selective photo-driven Fenton hydroxylation reaction of phenol to DHB can be achieved over NiFe-layered double hydroxide nanosheets (NiFe-NS) under visible-light irradiation with 70% phenol conversion and similar to 99% DHB selectivity. A more interesting finding is that a high phenol conversion (similar to 40%) activity can be maintained even under monochromatic irradiation at 550 nm. The superior photocatalytic activity was attributed to the abundant defects in NiFe-NS, which facilitated the adsorption of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) onto the catalyst surface and promoted the transfer efficiency of photoinduced electrons from the catalyst to H2O2, generating OH radicals to participate in the hydroxylation of phenol.									9	1	0	0	2	0	9			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000598242900005

Here, a copper oxide film (Cu-Tris film) was prepared in-situ from a 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution (pH =12.0) containing 1.0mM Cu2+ and 2.0mM Tris via controlled-potential electrodeposition. The CuTris film showed a significantly low overpotential of 390 mV at a cdrrent density of 1.0 mA/cm(2) for electrocatalytic water oxidation. Simultaneously, a considerably low Tafel slope of 41 mV/decade was achieved. This Cu-Tris film also exhibited a high and stable current derfSity of ca. 7.5 mA/cm(2) at 1.15 V vs. NHE for long-term electrocatalysis (10 h). These results demonstrated the superior performance of the developed Cu-Tris film, which should be attributed to the regulating effect of the five coordinated planar structure of the Cu-Tris complex precursor during the process of electrodeposition.

This extracellular ATP(eATP) is an important signal molecule for many physiological responses in plants. However, whether eATP could also have effects on photosynthesis in plants has not been extensively studied. Methods With bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaves as experiment material, the effects of eATP on the chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and photosynthetic O_2 evolution rate were studied under different light intensities. Important findings The maximal photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield in light adaptation (F_v′/F_m′), effective photochemical quantum yield of PSII (Y(II)), and photochemical quenching coefficient (q_P) gradually decreased,and the electron transport rate (ETR), non-photochemical quenching coefficient (q_N), and the quantum yield of regulated energy dissipation (Y(NPQ)) increased, with increases in light intensity. Treatment of leaves with eATP significantly increased the values of the potential maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F_v/F_m), F_v′/F_m′,Y(II), q_P, ETR, and photosynthetic O_2 evolution rate, but did not affect the values of q_N and Y(NPQ). In contrast,treatment of leaves with beta,gamma-methyleneadenosine triphosphate (AMP-PCP, an inhibitor of eATP receptors) significantly reduced the values of F_v/F_m, F_v′/F_m′, Y(II), ETR, and photosynthetic O_2 evolution rate, but increased the values of q_N and Y(NPQ). These results show that the levels of eATP exert important influences on the photochemical reaction in photosynthesis.			三磷酸腺苷(ATP)不但分布在细胞内部, 而且广泛存在于动物和植物细胞的细胞外基质中。细胞外ATP (eATP)可与细胞膜表面相应的受体结合并激发细胞内的第二信使, 从而调节细胞的多种生理学功能。但目前对于eATP是否也能对植物的光合作用产生影响则研究较少。该文以菜豆(Phaseolus vulgaris)叶片为实验材料, 研究了在不同光强下eATP对菜豆叶片叶绿素荧光特性和光合放氧速率的影响。结果显示, 随着光强的增加, 叶片的光适应下最大光化学效率(F_v′/F_m′)、光系统II (PSII)实际光化学效率(Y(II))、光化学猝灭系数(q_P)均呈现下降趋势, 而电子传递速率(ETR)、非光化学猝灭系数(q_N)以及调节性能量耗散的量子产量(Y(NPQ))随着光强的增加呈上升趋势。与对照相比, eATP的处理可以显著提高菜豆叶片PSII的潜在最大光化学效率(F_v/F_m)、Y(II)、q_P、ETR和光合放氧速率; 但eATP的处理对F_v′/F_m′、q_N以及Y(NPQ)没有显著影响。AMP-PCP (beta,gamma-亚甲基三磷酸腺苷, eATP细胞外受体的抑制剂)的处理显著降低了F_v/F_m、F_v′/F_m′、Y(II)、ETR和光合放氧速率, 同时也显著增加了q_N以及Y(NPQ)的水平。以上结果显示, 植物eATP水平的变化对植物光合作用的光化学反应有着重要的影响。						0	2	0		2	0	2			1005-264X			CSCD:5282378

However, the roles of the cytochrome pathway (CP) and alternative oxidase (AOX) in photosynthesis, in particular in the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, are not separately characterized. We examined the effects of specific inhibition of two respiratory pathways, CP and AOX, on photosynthetic oxygen evolution and the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in broad bean (Vicia faba L.) leaves under various light intensities. Under saturating photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD; 700 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1)), inhibition of either pathway caused a decrease in the steady-state levels of the photosynthetic O-2 evolution rate and the PSH operating efficiency, Phi(II). Because these inhibitors, at the concentrations applied to the leaves, had little effect on photosynthesis in the intact chloroplasts, two respiratory pathways are essential for maintenance of high photosynthetic rates at saturating PPFD. CP or AOX inhibition affected to Chl fluorescence parameters (e.g. photochemical quenching and non-photochemical quenching) differently, suggesting that CP and AOX contribute to photosynthesis in different ways. At low PPFD (100 mu mol photon M-2 s(-1)), only the inhibition of AOX, not CP, lowered the photosynthetic rate and Phi(II). AOX inhibition also decreased the Phi(II)/Phi(I), ratio even at low PPFD levels. These data suggest that AOX inhibition caused the over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and induced the cyclic electron flow around PSI (CEF-PSI) even at the low PPFD. Based on these results, we discuss possible roles for CP and AOX in the light.									91	13	0	0	90	0	102			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000235218800003	16239307

Whereas titanium oxide has been widely used for photocatalytic pollutant degradation, H-2 evolution, and CO2 reduction, few studies have been devoted to TiO2 -based photocatalytic valorization of biomass or biomass-derived platform compounds. Here, we report on surface-controlled photocatalysis of TiO2 for selective valorization of furfurals and vanillin that are lignocellulose-derived key platform compounds. The reaction can be switched from hydrogenation of aldehyde group to C-C coupling by manipulating exposed facets; furanic and aromatic alcohols or coupling products, which are fine chemicals or jet-fuel precursors, could be produced with high selectivity. Our studies elucidate that the facet-dependent density of oxygen vacancies governs the charge distribution and adsorption strength of surface species and thus controls product selectivity. The present work offers an example of selectivity control by engineering TiO2 surfaces for valorization of biomass-derived feedstocks.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2451-9294			WOS:000588426900017

Herein, we reported a facile strategy to perform the flexible crystalline transformation of MOF polyhedra into their crisp-like derivatives. A mild hydrothermal process involved a crystalline change from ZIF-7 to Zn-2(bim)(4) and a morphological change from an individual polyhedron to a string of nanosheets. Based on the crisp-like morphology which possessed abundant accessible active sites, composites such as Zn-2(bim)(4)@ZnS and Zn-2(bim)(4)@CoS could be obtained by further sulfidation and applied in oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) with a lower overpotential (330 mV) and good stability compared with a commercial IrO2 electrode. The well-organized Zn-2(bim)(4) nanosheets with crisp-like morphology demonstrate an interesting crystalline transformation route to construct complicated nanostructures which are hardly achievable by direct synthesis, showing great promise for designing functional derived materials from MOFs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000870766500001

Meanwhile, the electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol is regarded as a green alternative for the conventional synthesis of benzoic acid under moderate conditions. Here, we report the nitrogen-doped nickel-molybdenum oxide (N-Mo-Ni/NF) loaded on Ni foam through a one-step hydrothermal method for the selective electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid in alkaline electrolytes. The N-Mo-Ni/NF electrode shows intriguing electrocatalytic activity and stability at the anode and only requires a low potential of 1.338 V (vs. RHE) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in a 0.1 M benzyl alcohol solution, which is 252 mV lower than that of water oxidation. In addition, a yield of 98.2% of benzoic acid has been obtained with high faradaic efficiency of 98.7%. This work provides a facile strategy to design advanced non-precious electrocatalysts for the oxidation of benzyl alcohol.									2	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000804908200001

Yet a recent study found fossil micrometeorites (MMs) containing the oxidized iron species wustite (FeO) and magnetite (Fe3O4) formed 2.7 billion years ago (Ga). How these MMs became oxidized is uncertain. Abundant O-2 in the upper atmosphere and iron oxidation by CO2 have been suggested. However, photochemical reactions cannot produce sufficient O-2, and oxidation by CO2 can only produce FeO, each individually failing to explain the formation of Fe3O4-only MMs. Using an oxidation model of iron MMs including photochemistry, we show that a >32% CO2 Archean atmosphere and different entry angles can generate the Fe3O4-only and Fe-FeO mixed composition MMs that have been discovered. Oxidation happens in two stages: by CO2 under brief melting, then by O-2. Our results challenge existing constraints on Earth's atmospheric CO2 concentration at 2.7 Ga and support a warm Late Archean despite the 'faint young Sun'.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-9268	1872-7433		WOS:000708833300007

The water oxidation catalyst was prepared by electrochemical deposition of iron on a nickel foil, followed by thermal annealing, leading to the formation of NiO, alpha -Fe2O3, and NiFe2O4 phases. Detailed structural and surface characterization revealed the effect of the addition of different Fe contents and the subsequent implications on the electrocatalytic performance. The optimized integrated photoanode delivered a maximum photocurrent density of 6.2 mA cm(-2) at 0 V applied bias, which corresponds to a 7.7% of Solar-To-Hydrogen conversion efficiency, which remained stable for more than 20 hours. These results pave the way towards large-scale, efficient and low-cost solar energy conversion solutions based on non-critical raw materials.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2633-5409		WOS:000613921500020

In this study, we describe the fabrication of an anthraquinone functionalized COF linked by beta-ketoenamines (AQ-COF), which presents a noodle-like nanofiber structure with staggered AB stacking mode. The as-resultant AQ-COF was efficiently utilized as a metal-free heterogeneous catalyst for selective aerobic oxidation of sulfides under visible-light irradiation. Compared with the precedential AQ-COFDMF with spherical particles, the proposed AQ-COF presents a higher photocatalytic activity with high selectivity to sulfoxides and chemical stability. Further characterization techniques revealed that the unique morphology and structure can greatly enhance charge transfer and separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thus giving rise to the improvement of photocatalytic activity.									60	3	0	0	2	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800007

Regulation is instead substituted by an optimization problem to maximize a biological objective such as biomass accumulation. A recent extension to these methods is called dynamic enzyme-cost FBA (deFBA). This fully dynamic modeling method allows to predict optimal enzyme levels and reaction fluxes under changing environmental conditions. However, this method was designed for well-defined deterministic settings in which dynamics of the environment are exactly known. In this letter, we present a theoretical framework called the robust deFBA which extends the deFBA to handle uncertainty in nutrient availability. We achieve this by combining deFBA with multi-stage model predictive control which explicitly captures the evolution of uncertainty by a scenario tree. The resulting method is capable of predicting robust optimal gene expression levels for rapidly changing environments. We apply these algorithms to a model of the core metabolic process in bacteria under alternating oxygen availability.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2475-1456			WOS:000658897700005

The dissolution proceeds mainly via a local oxygen evolution reaction and subsequent dissolution of the zinc oxide lattice. The present work focuses on the influence of the anion species in the used electrolyte. Several electrolytes (KCl, K2SO4, KNO3, KClO4) were applied. The anion species turned out to be a major factor that influenced the kinetics of the etching process. In K2SO4 solutions a strong limitation of the etching process to the close vicinity of the grain boundaries was observed. However, anodic dissolution in KCl, KNO3, and KClO4 showed an unexpected etching behavior, which lead to the formation of cavern-like structures within the ZnO:Al thin films. This was attributed to different local pH values at the ZnO:Al/electrolyte interface. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a microfluidic photoelectrochemical architecture with 3-D micro flow channels is constructed by interfacial engineering of defective WO3/TiO2 heterostructures on porous carbon fibers. Kelvin probe force microscopy and photoluminescence imaging visually evidence the charge accumulation sites on the nanojunction. This efficient charge separation contributes to a 3-fold enhancement in the yield of glyceraldehyde and 1,3-dihydroxyacetone during glycerol upgrading, together with nearly doubled production of high value-added KA oil and S2O82- oxidant through cyclohexane and HSO4- oxidization, respectively. More importantly, the microfluidic platform with enhanced mass transfer exhibits a typical reaction selectivity of 85 %, which is much higher than the conventional planar protocol. Integrating this microfluidic photoanode with an oxygen reduction cathode leads to a self-sustained photocatalytic fuel cell with remarkably high open circuit voltage (0.9 V) and short-circuit current (1.2 mA cm(-2)).									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591690700005

A deposit of blue and colourless gem corundum (Beluga occurrence) is compared to a similar calc-silicate pod generally lacking corundum but containing nepheline (Bowhead occurrence) and located 170 m to the SSW. Corundum formation was made possible by three equally important sequential metamorphic reactions: (1) formation of nepheline, diopside, and K-feldspar (inferred) at granulite facies peak metamorphic conditions; (2) partial retrograde replacement of the peak assemblage by phlogopite, oligoclase, calcite, and scapolite (Me-50-Me-67) as a result of CO2-, H2O-, Cl-, F-bearing fluid influx; and (3) retrograde breakdown of scapolite + nepheline (with CO2- and H2O-bearing fluid) to form albite, muscovite, corundum, and calcite. Late, low-temperature zeolite mineralization is common in corundum-bearing zones. Oxy-dravite 611B is +3.9 +/- 0.7 parts per thousand.

Electropolishing produces a limited passivation due to formation of a thin layer of amorphous TiO2, which causes only a slight hindrance to the oxygen evolution reaction. Thermal treatment in air at 450degreesC causes a more substantial passivation due to formation of a thick oxide layer, estimated at about 80 nm for a 16 h treatment on the basis of weight increase, disregarding roughness. Data indicate that the film produced by thermal oxidation has probably a duplex structure, with a porous outer layer with inclusions of Ni species and a compact inner layer, in contact with the substrate, consisting of (essentially) nickel free TiO2 rutile.

Herein, SnO2/CuOnanoparticle composites (NCs) with rich heterointerfaces were designed for selectively converting CO2 into liquidus formate. Distinct from only monometallic phase evolved in physically-mixed samples, Cu and Sn atoms at the heterointerfaces were in-situ reduced into alloys under working conditions. With residual SnOx/CuOx stabilizing the CO2.- intermediate, CuSn alloys can obviously suppress the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction and then enhance the catalytic selectivity. In a H-type cell, as-obtained SnO2/CuO NCs exhibit Faraday efficiency (FE) of 89.3 % and current density of 18.34 mA cm(-2) for formate, which is stable for 30 h at -1.0 V vs. RHE. Impressively, the formate current density of 310 mA cm(-2) is achieved in a flow cell. Moreover, constructing efficient samples by the heterointerfaces engineering would provide an inspiration for designing novel electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2196-0216			WOS:000632941200017

On the relation between onset of bubble nucleation and gas supersaturation concentration								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				146				792	797		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.08.147				NOV 10 2014	2014	The time taken for gas bubbles to start forming on an electrode operating in a stagnant aqueous solution is driven by the dissolved gas mass-transfer near the electrode. This is the result of two processes that compete with one another. One adds dissolved gas molecules from the chemical reactions at the electrode surface and the other diffuses these molecules towards the bulk. Using this mechanism, a model is proposed that can predict the dissolved gas supersaturation concentration up to the onset of bubble nucleation at the electrodes (heterogeneous nucleation). Experimental measurement of the bubble onset nucleation time is incorporated within this model to calculate the critical supersaturation concentration for dissolved hydrogen and oxygen gas. The results show a strong link between the applied current density and the supersaturation concentration at the electrode surface. A relation was obtained that predict the onset of bubble nucleation showing an excellent agreement with the measurement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

At last, the SnO_2 modified GF was obtained by oxidation of Sn at 120 ℃ for 24 h. The morphologies of GF before and after modified by SnO_2 were characterized by SEM, and the electrochemical properties of GF modified by SnO_2 were investigated by cyclic voltammogram. The results show that the SnO_2 coating is uniformly formed on the surface of GF. The oxidation peak current increases from 0.053 8 A to 0.070 8 A, which means 31.5% improves before and after SnO_2 modification of GF. The duration time of oxidation enhances after SnO_2 modified, which indicates that SnO_2 performs a catalytic action upon the reaction of vanadium ions. In addition, the potential of oxygen evolution increases from 1.382 V to 1.517 V. Therefore, the electrochemical window of GF electrode in VOSO_4 solution is widened by modification of SnO_2.			采用H_2O_2对石墨毡(GF)进行预处理, 然后在其表面电沉积Sn, 最后在120℃烘箱氧化24h制备出SnO_2修饰的石墨毡电极。通过扫描电镜(SEM)对SnO_2修饰前后的石墨毡表面形貌进行表征, 采用循环伏安法研究了SnO_2修饰后石墨毡电极的电化学性能。结果表明: SnO_2能够均匀地包覆在石墨毡表面;SnO_2修饰石墨毡后V~(4+)/V~(5+)电对的氧化峰的峰电流由0.053 8A增加到0.070 8A, 与未处理石墨毡相比增加了31.5%, 反应峰出峰持续时间提高, 说明SnO_2对V~(4+)/V~(5+)电对电极过程具有一定的催化作用。析氧电位由1.382V增加到了1.517V, 使电极在VOSO_4溶液中的电化学窗口变宽。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3851			CSCD:5130509

Herein, we report a sequential hydrogen-adsorption-assisted bond-weakening strategy. To Pt-3 clusters deposited on Fe-N-5-C surface, due to stronger Pt-H than N-H interaction, H would firstly adsorb on Pt and then on N, which then weakens Pt-Pt and Fe-N bonds, improves atomic mobility, and thus significantly decreases the kinetic barriers for alloying Pt clusters with single Fe species, As a result, Pt alloys can be prepared at a lower temperature, which largely inhibits the size growth and successfully leads to 1.55 nm Pt3Fe and 1.25 nm Pt3Ni intermetallic nanocrystals. Under an ultralow cathodic loading of 0.03 mg(Pt) cm(-2), the H-2-O-2 fuel cell assembled with Pt3Ni cathode delivers extraordinary activity (1.60 A cm(-2)@0.67 V; 13.7 W mg(Pt)(-1) for the whole cell).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2590-2393	2590-2385		WOS:000857268100008

The valence state of Ti ions, crystal structural characteristics, and microwave dielectric properties were discussed. A solid solution with spinel structure was revealed by the Rietveld refinement results. The partial substitution of (Mg0.5Ti0.5)(3+) for Al3+ lowered the sintering temperature and improved the Q x f value of MgAl2O4 ceramic. The MgAl2-x(Mg0.5Ti0.5)(x)O-4 solid solutions with x = 0.06 can be well sintered at 1425 degrees C in an oxygen atmosphere for 8 h and exhibits excellent microwave dielectric properties with epsilon(r) = 9.1, Q x f = 98,000 GHz, tau(f) = -61.36 ppm/degrees C. The sintering temperature of MgAl1.94(Mg0.5Ti0.5)(0.06)O-4 microwave dielectric ceramics was approximately 200 degrees C lower than that of conventional MgAl2O4 ceramics.									12	2	0	0	0	0	13			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000537564300078

Herein, Zn-MnO2 batteries with high durability and high energy density are achieved by supplementing MnO2 deposition and dissolution in a mild aqueous electrolyte. The main finding is that adjusting Mn2+ concentration to a critical range enables a reversible MnO2/Mn2+ redox conversion without the involvement of oxygen evolution. This can recycle the by-products from MnOOH disproportionation (MnOOH -> MnO2 + Mn2+), resulting in a battery with extremely high durability (16 000 cycles without obvious capacity fading), high energy density (602 Wh kg(-1) based on the active mass of the cathode), and high-rate capacity (430 mAh g(-1) at 19.5 A g(-1)). The utilization of a 3D carbon nanotube foam skeleton can accommodate the volume change during MnO2 deposition/dissolution and provide paths for efficient charge and mass transport. This work provides a feasible way to push the development of Zn-MnO2 batteries in mild aqueous electrolytes.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000642315500001

In this work, we propose a 2D van der Waals MoSe2/Ti2CO2 heterojunction that features promising resistance to both electron-hole recombination and photocorrosion existing in TMDs. By means of first-principles calculations, the MoSe2/Ti2CO2 heterojunction is demonstrated to be a direct Z-scheme photocatalyst for overall water splitting with MoSe2 and Ti2CO2 serving as photocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, which is beneficial to electron-hole separation. The ultrafast migration of photo-generated holes from MoSe2 to Ti2CO2 as well as the anti-photocorrosion ability of Ti2CO2 are responsible for photocatalytic stability. This heterojunction is experimentally reachable and exhibits a high solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 12%. The strategy proposed here paves the way for developing 2D photocatalysts for water splitting with high performance and stability in experiments.									30	0	0	0	0	0	30			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000625958900011	34164051

Herein, the in-situ surface-derivation of Ni-Mo bimetal sulfides nanosheets on Co3O4 nanoarrays, which supported on carbon fibers (Ni-Mo-S@Co3O4/CF) was designed and constructed. The as-prepared hybrid catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for both OER and HER under alkaline conditions, with only a small overpotential of 275 mV and 85 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid catalysts assembled full electrolyzer achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )at 1.57 V in an alkaline condition, without decay even after a durability test of 50 h. These results demonstrate that in-situ surface-derivation is a promising strategy for the design of efficient overall water splitting catalysts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mass-transfer reactions that occurred on both inner and outer microelectrodes interfered with each other and showed a "shielding" effect depending on potentials and geometries of microelectrodes. Application of the inner microelectrode of the double microelectrodes for a probing tip of a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) revealed that the shielding effect by the outer microelectrode affected the electrochemistry on the inner microelectrode in the vicinity of the substrate surface. The effect was intensified above the insulator but attenuated above the conductor as the microelectrodes approached in feedback mode of the SECM. Approach to a critical interelectrode distance also intensified the shielding effect in the substrate generation/tip collection mode. An SECM line-scan using a platinum/epoxy resin-model substrate was carried out to investigate the shielding effect on current sensitivity and lateral resolution of an SECM image.

Therefore, developing successful prelithiation methods will greatly benefit the development of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) utilizing Si anodes. In pursuit of this goal, in this study, lithium oxide (Li2O) was added to a LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC622) cathode using a scalable ball-milling approach to compensate for the initial Li loss at the anode. Different milling conditions were tested to evaluate the impact of particle morphology on the additive performance. In addition, Co3O4, a well-known oxygen evolution reaction catalyst, was introduced to facilitate the activation of Li2O. The Li2O + Co3O4 additives successfully delivered an additional capacity of 1116 mAh/g(Li2O) when charged up to 4.3 V in half cells and 1035 mAh/g(Li2O) when charged up to 4.1 V in full cells using Si anodes.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2076-3417		WOS:000735785900001

The doping of nickel ions shows positive effect on the nanostructure and electrochemical properties of the cobalt hexacyanoferrate (CoHCF). The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) indicate that the doping of nickel ions can reduce the grain size of CoHCF microcubes. The as-synthesized NiCoHCF microcubes are studied as electrode materials for supercapacitor showing a high specific capacitance of 129.4 mAh g(-1) (466 F g(-1)) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) and good cycling stability of retaining 87.9% after 2000 cycles in 1 M Na2SO4 under 0-1 V at 2 A g(-1) when the molar ratio of nickel-cobalt is 1:2 mmol.

In the conditions studied, Mn2+ ions had no significant effect on CE over the concentration range of 1-10 g dm(-3). However, a decrease in CE of more than 35% was obtained at 50 g dm(-3). The cathodic polarization curves and the corresponding kinetics analysis demonstrated that this decrease in CE at higher concentrations of Mn2+ ions was due to the strong depolarizing effect of MnO4- ions and other oxidized products of manganese. Moreover, the kinetics analysis of anodic polarization suggested that the presence of Mn2+ ions catalyzed the oxygen evolution reaction. The addition of Mn2+ ions was also observed to change the surface morphology and deposit quality of the electrodeposited zinc, affecting the crystallographic orientation by significantly inhibiting the growth of (002) and (100) planes.

Nevertheless, the challenges such as capacity attenuation and voltage decline have seriously hindered its large-scale applications. Significantly, the thermodynamic instability of the H3 phase inevitably triggers undesirable cationic disordering and oxygen evolution reaction, which further induce a series of problems. Herein, we have systematically reviewed the research progress of NCM811 from the perspective of chemical stabilization of lattice structure and kinetic hindrance of cathode-electrolyte interface, and summarized the relationship between performance fading mechanism and corresponding strategies. Moreover, new ideas for further modification of ameliorating crystal structure stability and further improvement of NCM811 electrochemical properties are provided, which shines a light on the development of Ni-rich materials in LIBs.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000652658200004

In this work, it was proposed a protocol to study the photochemical degradation of polymers using as probes the absorption of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and vinyl, as followed by the infrared spectroscopy. As a result, it is possible to assess the evolution of the chemical groups associated with the polymer degradation comparing the absorption as a function of degradation time, for films with the same thickness, or comparing the absorption of the chemical groups associated with the polymer degradation related to a reference band, for polymer or pieces with different thicknesses. We discuss also the general mechanism of photodegradation for polyolefins; the difference between using the area of the band vs the intensity of the peak; and the construction of a lab-made ageing chamber, and the role of each part.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1984-6835			WOS:000586049800018

Electrolysis was carried out by delivering gaseous CO2 at the cathode with a silver catalyst integrated in a carbon-based gas diffusion layer. Nonprecious nickel foam in a strongly alkaline electrolyte (1 M NaOH) was used to mediate the anode reaction. While a configuration where the anode and cathode were separated by only a bipolar membrane was found to be unfavorable for robust CO2 reduction, a modified configuration with a solid-supported aqueous layer inserted between the silver-based catalyst layer and the bipolar membrane enhanced the cathode selectivity for CO2 reduction to CO. We report higher current densities (200 mA/cm(2)) than previously reported for gas-phase CO2 to CO electrolysis and demonstrate the dependence of long-term stability on adequate hydration of the CO2 inlet stream.									178	9	0	0	12	0	184			2380-8195			WOS:000422814500022

These four-coordinate complexes, (Me4N)(2)[NiLi] (i = 1-3 for complex 1-3), are investigated for electrocatalytic water oxidation in basic phosphate buffer solution. Experimental results show that (Me4N)(2)[NiL1] (1) is a homogeneous catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation. However, under the same condition, 2 and 3 decompose into NiOx nanoparticles, which acts as precatalyst for the electrocatalytic water oxidation. The catalytic mechanism for electrocatalytic water oxidation by 1 is proposed using cyclic voltammetry experiments, kinetic isotope effect and Pourbaix diagram. By constructing the relationship between the molecular structure and stability of these catalysts, nitrogen atom is found to be more beneficial than carboxyl group for the stability of nickel based homogeneous electrochemical water oxidation catalysts.

The results showed that such additions greatly improve the discharge capacity of the battery (from 155 to 190 mAh g(-1)) but only from the second discharge cycle onwards. Capacity fade with subsequent cycling is also greatly reduced. With an aim to understand the role of CeO2 on the discharge-charge characteristics of MnO2 and its mechanism, we have used a range of microscopy, spectroscopy and diffraction-based techniques to study the process. The CeO2 is not modified by multiple discharged and charged cycles. The CeO2 may enhance the discharge-charge performance of the battery by raising the oxygen evolution potential during charging but does not take part directly in the redox reaction.

Although two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal tellurides have recently been proposed as alternative low-cost ORR catalysts, a fundamental study on the origin of the activity is required to further optimize their composition and performance. Herein, we investigated the electronic properties and ORR catalytic performances of a series of exfoliable 2D transition-metal tellurides to uncover the underlying mechanisms by means of density functional theory simulations. Our in-depth analysis shows that the activation of the ORR mainly depends on the partially filled p(z) state of active Te atoms, which can simultaneously accept and donate electrons behaving similarly to both the occupied and unoccupied d orbitals of Pt atoms. This results in a linear relationship between the p(z)-band center and the adsorption free energies of O-2 and intermediates, indicating that the p(z)-band center might be used as an effective descriptor to probe the performance of telluride catalysts. On this basis, we predicted several 2D transition-metal tellurides with promising catalytic performance and reduced precious-metal contents, where NbRhTe4 reaches the top of the activity volcano with a limiting potential of 0.96 V. This study provides theoretical guidance to design high-performing 2D telluride ORR catalysts, and its principle might be applicable to other electrochemical reactions in 2D chalcogenides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000854085000001	36320469

A promising approach is the electrochemical (EC) reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals, particularly hydrocarbons. Here, we report on the selective EC reduction of CO2 to CO on a porous Au nanostructure (pAu) cathode in 0.1 M KHCO3. The pAu cathode anodized at 2.6 V exhibited maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) for conversion of CO2 to CO (up to 100% at -0.75 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Furthermore, commercial Si photovoltaic cells were combined with EC systems (PV-EC) consisting of pAu cathodes and IrO2 anodes. The triple-junction cell and EC system resulted in a solar-to-CO conversion efficiency (SCE) of 5.3% under 1 sun illumination and was operated for 100 h. This study provides a PV-EC CO2 reduction system for CO production and indicates the potential of the PV-EC system for the EC reduction of CO2 to value-added chemicals.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000783849700031	35350324

The charge-discharge mechanism of electrodeposited nickel-cobalt hydroxide electrodes was studied in Na2SO4 0.05 M by localized in situ measurements of pH, pNa and dissolved O-2 during cyclic voltammetry. Local pH and pNa distributions were recorded using micro-potentiometric sensors with liquid membrane, while dissolved O-2 was monitored using a fiber-optic microsensor. These original results highlight how localized potentiometry can provide new insights to better understand the charge mechanism of metal (hydr)oxide electrodes by directly measuring the concentrations/activities of relevant species at the electrode-electrolyte interface during charge-discharge.

The types of the anions (SO42- and Cl-) in the acid solution play critical roles in determining the crystalline structures of the final products. Both of the MnO2 samples were characterized by means of XRD, Raman, FESEM, TEM, BET, XPS and H-2-TPR techniques. Owning to its more abundant surface adsorbed oxygen species, stronger reducibility, larger specific surface area and lower Mn-O bond strength, the alpha-MnO2 nanowires showed enhanced catalytic performance in the dimethyl ether catalytic combustion (T-10 = 200 degrees C and T-90 = 274 degrees C at WHSV = 30,000 ml g(-1) h(-1)), which was much higher than the beta-MnO2 nanorods.									23	1	0	0	3	0	24			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000452936800043

Reactions between the non-metallic inclusions and the rare-earth metals were investigated in a cold-work tool-steel grade (50CrMoV13-1). A rare-earth metal alloy misch metal (Ce, La, Nd, Pr) was used for the inclusion modification. Aluminium oxide non-metallic inclusions that have a negative effect on the mechanical properties usually occur in the investigated steel. The experimental melts were made in a vacuum induction furnace with different rare-earth metal additions (50, 150, 340, 950 and 2900) ppm. The laboratory cast ingots were hot forced and analysed with light and electron microscopy. It was found that misch metal additions influence the size, composition and type of the non-metallic inclusions in the steel. Most importantly, very small inclusions are formed at lower rare-earth metal additions (up to 340 ppm), but at high additions large non-metallic inclusions are formed (2900 ppm).									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			1580-2949	1580-3414		WOS:000470994000021

To enrich the understanding of soot, this work focuses on investigating detailed influences of instantaneous external irradiation (conventional photoflash exposure) on nanostructure as well as oxidation reactivity of nascent soot particles. By detailed soot characterizations flash can reduce the mass of soot and soot nanostructure can be reconstructed substantially without burning. After flash, the degree of soot crystallization increases while the soot reactive rate decreases and the activation energy increases. In addition, nanostructure and oxidative reactivity of soot in air and Ar after flash are different due to their different thermal conductivities.									14	3	0	0	1	0	14			1996-1073			WOS:000406700200132

Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)				21	10										2016 Sep 30	2016	In this work we directly synthesized molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) nanosheets on carbon nanotube film (MoS₂@CNT) via a two-step chemical vapor deposition method (CVD). By etching the obtained MoS₂@CNT into 10% wt HNO₃, the morphology of MoS₂ decorated on CNT bundles was modulated, resulting in more catalytic active MoS₂ edges being exposed for significantly enhanced electrochemical performance. Our results revealed that an 8 h acid etching sample exhibited the best performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, i.e., the current density reached 10 mA/cm under 375 mV over-potential, and the tafel slope was as low as 94 mV/dec. The enhanced behavior was mainly originated from the more catalytic sites in MoS₂ induced by the acid etching treatment and the higher conductivity from the supporting CNT films. Our study provides a new route to produce two-dimensional layers on CNT films with tunable morphology, and thus may open a window for exploring its promising applications in the fields of catalytic-, electronic-, and electrochemical-related fields.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1420-3049		MEDLINE:27706033	27706033

It is widely believed that nanostructured photocatalysts can improve the efficiency of the process and lower the costs. Indeed, nanostructured light absorbers have several advantages over traditional materials. This includes shorter charge transport pathways and larger redox active surface areas. It is also possible to adjust the energetics of small particles via the quantum size effect or with adsorbed ions. At the same time, nanostructured absorbers have significant disadvantages over conventional ones. The larger surface area promotes defect recombination and reduces the photovoltage that can be drawn from the absorber. The smaller size of the particles also makes electron-hole separation more difficult to achieve. This chapter discusses these issues using selected examples from the literature and from the laboratory of the author.									38	1	0	0	1	0	38			0340-1022	1436-5049	978-3-319-23099-3; 978-3-319-23098-6	WOS:000363875500006	25898972

Continuing from the previous works focusing on the subsurface cleavage of diamond after 3DM-DFP, process optimization and surface reaction evolution mechanism as a fundamental building block is investigated, for the first time, for comprehensively understanding this fast-smoothing manner. By systematically adjusting the controlling factor, stronger load (0.3 MPa) and appropriate duration (0.5 h) as well as moderate sliding speed (in the range of 30 to 45 m s(-1)) is found to be able to obtain the smooth surface of SCD without uncontacted traces or break-surface cleavage. Subtle residual clues on SCD surface as a function of progressive DFP procedure indicate that Fe catalytic oxidation mainly produce Fe2O3 and partial intermediate oxides Fe1-yO. Meanwhile, the activated oxygen inserts sp(3) C-C bonds could form C-O or C=O and C-O-V (vacancy) at existing reactive surface sites. The (100) favorable C=O bonds can be rebuilt if (100) surface is reformed, although the C-O bonds associated with non-(100) rough surface would replace them during DFP procedure. The formed C-O-C and concomitant C-O-V as well as the oxidized graphite give rise to the increase of C-O proportion, and finally the covered defective graphitic phase has an approximate C-O/C=O ratio of 1.25. All these are endowed potential value for future upgrading of DFP technique for diamond surface smoothing.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0263-4368	2213-3917		WOS:000633213000001

The presence of many active components with aromatic and oxygen containing functional groups in the extract of M. indica was shown by transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis). Results revealed that with increasing inhibitor concentration and immersion time the inhibition efficiency increased and reached the maximum value of 92% after 24 h in the presence of 1000 ppm inhibitor. It was shown that in the presence of M. indica extract both iron anodic dissolution rate and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction rate efficiently decreased reflecting a mixed inhibition action. The inhibitor adsorption on mild steel followed a Langmuir isotherm. Surface studies revealed the inhibitor film formation on the iron surface resulting in the surface damage decline and increase of hydrophobicity. Also, the theoretical results confirmed the inhibitor adsorption on the steel surface through its reactive sites.									138	2	0	0	7	1	140			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000452782100120

Herein, under visible irradiation (420 nm), the synergy of palladium (Pd) atom cocatalyst and oxygen vacancies (OVs) on In2O3 nanorods enables superior photocatalytic CH4 activation by O-2. The optimized catalyst reaches ca. 100 mu mol h(-1) of C1 oxygenates, with a selectivity of primary products (CH3OH and CH3OOH) up to 82.5%. Mechanism investigation elucidates that such superior photocatalysis is induced by the dedicated function of Pd single atoms and oxygen vacancies on boosting hole and electron transfer, respectively. O-2 is proven to be the only oxygen source for CH3OH production, while H2O acts as the promoter for efficient CH4 activation through center dot OH production and facilitates product desorption as indicated by DFT modeling. This work thus provides new understandings on simultaneous regulation of both activity and selectivity by the synergy of single atom cocatalysts and oxygen vacancies.CH4 oxidation to high value chemicals under mild conditions through photocatalysis confronts critical issues regarding both conversion and selectivity. Here, atomic Pd and oxygen vacancies were integrated on In2O3 nanorods, leading to visible-driven CH4 conversion with a remarkable yield of oxygenates and high selectivity of primary products.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2041-1723		WOS:000802797000018	35614052

Based on the XRD data a 3% lattice expansion is observed for the Pd/C core catalyst upon hydride formation at 0.0 V. In contrast, the expansion was <= 0.6% for all of the core-shell catalysts. The limited extent of the lattice expansion observed suggests that hydride formation, which may occur during periodic active surface area measurements conducting during accelerated aging tests or driven by H-2 crossover in PEM fuel cells, is unlikely to contribute significantly to the degradation of Pd@Pt core-shell electrocatalysts in contrast to the effects of oxide formation.

J	Hull, Caleb M.; Koza, Jakub A.; Switzer, Jay A.								Electrodeposition of epitaxial Co(OH)(2) on gold and conversion to epitaxial CoOOH and Co3O4								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				31	21			3324	3331		10.1557/jmr.2016.335				NOV 2016	2016	An electrodeposition method for growing epitaxial Co(OH)(2) films on single crystalline gold (111), (100), and (110) substrates is described. The films were grown by electrochemical reduction of [Co(en)(3)](3+) in an alkaline electrolyte. The Co(OH)(2) grew with a [0001] out-of-plane orientation on all the gold crystal orientations. The in-plane orientation follows the symmetry of the gold (111), (100), and (110) substrates. The Co(OH)(2) can be converted to CoOOH by electrochemical oxidation in 1 M KOH at 95 degrees C, and after conversion remains epitaxial with a [0001] out-of-plane orientation. The CoOOH film can be further converted to epitaxial Co3O4 with a [111] out-of-plane orientation by decomposition of the CoOOH film in air at 300 degrees C. This synthesis method allows for a simple fabrication of epitaxial catalysts and could be useful to probe the catalytic activity of specific crystal planes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0884-2914	2044-5326		WOS:000388867100005

The band gaps of the prepared ZnSe nanoparticles and Ta2O5 nanosheets are 2.56 eV and 3.54 eV, respectively. When their mass ratio is 5:1, the ZnSe/Ta2O5 photocatalyst with the best photocatalytic performance can be prepared, and its photocatalytic degradation rate of RhB is 7.2 times of ZnSe nanoparticles and 11 times of Ta2O5 nanosheets. In addition, the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of ZnSe/Ta2O5 photocatalyst can reach 1.264 mmol.g(-1).h(-1), which is 1.7 times that of ZnSe nanoparticles and 4.4 times of Ta2O5 nanosheets. Both characterization and theoretical cal-culations confirmed that there is a strong electron transfer at the interface between ZnSe and Ta2O5, which makes the oxygen atoms in Ta2O5 obtain abundant electrons, effectively forming electron transport tunnels, and ulti-mately accelerating the separation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, the energy band structure of the material and the active species in the reaction process are analyzed, and the photocatalytic reaction mechanism of the ZnSe/Ta2O5 photocatalyst is proposed in detail. This work is significance for broadening the practical application scenarios of ZnSe in the field of photocatalysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000797920000005

Here, we present a novel, one-step approach for the synthesis of Pt/C hybrid material by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PE-CVD). The platinum loading, degree of oxidation, and the very narrow particle size distribution are precisely adjusted in the Pt/C hybrid material due to the simultaneous deposition of platinum and carbon during the process. The as-synthesized Pt/C hybrid materials are promising electrocatalysts for use in fuel cell applications as they show significantly improved electrochemical long-term stability compared to the industrial standard HiSPEC 4000. The PE-CVD process is furthermore expected to be extendable to the general deposition of metal-containing carbon materials from other commercially available metal acetylacetonate precursors.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2190-4286			WOS:000577421800001	33014682

Traditional thermocatalytic oxidation requires either expensive noble metal catalysts or a high reaction temperature, while most photocatalytic oxidation suffers from a low efficiency for the purification of high concentration or refractory VOCs (e.g., aromatic compounds). Herein, we present an efficient visible-light-induced photothermocatalytic VOCs degradation way through constructing the fluorine ions and cheap Ag nanoparticles comodified SrTiO3 catalyst (Ag/F-STO). A photothermocatalytic synergistic effect is demonstrated on Ag/F-STO, providing a higher degradation efficiency than the contribution sum of photocatalytic oxidation and thermocatalytic oxidation. A higher toluene degradation rate constant than state-of-the-art photocatalytic toluene oxidation process and a (>) 95% conversion of benzene, toluene, and xylene mineralization are achieved on Ag/F-STO by photothermocatalysis at 90 degrees C upon visible light irradiation. The results provide a way for robust and economic VOCs removal and corresponding catalyst design.									35	1	0	0	7	0	35			0888-5885			WOS:000446142600015

The results showed that the mace-like Fe3O4 nanostructures were obtained by adjusting the NaOH concentration and reaction temperature, and by adding polyethylene glycol-1000. The growth and assembly mechanism of the mace-like Fe3O4 nanostructures was also discussed. Polyethylene glycol-1000 not only acted as a soft template to form Fe3O4 nanorods, but also assisted in the assembly of the Triton X-100-decorated Fe3O4 nanoparticles onto the nanorods. The results of charge-discharge tests showed that the lithium-air battery based on mace-like Fe3O4 nanostructures exhibited a high discharge capacity of 1427 mA h g(-1) in ambient air. The unique one-dimensional mace-like Fe3O4 nanostructures could effectively enhance the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reduction process, which is effective for decreasing the charging potential plateau.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0004-9425	1445-0038		WOS:000378606900011

The reaction consists of oxidation and reduction. The reduction can lead to evolution of hydrogen, reduction of oxygen or precipitation of the metals from the solution. Corrosion monitoring is important aspect in the development of materials. The factors affecting the corrosion properties are acidic, alkaline, or salt content of the medium, rate and motion of the fluid medium, temperature, pH, composition and structure of the metal and its surface conditions. In this research paper corrosion effects on boiler material MS (SA 516 Gr.70) was investigated under chemical salts (NaOH, Na2SNa2CO3). A weight loss method is used to measure the corrosion rate. Polarization Technique was also used to calculate the corrosion rate under chemical salt for varying concentration. The experimental results showed that the corrosion rate increases with increase in the concentration of chemical salt NaOH and Na2S.

Mechanically treated Ebonex was used as a support. The synthesized catalysts were characterized by several bulk and surface analysis, such as the XRD. XPS and SEM. XRD and XPS analysis showed that Cr- and Mn- components are in amorphous and oxidized state, while Pt is predominantly in metallic state. No alloying between Pt and Cr or Mn is registered. The catalysts are electrochemically tested toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water splitting in a PEM electrolytic cell using a commercial Nation 117 as a proton conducting electrolyte. It is seen that the best catalytic activity for the OER exhibits Pt-Cr/Ebonex. It has higher efficiency at lower Pt loading relative to all other compositions, including Pt/Ebonex. The results obtained are explained with electronic interactions between the metallic components and the support, providing a synergetic effect.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0324-1130			WOS:000209082200022

The catalyst exhibited activity in the selective reduction of NO in the temperature range between 473 and 573 K. The temperature was significantly lower than that in the conventional catalysts, such as Pd-loaded zeolites or monolayer-type oxides. Among tested heteropolyacids, H3PW12O40 gave rise to the highest activity in the reaction. The catalytic performance was improved by the addition of water vapor. The generation of highly dispersed PdO species was observed in the Pd K-edge EXAFS spectra, whose structure was similar to those found in the conventional Pd-loaded zeolites catalyst. The reason for the evolution of NO reduction activity over Pd/H3PW12O40/SiO2 was attributed to the formation of NOH+, as measured by IR, in addition to the generation of highly dispersed PdO species at low temperature on the Bronsted acid sites of heteropolyacid.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000227417500024

During chronic deprivation of oxygen, however, the hypometabolic defense mode of the fruit fly Drosophila, the hypoxia-induced behavioral hypothermia of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, and the production of ethanol during anoxia by the crucian carp Carassius carassius all indicate that these animals are also capable of utilizing a suite of genetic and physiological defenses to survive otherwise lethal reductions in tissue oxygenation. Normally, much of an organism's gene response to hypoxia is orchestrated via the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF. Recent developments expand our view of HIF function even further by highlighting regulatory roles for HIF in the hypometabolism of insects, in the molting and the normoxic immune response of crustaceans, and in the control-via the downstream effector gene erythropoietin-of the hypoxic ventilatory response and pulmonary hypertension in mammals.

Herein, Mo2TiC2Tx MXene, is employed as a support for MoNi4 alloy nanocrystals (NCs) to fabricate a unique nanoflower-like MoNi4-MXn electrocatalyst. A remarkably strong built-in electric field is established at the interface of two components, which facilitates the electron transfer from Mo2TiC2Tx to MoNi4. Due to the accumulation of electrons at the MoNi4 sites, the adsorption of the catalytic intermediates and ionic species on MoNi4 is affected consequently. As a result, the MoNi4-MX10 nanohybrid exhibits the lowest overpotential, even lower than 10% Pt/C catalyst at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH solution (122.19 vs 129.07 mV, respectively). Furthermore, a lower Tafel slope of 55.88 mV dec(-1) is reported as compared to that of the 10% Pt/C (65.64 mV dec(-1)). Additionally, the MoNi4-MX10 catalyst also displays extraordinary chemical stability in alkaline solution, with an activity loss of only 0.15% per hour over 300 h of operation. This reflects the great potential of using MXene-based interfacial engineering for the synthesis of a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000765315900001	35254002	
J	Maharrey, S; Behrens, R								Thermal decomposition of energetic materials. 5. Reaction processes of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine below its melting point								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				109	49			11236	11249		10.1021/jp054188q				DEC 15 2005	2005	Through the use of simultaneous thermogravimetry modulated beam mass spectrometry, optical microscopy, hot-stage time-lapsed microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy measurements, the physical and chemical processes that control the thermal decomposition of 1,3,5-trinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (RDX) below its melting point (160-189 degrees C) have been identified. Two gas-phase reactions of RDX are predominant during the early stages of an experiment. One involves the loss of HONO and HNO and leads to the formation of H2O, NO, NO2, and oxy-s-triazine (OST) or s-triazine. The other involves the reaction of NO with RDX to form NO2 and 1-nitroso-3,5-dinitrohexahydro-s-triazine (ONDNTA), which subsequently decomposes to form a set of products of which CH2O and N2O are the most abundant. Products from the gas-phase RDX decomposition reactions, such as ONDNTA, deposit on the surface of the RDX particles and lead to the development of a new set of reaction pathways that occur on the surface of the RDX particles. The initial surface reactions occur on surfaces of those RDX particles in the sample that can accumulate the greatest amount of products from the gas-phase reactions. Initial surface reactions are characterized by the formation of islands of reactivity on the RDX surface and lead to the development of an orange-colored nonvolatile residue (NVR) film on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is most likely formed via the decomposition of ONDNTA on the surface of the RDX particles. The NVR film is a nonstoichiometric and dynamic material, which reacts directly with RDX and ONDNTA, and is composed of remnants from RDX and ONDNTA molecules that have reacted with the NVR. Reactions involving the NVR become dominant during the later stage of the decomposition process. The NVR reacts with RDX to form ONDNTA via abstraction of an oxygen atom from an NO2 group. ONDNTA may undergo rapid loss of N-2 and NO2 with the remaining portion of the molecule being incorporated into the dynamic NVR. The dynamic NVR also decomposes and leads to the formation of H2O, CH2O, N2O, NH2CHO, (CH3)(2)NCHO, (CH3)(2)NNO, C2H2N2O, and (CH3)(3)N or CH3NCH2CH3. The competition between reaction of the dynamic NVR with RDX and its own thermal decomposition manifests itself in a rapid increase in the rate of evolution of the NVR decomposition products as the amount of RDX remaining in the sample nears depletion. The reactions between the NVR film and RDX on the surface of the RDX particles leads to a localized environment that creates a layer of molten RDX on the surface of the particles where reactions associated with the liquid-phase decomposition of RDX may occur. The combination of these reaction processes leads to an acceleration of the reaction rate in the later stage of the decomposition process and creates an apparent reaction rate behavior that has been referred to as autocatalytic in many previous studies of RDX decomposition. A reaction scheme summarizing the reaction pathways that contribute to the decomposition of RDX below its melting point is presented.									48	1	0	0	1	0	49			1089-5639			WOS:000233850900018	16331907

To address this point, the binding of ammonia (NH3)-a possible substrate-water analogue-has been investigated and discussed in the context of putative reaction mechanisms. By time-resolved detection of O-2 formation after light-flash excitation, we discriminate three NH3/NH4+ binding sites jointly characterized by a K-m value around 25 mM (of NH4+), but differing in their influence on the O-2 -formation step. At 100 mM NH4Cl (pH 7.5), we observe (1) a PSII fraction with complete inhibition of O-2-formation, (2) fast O-2-formation with a time constant of 1.7 ms at 20 degrees C (FastPSII), and (3) slow O-2-formation with a time constant of 36 ms at 20 degrees C (Slow-PSII). For the Fast-PSII, we determine an activation enthalpy of 223 +/- 11 meV. Activation enthalpy and entropy of the Fast-PSII are essentially identical to the corresponding figures in the absence NH3/NH4+ binding. For the Slow-PSII, the activation enthalpy is 323 +/- 11 meV and thus significantly increased, whereas the activation entropy remains essentially unchanged. We conclude: (1) The fully-inhibitory binding site could relate to bound NH3 replacing one of the two substrate-water molecules. (2) The Fast-PSII may relate to NH3/NH4+ binding in the S-2-state of PSII followed by unbinding before onset of the O-O bond formation step, but also more intricate mechanisms are not excluded. (3) In the Slow-PSII, NH3/NH4+ binding increases the energetic barrier of the O-O bond formation step significantly.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000475996300001	31034801

The TS discharge is characterized by short (similar to 10 ns) high current (similar to A) pulses initiated by streamer. The time-resolved optical imaging and spectroscopy of the TS discharge revealed that the primary streamer (ionization wave) is followed by the secondary streamer, enabling us to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the reduced electric field strength E/N(t). This was then used for a chemical kinetic model of the primary and the secondary streamer phases of the TS discharge. In this chemical kinetic modeling, we focus on the generation of selected reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) with antibacterial and other biological effects: O, N, NO, NO2, and O-3. We proved that the secondary streamer plays a more important role in the induced chemistry than the primary streamer. In the simulation with the secondary streamer, the densities of RONS were increased by an order of magnitude when compared to the simulation without the secondary streamer, despite the same peak electron densities. The dominant intermediate product of the secondary streamer chemistry is atomic oxygen. Without the spark phase, this would lead to the generation of ozone as the dominant final product. However, in the spark pulse phase following the streamer(s), the chemistry is twisted towards dominant production of NOx.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000440047200001

This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanism for the oxidation of reaction center Chl of PSI, P700, after saturated pulse (SP) light illumination of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 under steady-state photosynthetic conditions. Both P700 and NADPH were transiently oxidized after SP light illumination under CO2-depleted photosynthesis conditions. In contrast, the Chl fluorescence intensity transiently increased. Compared with the wild type, the increase in Chl fluorescence and the oxidations of P700 and NADPH were greatly enhanced in a mutant (Delta flv1/3) deficient in the genes encoding FLAVODIIRON 1 (FLV1) and FLV3 proteins even under high photosynthetic conditions. Furthermore, oxidation of Cyt f was also observed in the mutant. After SP light illumination, a transient suppression of O-2 evolution was also observed in Delta flv1/3. From these observations, we propose that the reduction in the plastquinone (PQ) pool suppresses linear electron flow at the Cyt b(6)/f complex, which we call the reduction-induced suppression of electron flow (RISE) in the PET system. The accumulation of the reduced form of PQ probably suppresses turnover of the Q cycle in the Cyt b(6)/f complex.									47	0	0	0	43	0	47			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000384716300011	26707729

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides-based nano-structures have recently attracted significant interest as robust and durable catalysts for hydrogen evolution. We systematically investigated the platinum (Pt) based dichalcogenides (PtS2, PtSe2 and PtTe2) as highly energetic and robust hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts. PtTe2 catalyst unveiled the rapid hydrogen evolution process with the low overpotentials of 75 and 92 mV (vs. RHE) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the small Tafel slopes of 64 and 59 mV/dec in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively. The fabricated PtTe2 electrocatalyst explored a better catalytic activity than PtS2 and PtSe2. The density functional theory estimations explored that the observed small Gibbs free energy for H-adsorption of PtTe2 was given the prom-inent role to achieve the superior electrocatalytic and excellent stability activity towards hydrogen evolution due to a smaller bandgap and the metallic nature. We believe that this work will offer a key path to use Pt based dichalcogenides for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Such a Synechococcus mutant was able to grow under photoautotrophic conditions. Isolated thylakoid membranes from the mutant required addition of CaCl2 and MnCl2 for photosynthetic O2 evolution, and the detectable L-amino acid oxidase activity in the isolated thylakoid membranes from the mutant was approximately four times higher than in wild-type thylakoids. The results are discussed with respect to our model suggesting that the water-oxidizing enzyme may have evolved from a flavoprotein with L-amino acid dehydrogenase/oxidase activity.									45	0	0	0	42	0	45			0014-5793	1873-3468		WOS:A1991GV80600015	1660410

Eukaryotic PSII complexes contain many subunits not found in their bacterial counterparts, including the proteins PsbP (PSII), PsbQ, PsbS, and PsbW, as well as the highly homologous, low-molecularmass subunits PsbTn1 and PsbTn2 whose function is currently unknown. To determine the function of PsbTn1 and PsbTn2, we generated single and double psbTn1 and psbTn2 knockout mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Cross linking and reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that PsbTn is a lumenal PSII protein situated next to the cytochrome b(559 )subunit PsbE. The removal of the PsbTn proteins decreased the oxygen evolution rate and PSII core phosphorylation level but increased the susceptibility of PSII to photoinhibition and the production of reactive oxygen species. The assembly and stability of PSII were unaffected, indicating that the deficiencies of the psbTn1 psbTn2 double mutants are due to structural changes. Double mutants exhibited a higher rate of nonphotochemical quenching of excited states than the wild type and single mutants, as well as slower state transition kinetics and a lower quantum yield of PSII when grown in the field. Based on these results, we propose that the main function of the PsbTn proteins is to enable PSII to acclimate to light shifts or intense illumination.									10	0	0	0	8	0	10			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000462993100045	30538167

ACS applied materials & interfaces											10.1021/acsami.2c13417				2022-Nov-04	2022	The design of bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions delivering excellent catalytic activity and stability is highly desirable, yet challenged. Herein, we report an amorphous RuO2-encapsulated crystalline Ni0.85Se nanorod structure (termed as a/c-RuO2/Ni0.85Se) for enhanced HER and OER activities. The as-prepared a/c-RuO2/Ni0.85Se nanorods not only demonstrate splendid HER activity (58 mV@10 mA cm-2 vs RHE), OER activity (233 mV@10 mA cm-2 vs RHE), and electrolyzer activity (1.488 V@10 mA cm-2 vs RHE for overall water splitting) but also exhibit long-term stability with negligible performance decay after 50 h continuous test for overall water splitting. In addition, the variation of the d-band center (from the perspective of bonding and antibonding states) is unveiled theoretically by density functional theory calculations upon amorphous RuO2 layers coupling to clarify the increased hydrogen species adsorption for HER activity enhancement. This work represents a new pathway for the fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward green hydrogen generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36331553	36331553

Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)											10.1002/anie.202212162				2022-Oct-13	2022	Strategy that can design powerful photothermal-catalysts to achieve photothermal-effect assisted coupling-catalysis is much desired for the improvement of energy conversion efficiency and redox product value in CO 2 electroreduction system. Herein, a kind of bifunctional viologen-containing covalent organic framework (Ni-2CBpy 2+ -COF) has been prepared and successfully applied in photothermal-assisted co-electrolysis of CO 2 and methanol. Specifically, the FE CO (cathode) and FE HCOOH (anode) for Ni-2CBpy 2+ -COF can reach up to ~100% at 1.9 V with ~31.5% saved overall electricity-consumption when the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced by methanol oxidation. The superior performance could be attributed to the cyclic diquats in Ni-2CBpy 2+ -COF that enhance the photothermal effect (Delta T = 49.1 °C) to accelerate faster charge transfer between catalyst and immediate species as well as higher selectivity towards desired products as revealed by DFT calculations and characterizations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1521-3773		MEDLINE:36229417	36229417

The electrode material demonstrated an onset potential for the OER of 1.51 V vs. RHE (overpotential eta = 0.28 V) and an outstanding overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10) = 0.33 V), ultimately reaching a considerably high current density of 600 mA cm(-2) at 2.05 V vs. RHE. The prepared electrocatalyst demonstrated maintained catalytic activity in a highly caustic 1 M KOH solution for at least 7 hours of continuous controlled current electrolysis. This approach is synthetically appealing due to its applicability to several other systems through combining functional microporous MOF deposition on a conductive carbon support with minimal modifications, opening the door for cheap and efficient heterogeneous electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000834526400001

Herein, MXene nanosheets as a bifunctional surface modifier were grafted onto ZnO nanorod arrays for enhanced PEC water oxidation performance. As a hole transfer material, the MXene nanosheets combine with ZnO nanorods to construct a heterojunction for restraining the recombination of photogenerated charges and boosting charge separation. Furthermore, as a photothermal material, the MXene nanosheets can produce a lot of heat for elevating the surface temperature of photoanodes in situ under extra near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, thus accelerating the charge transfer and improving the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. As a result, the photocurrent density, durability, bulk charge separation, and surface charge injection efficiency of the ZnO/MXene-NIR photoanode outperform significantly those of pure ZnO photoanodes. This proof-of-concept work may shed light on the development of advanced semiconductor-based composite materials with the synergy of the photoelectric and photothermal effects for solar energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2574-0970		WOS:000833914000001

Herein, we develop the ultrafine MCu (M = Pt, Au, and Pd) alloy nanoparticles anchored on the porous N-doped carbon nanofibers (MCu/p-NCNFs) by the electroless deposition method. The as-prepared MCu alloy nanoparticles possess ultrafine particles sizes (<10 nm) and are uniformly anchored on p-NCNFs, which are derived from electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Owing to the desired composition and structure, the as-prepared PtCu/p-NCNFs with an ultrafine alloy size (approximate to 3.5 nm) exhibits significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability toward methanol electrooxidation as well as the outstanding CO antipoisoning ability. This work offers a new general strategy for the fabrication of ultrafine alloy nanoparticles on a porous nitrogen-doped carbon support as highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy-related applications.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000549942500017

Using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that those cations significantly affect the EDL capacitance in the case of single-crystalline Cu(111), Cu(100), Au(111), Pt(111), stepped Pt(775), and kinked Pt(12 10 5) electrodes in 0.05 M MeClO4 (Me+ = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) electrolytes. For all the electrodes, the capacitance always linearly increases with decreasing hydration energy of Me+ in the following order: Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Cs+. Moreover, we estimate the effective concentrations of the alkali metal cations near the electrode surfaces by correlating the capacitances with the relative permittivity. For all the electrodes, the concentrations near the electrode surface were calculated to be similar to 60 to 80 times higher than in the bulk solutions.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000541745800029

Detailed characterization by means of XRD, TEM, Raman, UV-vis, N-2 physisorption, and XPS measurements revealed that the synthesized plasmonic MoxW1-xO3-y hybrid showed strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPRs). It was demonstrated that such strong LSPRs was generated from crystal vacancies, mainly including mutual doping vacancies of molybdenum ions and tungsten ions and oxygen vacancies. More importantly, the LSPR absorption intensity of MoxW1-xO3-y was almost 20, 16, and 8 times larger than that of as-synthesized MoO3-x, WO3-x, and our previously reported MoO3-x nanosheets (NS), respectively. To the best of our knowledge, such materials exhibiting strong LSPR absorption intensity have never been reported elsewhere.

Hexatriacontane (C36), octadecyloctadecanoate (OOD), and octadecyloctadecanamide (OAD) have been chosen as model compounds of the following polymers: high density polyethylene (HDPE), polycaprolactone and two polyamides [nylon 6 (N6) and nylon 12 (N12)]. Surface degradation and functionalization have been followed using gravimetry, optical emission spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, XPS, and contact angle measurements. The presence of ester or amide functions in the composition of the polymers has an influence on the degradation which starts on the functions. The mechanisms of formation of the degradation products CO and CO2, followed by mass spectrometry, are the same for all the investigated samples. The competition between degradation and functionalization limits the evolution of the O/C ratio and of the surface energy. A contact angle titration technique showed the formation during plasma treatment of functions which can participate in an acid/base reaction.									21	0	0	0	1	1	21			1060-1325			WOS:A1997WN22000008

The stability of monoperoxyketals towards olefinations and organometallic additions allows a new approach to peroxide synthesis based upon formation of C-C or C=C bonds in the presence of protected hydroperoxides, a strategy which has been successfully applied to the synthesis of the unstable eicosanoids 15(S)-HPETE and 5(S)-HPETE. Peroxyketals are also capable of mediating C-C bond formation; ionization of peroxyketals in the presence of Lewis acids produces peroxycarbenium ion intermediates able to undergo both inter- and intramolecular trapping with electron-rich alkenes. The lack of enantioselective approaches to peroxide-containing synthons continues to impose a serious constraint on our approaches to peroxide natural products and the account closes with a discussion of new methods for asymmetric chemical peroxidation.									30	0	0	0	14	0	30			0936-5214			WOS:A1995TC01900003

Methanol chemisorbs associatively (at least at relatively high coverage) on NiAl(110) at 120 K and transforms into surface methoxy by 200 K. Decomposition of the methoxy overlayer leads to the evolution of gaseous H-2, CO, CH4, and CH3 radicals, in addition to the deposition of surface oxygen and carbonaceous species. The formation of C2H4 is also observed after a high coverage of methoxy decomposes on NiAl(110). Methyl radical desorption occurs near 570 K and CH4 desorbs near 350 K from NiAl(110). The low-temperature CH4 desorption peak indicates that the C-O bond of a fraction of surface methoxy is cleaved below 350 K on NiAl(110), in contrast to monometallic Al and Ni, emphasizing the unique reactivity of this alloy surface,									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0022-3654			WOS:A1994PK74000048		
J	Roch, P								Various aspects of bivalve mollusk immunity								BULLETIN DE LA SOCIETE ZOOLOGIQUE DE FRANCE				124	4			313	324						1999	1999	The outcomes of marine bivalve farming are not secure, principally due to infectious diseases. All micro-organisms are involved, from bacteria to viruses, protozoans and fungi. To recover from infections, invertebrates do not possess acquired immunity, but they are capable of potent non specific reactions, both humoral and cellular, belonging to the so-called innate immunity. Also present in vertebrates, innate immune reactions an considered its complementary to the acquired immune ones.Mollusk hemocytes include several sub-populations according to morphological criteria. The percentages of these sub-populations were modified by the infection, putting in evidence the central role of these immune competent cells. As a general phenomenon, phagocytosis involve intra-hemocytic generation of reactive intermediate oxygen radicals which participated to the invader destruction. Meanwhile, some micro-organisms were capable of inhibiting the generation of radicals, escaping their toxicity and consequently succeeding in their pathogenicity.Stress proteins are involved in preserving the protein structures. Heal shock induced the production of specific proteins into bivalve hemocytes. Such phenomenon would normally be used in the field according to the season or in relationship with recovery during tidal emersion.Mollusks also possessed a large panel of molecular weapons, some of them being cytotoxic, others displaying antimicrobial activity. For instance, the mussel plasma contained a potent cytolytic activity due to a molecular complex of 320 kDa, acting by oligomerization at the cell membrane level, leading to the Formation of transmembrane pores.The mussel antibiotic activity involved numerous peptides belonging to several molecular families. Stored in the hemocyte granules, their release was triggered by pathogen entry but not by a sham injection. Closed to the insect cyclic peptides, the mussel peptides were originals as possessing eight cysteines instead of six, which argued in favour of a more compact molecular structure. Another characteristic was the constant existence of two extension sequences as reported only for Limulus tachiplesin.Until recently, the bivalve immune capacities were largely unknown.

J	Boy, G. A.; Doule, O.					Doule, Ondrej/0000-0003-4601-8014			HOW CAN SPACE CONTRIBUTE TO A POSSIBLE SOCIO-TECHNICAL FUTURE ON EARTH?								TRAVAIL HUMAIN				77	3			281	298						2014	2014	Traditional ergonomics fits into the continuity of the relationship between people, artifacts, which they build, their environment and societies. The current unprecedented technological development is breaking this continuity. We must think of human evolution and its relationship to work in new ways that space exploration has already begun to shape. This article outlines elementary strategies that explain how and why space exploration is essential for humankind's growth, evolution and sustainable development, not only at the individual ergonmic level but also at the societal level. Prospective ergonomics needs to take into account these strategies. We claim that if we place any living entity out of its natural environment - where it is adapted to live in-, this entity reacts to the new environment - where it is not adapted to live in- in a specific way to defend, adapt and survive. Not only such survival boundaries and new adaptation capabilities should be discovered, but also life requirements in nominal environments can be better understood. During the NASA Apollo program, humans already extended their living environment to the Moon. We do adapt to a new environment by using a "technological bridge" that facilitates and extends our "adaptation" capabilities much more rapidly than what natural evolution would require whenever possible. In space for example, it is mandatory to extend our living and working environment, but how far can we do this? Can we live everywhere? What are the fundamental limitations and possibilities that needed to be identified? For example, are we limited to habitable zones and regions in our solar system and galaxy? Are we able to fully adapt to microgravity? What are the technological possibilities needed to develop to have sustainable oxygen and water supply? Ultimately, what does it mean to be a human being in the Universe and on Earth in particular? We consider that these questions are crucial in the beginning of the 21st century because our planet Earth is changing rapidly when we consider several para- meters such as our global demography, constantly degraded ecology and uncontrollable economy. We are facing a blank slate exactly in the same way as when we analyze a possible life on Mars. We need to better understand human limitations and capabilities in both natural and artificial worlds that we have generated, and nature provides either nominally or by reaction to our expanding socio-technical ways of living.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0041-1868	2104-3663		WOS:000349818200005

The H-2 evolution rate of 10 wt% CdS/g-C3N4 is 21 times greater than pure g-C3N4 and 4 times greater than that of pure CdS. Key factors responsible for the enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the improved charge separation and increased surface area of CdS/g-C3N4 nanocomposites. These findings may serve as a platform for the fabrication of other photocatalytic multi-material nanocomposites in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	OQUIST, G; CHOW, WS				Chow, Wah Soon/D-2010-2009				ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE QUANTUM YIELD OF PHOTOSYSTEM-II ELECTRON-TRANSPORT, AS DETERMINED BY CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE AND THE QUANTUM YIELD OF CO2-DEPENDENT O-2 EVOLUTION								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				33	1			51	62		10.1007/BF00032982				JUL 1992	1992	We tested the two empirical models of the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis, previously published by Weis E and Berry JA 1987 (Biochim Biophys Acta 894: 198-208) and Genty B et al. 1989 (Biochim Biophys Acta 990: 87-92). These were applied to data from different species representing different states of light acclimation, to species with C3 or C4 photosynthesis, and to wild-type and a chlorophyll b-less chlorina mutant of barley. Photosynthesis measured as CO2-saturated O2 evolution and modulated fluorescence were simultaneously monitored over a range of photon flux densities. The quantum yields of O2, evolution (OO2) were based on absorbed photons, and the fluorescence parameters for photochemical (q(p)) and non-photochemical (q(N)) quenching, as well as the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence during steady-state illumination (F(v)'/F(m)'), were determined. In accordance with the Weis and Berry model, most plants studied exhibited an approximately linear relationship between OO2/q(p) (i.e., the yield of O2 evolution by open Photosystem II reaction centres) and q(N) except for wild-type barley that showed a non-linear relationship. In contrast to the linear relationship reported by Genty et al. for q(p) X F(v)'/F(m)' (i.e., the quantum yield of Photosystem II electron transport) and OCO2, we found a non-linear relationship between qp x F(v)'/F(m)' and OO2 for all plants, except for the chlorina mutant of barley, which showed a largely linear relationship. The curvilinearity of wild-type barley deviated somewhat from that of other species tested. The non-linear part of the relationship was confined to low, limiting photon flux densities, whereas at higher light levels the relationship was linear. Photoinhibition did not change the overall shape of the relationship between q(p) x F(v)/F(m)' and OO2 except that the maximum values of the quantum yields of Photosystem II electron transport and photosynthetic O2 evolution decreased in proportion to the degree of photoinhibition. This implies that the quantum yield of Photosystem II electron transport under high light conditions may be similar for photoinhibited and non-inhibited plants. Based on our experimental results and theoretical analyses of photochemical and non-photochemical fluoresce quenching processes, we conclude that both models, although not universal for all plants, provide useful means for the prediction of photosynthesis from fluorescence parameters. However, we also discuss that conditions which alter one or more of the rate constants that determine the various fluorescence parameters, as well as differential light penetration in assays for oxygen evolution and fluorescence emission, may have direct effect on the relationships of the two models.									87	2	0	0	80	0	88			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:A1992JJ90600005	24408447	
J	Heath, AR; Rumball, JA; Browner, RE								A method for measuring HCN(g) emission from CIP/CIL tanks								MINERALS ENGINEERING				11	8			749	761		10.1016/S0892-6875(98)00060-0				AUG 1998	1998	Hydrogen cyanide gas (HCN(g)) is released from CIP/CIL slurries through either entrainment in the air/oxygen injected into the tanks, or through direct evolution from the pulp surface.The HCN(g) released by entrainment has been measured by placing capped pipes over aerated/oxygenated tanks to collect the evolved gas. The collected gas was passed through a scrubber to remove the HCN(g). The scrubber solution was then titrated for cyanide, giving a measure of the HCN(g)) released by aeration/oxygenation.HCN(g) evolved directly from the pulp surface was measured using capped pipes that were modified to have nitrogen injected into the pipe close to the slurry surface. The injected nitrogen then carried the HCN(g) from the pulp surface to the scrubber. The nitrogen was injected at a rate sufficient to ensure that HCN(g) loss from the surface was under diffusion control.HCN(g) emission from the tanks of the CIP circuit surveyed accounted for approximately 1 % of the total cyanide added, with the majority of that being evolved directly from the pulp surface. The rate of HCN(g) evolution from the tanks was found to be directly proportional to the HCN(aq) concentration in the pulp liquor. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mallee wood (4.75-5.60 mm) from Western Australia was gasified in a fluidised-bed reactor at 600-900 degrees C in O-containing (pure CO2, 15% H2O-Ar) and non-O-containing atmospheres (15% H-2-Ar). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was applied to obtain detailed information about the nature of oxygen bonding with carbon as well as the content of oxygen species in char. The similar O/C ratio of char from XPS and elemental analysis indicated the relative chemical uniformity between char surface and char matrix. The deconvolution results of the O 1s spectra showed that the reactivity of the inherent aromatic C-O structure was much higher than that of the aromatic C=O structure during gasification. The amount of aromatic C-O structure left in char during gasification in non-O-containing atmosphere was lower than that in O-containing atmosphere while the consumption of aromatic C=O structure was proportional to the progress of gasification, regardless of the atmosphere. The newly formed C-O structure in char during the gasification in the O-containing atmosphere was likely to be responsible for the high gasification reactivity. The well-dispersed alkali earth metallic species could be carbonated to form CaCO3 and MgCO3 on char surface once the char was exposed to CO2 at 900 degrees C.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			0378-3820	1873-7188		WOS:000425205300024

Among others, the research is focused on smart combination of simple compounds towards formation of the photoactive materials. Following that, our work concerns the optimized manipulation of laser light coupled with the iron sputtering to transform titania that is mostly UV-active, as well as exhibiting poor oxygen evolution reaction to the material responding to solar light, and that can be further used in water splitting process. The preparation route of the material was based on anodization providing well organized system of nanotubes, while magnetron sputtering ensures formation of thin iron films. The last step covering pulsed laser treatment of 355 nm wavelength significantly changes the material morphology and structure, inducing partial melting and formation of oxygen vacancies in the elementary cell. Depending on the applied fluence, anatase, rutile, and hematite phases were recognized in the final product. The formation of a re-solidified layer on the surface of the nanotubes, in which thickness depends on the laser fluence, was shown by microstructure studies. Although a drastic decrement of light absorption was recorded especially in UV range, laser-annealed samples have shown activity under visible light even 20 times higher than bare titania. Electrochemical analysis has shown that the improvement of photoresponse originates mainly from over an order of magnitude higher charge carrier density as revealed by Mott-Schottky analysis. The results show that intense laser light can modulate the semiconductor properties significantly and can be considered as a promising tool towards activation of initially inactive material for the visible light harvesting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1996-1944		WOS:000580948800001	32927898	
J	Tiwari, S; Mohanty, P								Cobalt induced changes in photosystem activity in Synechocystis PCC 6803: Alterations in energy distribution and stoichiometry								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				50	3			243	256		10.1007/BF00033123				DEC 1996	1996	Adaptive responses to excess (supraoptimal) level of cobalt supplied to the growth medium were studied in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. Growth of cells in the medium containing 10 mu M CoCl2 led to a large stimulation (50%) in O-2-evolution and an overall increase (similar to 30%) in the photosynthetic electron transport rates. Analysis of variable Chi a fluorescence yield of PS II and immune-detection of Photosystem II (PS II) reaction-center protein D1, showed a small increase (15-20%) in the number of PS II units in cobalt-grown cells. Cobalt-grown cells, therefore, had a slightly elevated PS II/PS I ratio compared to control.We observed alteration in the extent of energy distribution between the two photosystems in the cobalt grown cells. Energy was preferentially distributed in favour of PS II accompanied by a reduction in the extent of energy transfer from PS II to PS I in cobalt-grown cells. These cells also showed a smaller PS I absorption cross-section and a smaller size of intersystem electron pool than the control cells. Thus, our results suggest that supplementation of 10 mu M CoCl2, to the normal growth medium causes multiple changes involving small increase in PS II to PS I ratio, enhanced funneling of energy to PS II and an increase in PS I electron transport, decrease PS I cross section and reduction in intersystem pool size. The cumulative effects of these alterations cause stimulation in electron transport and O-2 evolution.									12	0	0	0	13	1	14			0166-8595			WOS:A1996WV51700005	24271963	
J	Lizasa, Mitsuhiro; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Noguchi, Takumi				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Orientations of Carboxylate Groups Coupled to the Mn Cluster in the Photosynthetic Oxygen-Evolving Center As Studied by Polarized ATR-FTIR Spectroscopy								BIOCHEMISTRY				49	14			3074	3082		10.1021/bi1002647				APR 13 2010	2010	It is essential to clarify the structures and interactions of amino acids surrounding the Mn cluster in photosystem II (PSI I) to understand the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic oxygen evolution. In this study, polarized attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied for the first time to PSII to investigate the orientation of carboxylate groups coupled to the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster. PSII membranes from spinach were oriented on the surface of a silicon ATR crystal, and flash-induced polarized ATR-FTIR difference spectra for the S-1 -> S-2 transition (S-2/S-1 spectra) were obtained. The distribution of membrane orientations by mosaic spread was estimated from the semiquinone CO peak in polarized Q(A)(-)/Q(A) difference spectra recorded using the same oriented sample by buffer exchange. The orientations of carboxylate groups coupled to the Mn cluster were estimated from the dichroic ratios of the symmetric COO- bands in the polarized S-2/S-1 ATR-FTIR spectra. We found that most of the carboxylate groups perturbed during the S-1 -> S-2 transition, due to direct ligation to the Mn cluster or though a hydrogen bond network, have orientations in a relatively narrow angle range of 34-48 degrees with respect to the membrane normal. Implications of the obtained orientations and the changes upon formation of S-2 are discussed on the basis of the information from previous FTIR studies and the X-ray structures. The results in this study show that polarized ATR-FTIR difference spectroscopy is a fruitful method for investigating the orientations and their reaction-induced changes in redox cofactors and coupled amino acid side chains in photosynthetic proteins.									23	0	0	0	11	0	23			0006-2960			WOS:000276258800011	20232849

However, restricted utilization efficiency of solar energy and quick recombination of photogenerated carriers of catalysts have restricted its application in photocatalytic pollutant degradation coupled hydrogen evolution. In this work, we synthesized a 0D Bi3TaO7 nanodots-decorated 3D ZnIn2S4 nanoflowers photocatalyst using a simple two-step solvothermal method. The simultaneously photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics (tetracycline) coupled with hydrogen generation was efficiently realized over the resultant S-scheme ZnIn2S4/Bi3TaO7 composites. The relationship between S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts and photocatalytic pollutant degradation coupled hydrogen evolution will be discussed. As a result, optimized ZB20 composite achieves highly efficient TC degradation rate >90% after ten cycles coupled with simultaneous H2 evolution (13.7 mu mol g-1h- 1) with Pt cocatalyst. Furthermore, interfacial transfer mechanism of S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts will be carefully examined combining in-situ characterization techniques and DFT study.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000800345700001

In this approach, species are extracted from solution using electrospray ionization and cooled in a 30 K ion trap. The infrared spectrum is then obtained by monitoring the photoinduced evaporation of a single, weakly bound N-2 molecule as a function of laser wavelength. Because the resulting CIVP action spectrum is linear in laser fluence, the pattern of well-resolved transitions can be directly compared with harmonic spectra calculated for predicted local minima using density functional theory (DM. The assignment of the O-O stretching band derived from the activated O-2 ligand is established by following the evolution of the bands with (18)Q(2) substitution, and the energy of this transition indicates that O-2 is bound side-on to the Mn center. The successful application of CIVP to this class of compounds opens the way for sensitive spectroscopic characterization of weakly abundant species in complex solution environments.

The layers of g-C3N4 are thinned and the Pt nanoparticles simultaneously become tightly bound to g-C3N4 by secondary calcination in the process of synthesizing the g-C3N4-Pt photocatalyst. Analysis of the morphological structure and instrumental characterization of the optical performance revealed that the Pt nanoparticles were successfully loaded and well dispersed on the surface of g-C3N4. Furthermore, the absorption wavelength range of the g-C3N4-Pt photocatalyst in visible light was widened and the absorption increased. The activity and photostability of the g-C3N4-Pt photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation (420nm) were excellent.

The CoCrAlY high temperature corrosion resistance coatings were produced onto the nickel-based superalloy substrate by high velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF). It suggests that the TGO usually consists of a great number of chromium oxides, cobalt oxides and spinel oxides besides alumina during the initial period of the high temperature oxidation if the specimens are not subjected to the appropriate vacuum pre-oxidation process. Furthermore, the amount of alumina is strongly dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen; while the CoCr2O4 spinel oxides are usually formed under the conditions of higher partial pressure of oxygen during the initial period and the lower partial pressure of oxygen during the subsequent period of the isothermal oxidation. After the appropriate vacuum pre-oxidation process, the TGO is mainly composed of alumina that contains lower Y element, while alumina that contains higher Y element sporadically distributes, and the spinel oxides cannot be found. After a longer period of the isothermal oxidation, a small amount of porous CoCr2O4 and the chrome oxide sporadically distribute near the continuous alumina. Additionally, after the appropriate vacuum pre-oxidation process, the TGO growth rate is relatively slow.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000366760200019

The NiFeOx modified hematite photoanode was prepared by a two-step process, which consisted of a hydrothermal method and a subsequent NiFeO(x)loading step. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the resulting photoanode. The highest photocurrent increment and lowest onset potential were observed with 30 mM NiFeOx precursor treatment. Increasing the loading content in a range from 10 to 90 mM, the photocurrent density increases from 0.998 for the pristine alpha-Fe2O3 to 1.126 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V vs RHE (i.e., 12.7% increment) with 30 mM NiFeOx precursor treatment. Concomitant with this improvement was a cathode shift in the onset potential by nearly 55 mV and higher incident-photon-to-current efficiencies. Hematite photoanodes after NiFeOx deposition showed better performance than pristine samples, because of a lower overpotential for water oxidation resulted from NiFeOx modifying.

Variation in voltinism phenotypes along latitudinal gradients may be generated by developmental traits at critical life stages, such as eggs. Both voltinism and egg development are thermally determined traits, yet independently derived models of voltinism and thermal adaptation refer to the evolution of dormancy and thermal sensitivity of development rate, respectively, as independent influences on life history. To reconcile these models and test their respective predictions, we characterized patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate along a latitudinal temperature gradient using the matchstick grasshopper genus Warramaba. We found remarkably strong variation in voltinism patterns, as well as corresponding egg dormancy patterns and thermal responses of egg development. Our results show that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was explained by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation. We suggest that latitudinal patterns in thermal responses and corresponding life histories need to consider the evolution of thermal response curves within the context of seasonal temperature cycles rather than based solely on optimality and trade-offs in performance.This article is part of the theme issue 'Physiological diversity, biodiversity patterns and global climate change: testing key hypotheses involving temperature and oxygen'.									11	0	0	0	8	0	11			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000473329200005	31203762

Herein, we report a facile solvothermal approach to fabricate P-doped triangular PtPdCu nanodarts (PtPdCu-P NDs) using trioctylphosphine as phosphorus dopant. The PtPdCu-P NDs with separated branches can provide high surface areas and sufficient active sites for HER. Moreover, the incorporation of phosphorus into alloys can tailor the electronic structure and the d-band electron density of metals, which is beneficial for adsorption of hydrogen intermediates. Additionally, the phosphorus doping can effectively inhibit the metal dissolution during the electrolysis. Therefore, the PtPdCu-P NDs achieve a very low overpotential of 12 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2), rapid kinetics (Tafel slope: 29 mV dec(-1)) in 0.5 M H2SO4, superior to the undoped PtPdCu NDs. Moreover, the PtPdCu-P NDs also exhibit excellent stability, without obvious structure change and activity degradation after 10,000 cycles and 50-h electrolysis. This P-doping strategy is a universal approach to incorporate phosphorus into various nanomaterials without the change of the overall morphology, which holds a high potential in the water electrolysis.									28	0	0	0	3	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000572062200006		
J	Li, An-Jie; Li, Xiao-Yan				Li, Xiao-yan/C-1808-2009				Selective sludge discharge as the determining factor in SBR aerobic granulation: Numerical modelling and experimental verification								WATER RESEARCH				43	14			3387	3396		10.1016/j.watres.2009.05.004				AUG 2009	2009	Numerical simulation and laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the determining factor and the underlying mechanism in aerobic sludge granulation in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). in the numerical simulation, a sectional approach was used to develop a model to describe the biomass dynamics during the granulation process. The growth of different classes of the SBR sludge with different substrate uptake rates and different sludge discharge ratios was simulated. The results indicate that the selective discharge of slow-settling sludge flocs is the key deter-mining factor for granulation. in the laboratory study, experiments were conducted with two identical 2.4-L, SBRs, R1 and R2, using different sludge discharge methods - the selective discharge of slow-settling sludge flocs for R1, and mixed, unselective sludge discharge for R2. The SBRs were fed with glucose-based synthetic wastewater at a chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading rate of 1.5 kg/m(3)-d. The evolution of the microbial community during the experimental process was monitored using the molecular techniques of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and clone library analysis. Sludge granulation was achieved in less than three weeks in R1, whereas the sludge in R2 remained in the form of flocs. However, some bacterial species had a significant presence in both the R1 granules and the R2 flocs. The results suggest that aerobic granulation may not require the dominance of any particular species. Small and loose sludge flocs were found to have an advantage over larger and dense granules in substrate uptake. Thus, discharge of loose flocs would remove these competitors from the system and makes the substrate more available for uptake and utilisation by biomass in the attached-growth form, resulting in sludge granulation.

These extraordinary features arise from their surface functionalization, their high electrical conductivity, their outstanding dispersion in a variety of solvents, and the presence of several functional groups on their surfaces. However, the presence of van der Waals interactions results in the stacking of the 2D nanosheets of MXenes, like other 2D nanomaterials. This stacking results in a reduction in the number of active sites and poor ionic kinetics, which in turn reduces the activity of the material and hence the performances of MXene-based devices. Therefore, the conversion of 2D MXenes into three-dimensional (3D) MXene architecture has been shown to be an effective technique for reducing restacking, resulting in higher porosity, increased specific surface areas, and shorter mass and ion transportation distances in comparison to 1D and 2D architectures. Herein, we have attempted to summarize commonly used methodologies, such as assembly, templating, 3D printing, electrospinning, and gas foaming, for the construction of 3D MXenes and MXene-based moieties for their potential application as electrocatalytic materials. Further, the structure-property correlation of 3D MXene architectures are also given special consideration. Finally, related challenges and probable future prospects of 3D MXenes have also been discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000814274400001

The chemical changes effected by acid treatment at low HTT are: by 50 degrees C there is significant alteration of the lignin structure; by 100 degrees C a significant portion of the cellulose has reacted, with the formation of ketones and esters; the formation of phosphate esters becomes apparent around 150 degrees C; crosslinking reactions are initiated below 150 degrees C, consistent with the higher carbon yield obtained in chemical activation; and generally there is an increase in aromaticity and loss of aliphatic, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups. The low temperature phenomena precede, and relate to, the development of porosity and structural dilation that commences around 250 degrees C, and attains a maximum between 350 and 450 degrees C. Up to 450 degrees C, pore volume is found to correlate with crosslink density. Above 450 degrees C, there is a dimensional contraction and a reduction in porosity. Among the accompanying phenomena are: the elimination of cellulose phosphates and oxygen functionalities; and a dramatic increase in the estimated aromatic cluster size. The latter would require a reduction in crosslink density to facilitate cluster growth, and the resulting structural rearrangement and increased alignment of clusters would produce a more densely packed structure with reduced porosity.									243	24	0	0	41	0	269			0008-6223			WOS:A1995RV81600007

The passivating efficiency of SO(2) in a SF(6)/SO(2) inductively coupled plasma is assessed comparatively with the traditional SF(6)/O(2) chemistry by means of mass spectrometry and optical emission spectroscopy diagnostics. Emphasis is placed on the evolution of the density of various neutral species (e.g. SiF(4), F, O, SO(x)F(y), SF(x)). These measurements allow us to determine the SO(2)/SF(6) and O(2)/SF(6) gas flow ratios above which a passivation layer forms and inhibits silicon etching. Furthermore, different reaction schemes are proposed to explain the variations in relative densities measured for the two plasma chemistries. In SF(6)/SO(2) plasmas, surface reactions involving SOF and SO(2) species with F radicals are favoured, providing a greater number of SOF(2) and SO(2)F(2) molecules in the gas phase. In SF(6)/O(2) plasmas, a higher rate of O radicals available for reacting with SF x species can account for the greater concentration in SOF(4) molecules. However, these trends are significant for high passivating gas concentrations only. This is consistent with the similar etch results obtained for both chemistries when etching silicon at cryogenic temperatures with a low percentage of passivating gas.									12	0	0	0	0	1	12			0963-0252			WOS:000260891600008

The properties of untreated control were compared with those of samples where the oxygen evolution rate under illumination with continuous saturating light was inhibited by up to 95%. The following results were obtained: a) the detectable initial amplitude (at a time resolution of 30 mus) of the 325 nm absorption changes, DeltaA(3)25, remained virtually invariant whereas the relaxation kinetics exhibit significant changes, b) the 300 mus kinetics of DeltaA(3)25 dominating the relaxation in UV-B treated samples was largely replaced by a 1.3 ms kinetics after addition of MnCl2, c) the extent of the flash induced rise of the relative fluorescence quantum yield was severely diminished in UV-B treated PS II membrane fragments but the relaxation kinetics remain virtually unaffected. Based on these results the water oxidizing complex (WOC) is inferred to be the primary target of UV-B impairment of PS II while the formation of the 'stable' radical pair P680(+.)Q(A)(-.) is almost invariant to this UV-B treatment.									28	1	0	0	24	1	29			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000170974200004	16228328

Herein a nano-sized Mn oxide/agglomerated silsesquioxane composite was used to synthesize an efficient catalyst for water oxidation. The composite was synthesized by a straightforward and simple procedure and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, and electrochemical methods. Silsesquioxane causes good dispersion of Mn in the composite. The water-oxidizing activity of this composite was studied in the presence of cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate. The composite at the best calcination temperature (300 degrees C) shows a turnover frequency 0.3 (mmol O2(/)mol Mn.s). Regarding the low-cost, environmentally friendly precursors, simple synthesis, and efficiency for water oxidation, the composite is a promising catalyst that can be used in artificial photosynthetic systems for water splitting.We used Agglomerated silsesquioxane as a support for nano-sized Mn oxide to synthesize a good water-oxidizing catalyst.[GRAPHICS].									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000385248300006	26846654

NrdD contains catalytic and allosteric sites and, in its active form, a stable glycyl radical. This radical is generated by NrdG with its [4Fe-4S](+) cluster and S-adenosylmethionine. We now find that. NrdD and NrdG from Lactobacillus lactis anaerobically form a tight alpha (2)beta (2) complex, suggesting that radical generation by NrdG and radical transfer to the specific glycine residue of NrdD occurs within the complex. Activated NrdD was separated from NrdG by anaerobic affinity chromatography on dATP-Sepharose without loss of its glycyl radical NrdD alone then catalyzed the reduction of CTP with formate, as the electron donor and ATP as the allosteric effector. The reaction required Mg2+ and was stimulated by K+ but not by dithiothreitol. Thus NrdD is the actual reductase, and NrdG is an activase, making class III reductases highly similar to pyruvate formate lyase and its activase and suggesting a common root for the two anaerobic enzymes during early evolution. Our results further support the contention that ribonucleotide reduction during transition from an RNA world to a DNA world started with a class III-like enzyme from which other reductases evolved when oxygen appeared on earth.									28	0	0	0	22	0	29			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000170910200028	11427536

This work studies the interaction between (La1-xSrx)(n)Co1-yFeyO3-delta (LSCF) cathode and AISI 441 alloy interconnect at 800 degrees C by investigating the interfacial reaction and degradation through an AISI 441 interconnect/LSCF electrode/yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte tri-layer structure. LSCFs with different stoichiometries are created in order to understand cathode composition effect on solid oxide fuel cell performance. The porous microstructures of the electrodes experience significant evolution after the thermal treatment under current load. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses reveal the significance of elemental distributions on the performance of the cathodes. Cr, La, and Co distributions vary with stoichiometry. Ohmic resistance and polarization resistance of the cathodes are analyzed by deconvoluting the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results. Based on the elemental distribution, the microstructure evolution of the LSCF electrodes, and the EIS analysis, the interaction mechanisms between the LSCF electrodes and the AISI 441 alloy are proposed. Overall, the A-site deficient stoichiometry is preferred. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									16	1	0	0	0	0	17			0378-7753			WOS:000321085700018

For >30 years, these reactions have been considered the responsibility of a single enzyme, the 2,3-BPG synthase/2-phosphatase (BPGM). Here, we show that Dictyosteiium, birds, and mammals contain an additional 2,3-BPG phosphatase that, unlike BPGM, removes the 3-phosphate. This discovery reveals that the glycolytic pathway can bypass the formation of 3-phosphoglycerate, which is a precursor for serine biosynthesis and an activator of AMP-activated protein kinase. Our 2,3-BPG phosphatase activity is encoded by the previously identified gene for multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase (MIPP11), which we now show to have dual substrate specificity. By genetically manipulating Mlippl expression in Dictyostelium, we demonstrated that this enzyme provides physiologically relevant regulation of cellular 2,3-BPG content. Mammalian erythrocytes possess the highest content of 2,3-BPG, which controls oxygen binding to hemoglobin. We determined that total MIPP11 activity in erythrocytes at 37 degrees C is 0.6 mmol 2,3-BPG hydrolyzed per liter of cells per h, matching previously published estimates of the phosphatase activity of BPGM. MIPP11 is active at 4 degrees C, revealing a clinically significant contribution to 2,3-BPG loss during the storage of erythrocytes for transfusion. Hydrolysis of 2,3-BPG by human MIPP11 is sensitive to physiologic alkalosis; activity decreases 50% when pH rises from 7.0 to 7.4. This phenomenon provides a homeostatic mechanism for elevating 2,3-BPG levels, thereby enhancing oxygen release to tissues. our data indicate greater biological significance of the Rapoport-Luebering shunt than previously considered.									33	1	1	0	28	0	39			0027-8424			WOS:000255356000011	18413611	
J	Jeung, Yongjae; Roh, Hyogyun; Yong, Kijung								Co-anion exchange prepared 2D structure Ni(Co,Fe)PS for efficient overall water electrolysis								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				576						151720	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151720		NOV 2021		FEB 1 2022	2022	Two-dimensional (2D) Ni alloy catalysts have attracted significant attention for alkaline overall water electrolysis owing to their facile oxidation state changes and long-term stability. However, their low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances owing to their non-optimized hydrogen, water, and hydroxide ion adsorption energies, compared to those of noble metal catalysts, have limited their further application. To address these issues, in this study, we synthesized a 2D-structured Ni(Co,Fe) PS using a co-ion (P and S) exchange method. The synthesized 2D-structured Ni(Co,Fe)PS utilized the averaging effect of the combination of sulfide, which exhibits high hydrogen and water adsorption energies, and phosphide, which exhibits a relatively low hydrogen and water adsorption energy. During a HER process, the synthesized NiCoPS exhibited a lower overpotential (61 mV) compared to NiCoP (75 mV) and NiCoS (66 mV) for the generation of a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope value of 44.5 mV.dec(-1). In addition, the charge transfer resistance of the NiCoPS catalyst (5 Omega) was significantly lower than those of NiCoP (12.1 Omega) and NiCoS (14.3 Omega). As an alkaline OER catalyst, NiFePS exhibited a lower overpotential (242 mV) for the generation of a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) compared to NiFeP (250 mV) and NiFeS (260 mV), and a remarkably low Tafel slope value of 38.0 mV.dec(-1). The charge transfer resistance of NiFePS (1.5 Omega) was significantly lower than those of NiFeP (4.2 Omega) and NiFeS (4.9 Omega). An overall water splitting (OWS) catalyst system was fabricated by combining the NiCoPS and NiFePS catalysts, and OWS system required an overpotential of only 1.54 V for the generation of a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), which is significantly lower than those required by previously reported transition metal-based phosphide catalysts. This study presents a new method to develop highly efficient HER and OER catalysts via a simple co-ion exchange of 2D-structured Ni-alloy layered double hydroxides.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000729816000003

Application to electro-organic synthesis and wastewater treatment								ANNALI DI CHIMICA				92	10			995	1006						OCT 2002	2002	The electrochemical behaviour of a synthetic boron-doped diamond thin film electrode (BDD) has been studied in acid media containing phenol using cyclic voltammetry and bulk electrolysis. The results have shown that in the potential region of water stability direct electron transfers can occur on BDD surface resulting in electrode fouling due to the formation of a polymeric film on its surface. During electrolysis in the potential region of oxygen evolution, complex oxidation reactions can take place due to electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals. Electrode fouling is inhibited under these conditions. Depending on the experimental conditions, the electrogenerated hydroxyl radicals can lead to the combustion of phenol or to the selective oxidation of phenol to benzoquinone. The experimental results have also been compared to a theoretical model that permits the prediction of the evolution with time of phenol concentration, during its combustion, or during its selective oxidation to benzoquinone.

The kinetics of phase evolution, their structure and average microstructure properties were quantitatively investigated by X-ray powder diffraction with the Rietveld method. The results show that the ball milling technique is able to produce Pt-Co solid solutions soon after few minutes of mechanical treatment. Of the two polymorphs of cobalt the fcc allotrope appears to be involved preferentially in the early stage of alloying reaction with fcc: platinum. For the three compositions, a sigmoidal equation based on an interdiffusion-controlled mechanism satisfactorily accounts for the evolution of the solid solution as a function of mechanical treatment time. A characteristic reaction time of 3-6 h is observed for the solid state transformation reaction with the milling conditions adopted in our reactor. In the case of the Pt25Co75 composition, a competitive-consecutive reaction is observed. Lattice parameters of the solid solutions after extended times of milling and related atomic volumes turn out to be slightly above the values ideally predicted on the basis of the Vegard's law. For the Pt75Co25 composition the average crystallite size is reduced down to ca. 150 angstrom after 12 h when the lattice microstrain is also at a maximum, but further mechanical treatment increases the average crystal size value and to decrease the strain. Similar results are found for equiatomic and Co-rich compositions. Annealing of the alloyed equiatomic powders promotes a cubic-to-tetragonal transformation which is already operative at 600 degrees C. In fact, after this treatment two tetragonal phases are observed. Further thermal treatment and annealing at 700 degrees C induces peak sharpening of the diffraction patterns, due to ordering phenomena still in progress. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The light-driven catalytic cycle consists of four observable intermediates (S-0, S-1, S-2, and S-3) and one transient S-4 state. Recently, using X-ray free-electron laser crystallography, two experimental groups independently observed incorporation of one additional oxygen into the cluster during the S-2 to S-3 transition, which is likely to represent a substrate. The present study implicates two competing reaction routes encountered during the structural rearrangement of the catalyst induced by the water binding and immediately preceding the formation of final stable forms in the S-3 state. This mutually exclusive competition involves concerted versus stepwise conformational changes between two isomers, called open and closed cubane structures, which have different consequences on the immediate product in the S-3 state. The concerted pathway involves a one-step conversion between two isomeric hydroxo forms without changes to the metal oxidation and total spin (S-total = 3) states. Alternatively, in the stepwise process, the bound waters are oxidized and transformed into an oxyl-oxo form in a higher spin (S-total = 6) state. Here, density functional calculations are used to characterize all relevant intermediates and transition structures and demonstrate that the stepwise pathway to the substrate activation is substantially favored over the concerted one, as evidenced by comparison of the activation barriers (11.1 and 20.9 kcal mol(-1), respectively). Only after formation of the oxyl-oxo precursor can the hydroxo species be generated; this occurs with a slow kinetics and an activation barrier of 17.8 kcal mol(-1). The overall thermodynamic driving force is likely to be controlled by the movements of two glutamate ligands, D1-Glu189 and CP43-Glu354, in the active site and ranges from very weak (+0.4 kcal mol(-1)) to very strong (-23.5 kcal mol(-1)).									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1010-6030			WOS:000596165600009

In this work, we achieved OWS by developing a plasmon-based solid Z-scheme photocatalytic system. Firstly, visible-light responsive plasmonic photocatalysts (Au/TiO2) was demonstrated as a stable and efficient photocatalyst for water oxidation half reaction. When Au/TiO2 was combined with a H-2-evolution photocatalyst, i.e. Rh doped SrTiO3 (SrTiO3:Rh), hydrogen and oxygen evolution in a stoichiometric ratio (2:1) were achieved under visible light irradiation without using any redox mediator. In addition, the charge separation process in the plasmonic Z-scheme system is studied through employing photoassisted Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) technology and we demonstrated that the plasmon-induced hot electrons can be transferred to SrTiO3:Rh through a solid interface. At last, the mechanism of plasmon induced solid Z-scheme system was proposed, in which Au nanoparticles play both as visible light absorber and electron conductor.

The sulfurization and oxidation of MOFs has proven to be a feasible technique for producing highly active catalytic materials. Here, the MOFs are completely converted to hydroxide by treatment with alkaline solutions only. Electron microscopy demonstrates that hydroxides generated from various MOFs retain the complete profile of the precursor and contain a two-dimensional lamellar or mesoporous structure. FeMIL-88(A)-OH, a two-dimensional structural transformation product generated from Fe-MIL-88(A), demonstrates significant OER performance increase. At the same 300 mV overpotential, Fe-MIL-88(A)-OH delivers 83 times the current density of Fe-MIL-88(A) and 16 times that of commercial IrO2 (22.56 mA cm(-2) vs. 0.27 mA cm(-2) vs. 1.37 mA cm(-2)). The alkali treatment strategy proved to be a generally applicable treatment for MOFs, allowing the conversion of nickel- and cobalt-based MOFs to hydroxide with a significant boost in OER performance.

The XPS spectra of the surfaces after treatment at selected electrode potentials for the O-2 reduction and reoxidation of the surface show the presence of C and S from solvent decomposition and of F and P from electrolyte decomposition. Furthermore, Li is and O is peaks due to Li2O2 and decomposition products such as carbonate, organics, LiF, high oxidation sulfur, and phosphorus compounds were also observed. Using ACN instead of DMSO results in less solvent decomposition, whereas using LiBF4 results in less electrolyte decomposition. XPS, AFM, and EQCM show that O-2 reduction products removal only takes place at very high overpotentials. In agreement with XPS which shows removal of carbonate surface species, DEMS confirms evolution of CO2 and consumption of O-2 at 4.5 V, but LiF cannot be removed completely in a round trip of the Li-O-2 battery cathode.									34	1	0	0	1	0	34			0743-7463			WOS:000360324000031	26222833

However, the efficient, low-cost, and large-scale operable system is still missing. Photocatalytic water splitting has multiple processes that involve light absorption, charge excitation and transfer, mass transfer, and chemical reaction, making it extremely complicated and challenging. Herein, we review the whole-process photocatalytic water splitting from two kinds of "flow": energy flow and mass flow. The energy flow represents transmission and conversion of solar energy through the concentrator, reactor, reaction solution, and photocatalyst. The mass flow refers to transfer of reactants and products in the gas-liquid-solid multiphase environment. For the first time, we clearly describe the energy flow and mass flow in photocatalytic water splitting from multiple spatiotemporal scales, and point out that the low efficiencies of photocatalytic water splitting are attributed to obstacles in energy flow and mass flow, as well as non-coupling and mismatching of energy flow and mass flow. The mechanistic insights learned from this perspective indicate that, in addition to the material optimization, the scientific and engineered design of sunlight collection, interfacial reaction, and mass transfer is of great significance.

The reduction of hydroxypyruvate to glycerate catalyzed by hydroxypyruvate reductase (HPR) in the peroxisomes is thought to be facilitated by the production of NADH by peroxisomal malate dehydrogenase (PMDH). PMDH, which is encoded by two genes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), reduces NAD(+) to NADH via the oxidation of malate supplied from the cytoplasm to oxaloacetate. A double mutant lacking the expression of both PMDH genes was viable in air and had rates of photosynthesis only slightly lower than in the wild type. This is in contrast to other photorespiratory mutants, which have severely reduced rates of photosynthesis and require high CO2 to grow. The pmdh mutant had a higher O-2-dependent CO2 compensation point than the wild type, implying that either Rubisco specificity had changed or that the rate of CO2 released per Rubisco oxygenation was increased in the pmdh plants. Rates of gross O-2 evolution and uptake were similar in the pmdh and wild-type plants, indicating that chloroplast linear electron transport and photorespiratory O-2 uptake were similar between genotypes. The CO2 postillumination burst and the rate of CO2 released during photorespiration were both greater in the pmdh mutant compared with the wild type, suggesting that the ratio of photorespiratory CO2 release to Rubisco oxygenation was altered in the pmdh mutant. Without PMDH in the peroxisome, the CO2 released per Rubisco oxygenation reaction can be increased by over 50%. In summary, PMDH is essential for maintaining optimal rates of photorespiration in air; however, in its absence, significant rates of photorespiration are still possible, indicating that there are additional mechanisms for supplying reductant to the peroxisomal HPR reaction or that the HPR reaction is altogether circumvented.									82	6	0	0	80	0	87			0032-0889			WOS:000259810400010	18685043

Most of the transition metal-based catalysts employed for the water splitting have been fabricated on the solid-electrode support by using binder, which decreases the activity and durability of the catalyst system. In this respect, self-supported metal organic framework (MOF) derived catalysts have been introduced with enhanced catalytic activity and mechanical stability for the electrochemical water splitting. The self-supported MOF derived catalysts exhibit improved electronic conductivity, high electrochemical surface area, enhanced mechanical stability and strong catalyst-support interaction. Moreover, these catalysts possess highly porous and hollow structure with designed morphology and multi-metallic composition. Recently, a tremendous effort has been provided to explore this newly growing field and new dimensions and directions have been achieved. Looking at this point, we have described here the basic principles of catalyst design from self-supported MOF, structural and interface engineering by controlling the electronic structure of the catalysts to improve the water splitting activity. In addition, the challenges and difficulties associated with this field have been pointed out and addressed for the future progress in this field.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000514744900001	32017410

At a high injection rate (e.g., 45 mL min(-1)), PdAu core-shell nanoplates on rGO are generated by strong galvanic replacement between PdSPs and the Au precursor, followed by reduction of the Pd precursor. In contrast, PdAu nanoplates with a core-shell and alloy integrating structure are obtained on rGO by co-reduction of the Au and Pd precursors by AA due to the inhibition of the abovementioned galvanic replacement at a slow injection rate (e.g., 0.5 mL min(-1)). The PdAu nanoplates with a core-shell and alloy integrating structure on rGO exhibit a substantially enhanced catalytic activity towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) relative to the PdAu core-shell nanoplates and PdSPs on rGO, and is comparable to the commercial Pt/C. Significantly, these core-shell and alloy integrating nanoplates on rGO have much superior durability over Pt/C for catalyzing the HER under acidic conditions. The remarkable enhancement in activity and durability can be attributed to the cooperative function of the PdAu alloy and electron coupling between nanoplates and graphene.									7	1	0	0	1	0	8			2046-2069			WOS:000410306700005

The evolution of C and O abundances in the Milky Way can impose strong constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis and help in understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy.Aims. The aim of this paper is to review the measured C and O abundances in the disk and bulge of the Galaxy and compare the results to predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models.Methods. We adopt two successful chemical evolution models for the bulge and the disk, respectively. They assume the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions but different histories of star formation.Results. The data show a clear distinction between the trend of [C/O] in the thick and thin Galactic disks, while the thick disk and bulge trends are indistinguishable with a large (>0.5 dex) increase in the [C/O] ratio in the range from -0.1 to +0.4 dex for [O/H]. In our models we consider yields from massive stars with and without the inclusion of metallicity-dependent stellar winds. The observed increase in the [C/O] with metallicity in the bulge and thick disk lies between the predictions utilizing mass-loss rates of Maeder and Meynet & Maeder. A model without metallicity-dependent yields completely fails to match the observations. Thus, the relative increase in carbon abundance at high metallicity appears to come from metallicity-dependent stellar winds in massive stars. These results also explain the steep decline of the [O/Fe] ratio with [Fe/H] in the Galactic bulge, while the [Mg/Fe] ratio is enhanced at all [Fe/H].Conclusions. We conclude that data and models are consistent with a rapid bulge and thick disk formation timescales, and with metallicity-dependent yields for C and O. The observed too high [C/O] ratios at low metallicity in the bulge may stem from an unaccounted source of carbon: very fast rotating metal poor stars, or metal-poor binary systems whose envelopes were stripped by Roche lobe overflow.									60	0	0	0	1	1	60			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000270638600016

The elucidation of the binding mechanisms and orientation and the arising supramolecular photoelectron transfer properties of ruthenium sensitizers adsorbed on metal colloids can be regarded as tools for the generation of highly efficient systems for artificial photosynthesis. We describe in this paper a simple and application-oriented method for the evaluation ofthe catalyst's effective surface in water solution and characteristic differences in the binding and interaction modes of [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) to the four colloidal catalysts and the bis-heteroleptic sensor complexes listed above with the ruthenium colloid. In consequence, supramolecular systems for directed photoelectron transfer toward metal colloids in artificial model systems for photosynthesis can be designed in a simple and efficient manner.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0743-7463			WOS:A1994PY60400017

Its inertness hinders hBN from functionalization for energy conversion applications. A question arising is whether it is possible to make hBN chemically reactive. Here, we report cryomilling in liquid N-2, as an effective strategy to activate the chemical reactivity of hBN by engineering different vacancies to produce defective-BN (d-BN). The local reactivity of the vacancies is probed by photoluminescence (PL) emissions and electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of different vacancies with/without oxygen cause the creation of mid-gap states that are responsible for the PL emissions in the visible region. These vacancies also generate localized free radicals which are both theoretically and experimentally confirmed by spin density calculations and ESR. Due to the vacancy induced free radicals and Fermi level shifts, d-BN can be controllably functionalized with single metal atoms by the spontaneous reduction of metal cations; mono-metallic or bi-metallic clusters can also be effectively reduced. As a proof of concept, the surface-bound metal nanostructures, especially substrate confined single metal atoms, exhibit improved hydrogen evolution catalytic performance, and can be further used for sensing, and quantum information.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000744194000012

The resulting Mo2C@N-DC/G aerogel films exhibited homogeneous interconnected open-cell architectures, and the Mo2C nanoparticles were homogeneously embedded within a chitin/graphene oxide aerogel derived 3D highly conductive N-DC/G nanonetwork. Benefitting from the unique three-dimensional honeycomb-like architecture and characteristics with excellent electron transportation, abundant active sites, strong interaction between Mo2C nanocrystals and N-DC/G frameworks, the as-prepared catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic activity and endurance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized Mo2C@N-DC/G electrocatalyst exhibits excellent HER electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 107 mV to achieve a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 65.8 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. Moreover, it also displays outstanding long-term electrochemical stability, exhibiting no significant decay after 1500 cycles and 15 h of continuous testing at fixed overpotentials. This work will illuminate an entirely new avenue for exploring various low-cost, high-performance self-supported electrode materials for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.									13	1	0	0	2	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000509327200054

We have performed density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the effects of a third transition metal (M) addition into the Ni3Mo alloy on the surface segregation and the stability of bulk terminated and Ni-segregated Ni3Mo/M(111) surfaces. The third transition metals (M=Tc, Ru, W, Re, or Os) are found to enhance the Ni surface segregation, while M=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Nb, Rh, Hf, Ta, or Ir retain the Ni-segregated surface but weaken the Ni surface segregation tendency. The remaining transition metals (M=Sc, Zn, Y, Zr, Pd, Ag, Cd, Pt, or Au) show a complete suppression of the Ni surface segregation. We find the transition metals (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Hf, and W) can stabilize a special atomic configuration that is predicted to have an outstanding catalytic performance for water electrolysis. Furthermore, we analyze the factors that control the Ni surface segregation behavior in the Ni3Mo/M(111) surface. The present study provides useful theoretical guide for developing highly active Ni-Mo-M hydrogen evolution electrodes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0966-9795	1879-0216		WOS:000425579200014

The morphology and the exposed active site content of Zn1-xCdxS/CdS could be facilely modulated by varying the particle size of ZnS precursors, and the heterostructure with the smallest particle size showed the highest photocatalytic activity of 22.99 mmol h(-1) g(-1) in Na2S + Na2SO3 solution. Furthermore, the in situ embedding of the ZnO cocatalyst on the Zn1-xCdxS/CdS heterostructure dramatically improved its photocatalytic activity to 84.17 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 765 times higher than that of CdS prepared by a hydrothermal method. More significantly, the ZnO-embedded Zn1-xCdxS/CdS heterostructure gave a considerable H-2 production rate even in the absence of hole scavengers, whereas the bare Zn1-xCdxS/CdS exhibited no hydrogen evolution, and it showed very competitive photocatalytic activity in methanol in comparison with that in Na2S + Na2SO3 solution under similar alkaline circumstances. These investigations indicate that the existence of the ZnO cocatalyst in the heterostructure could not only effectively improve the photocatalytic activity by suppressing the recombination of charge carriers and acting as a photocatalytic reaction site, but also make it possible to adopt methanol as the sacrificial reagent for sulfide photocatalysts.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			1466-8033			WOS:000371233200020

Over the years, nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) have been identified as important gaseous signaling molecules involved in modulating the redox homeostasis in the developing lung. While animal data targeting aspects of these redox pathways have been promising in treating and/or preventing experimental models of neonatal lung disease, none are particularly effective in human neonatal clinical trials. In recent years, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has emerged as a novel gasotransmitter involved in a magnitude of cellular signaling pathways and functions. The importance of H2S signaling may lie in the fact that early life-forms evolved in a nearly anoxic, sulfur-rich environment and were dependent on H2S for energy. Recent studies have demonstrated an important role of H2S and its synthesizing enzymes in lung development, which normally takes place in a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment. In this review, we look at clues from evolution and explore the important role that the H2S signaling pathway may play in oxidative neonatal respiratory diseases and discuss future opportunities to explore this phenomenon in the context of neonatal chronic lung disease.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2227-9067		WOS:000633475300001	33799529

However, the shortcomings such as limited active sites and the inherently low electroconductivity of the 2H-phase MoS2 restrain its application. Tuning of the phase composition (from 2H to 1T phase) and the microstructure of MoS2 have been proposed as effective strategies to improve the catalytic activity of MoS2. However, complicated chemical exfoliation and morphology regulation are generally involved in these process. Herein, we developed a facile hydrothermal method to in situ synthesize hierarchical MoS2 nanorods with mixed 1T and 2H phases. The coexisting 1T phase can provide more active sites and improve the electronic conductivity of the nanorods. In addition, the Schottky barriers formed at the boundaries of the 1T and 2H phases can improve the conductivity. Moreover, the hierarchical structure can improve the contact area between the MoS2 catalyst and the electrolyte, and the rod-like one-dimensional structure of the catalyst favors fast charge transfer and ion diffusion. Due to these unique properties, the as-synthesized MoS2 nanocatalyst exhibits excellent HER performance with a small overpotential of 156 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 47.9 mV per decade, and robust stability. This study provides a guideline for the design of an electrocatalyst with high HER performance in multiscale principles.									23	0	0	0	0	0	23			1466-8033			WOS:000462635300016

To avoid energy losses in the production process, the use of highly acidic (Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer) and alkaline (alkaline water electrolyzer) electrolytes is conventional practice in this field. Unfortunately, there are several other issues associated with the use of acidic and alkaline electrolytes such as the requirement of specific ion exchanging membranes with good stability, acid or alkali stable catalysts and corrosive environment withstanding cell stacks, etc. To overcome these issues, researchers have shown interest in the field of electrochemical water splitting in neutral and near-neutral conditions. In this review, the chronological development of 3d transition-metal-based electrocatalysts for neutral and near-neutral water splitting is extensively discussed with emphases on screening methodologies, mechanisms, structure-activity correlations, and detailed catalyst specific evolution. In addition, catalysts reported so far, are also benchmarked based on their performance separately for different electrolytes used.									129	6	0	0	2	0	129			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000505981300003		
J	Song, Xueyan; Lee, Shiwoo; Chen, Yun; Gerdes, Kirk								Electrochemically influenced cation inter-diffusion and Co3O4 formation on La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 infiltrated into SOFC cathodes								SOLID STATE IONICS				278				91	97		10.1016/j.ssi.2015.05.026				OCT 1 2015	2015	Nanosized LSC electrocatalyst was infiltrated into a porous scaffold cathode composed of Sm2O3-doped CeO2 (SDC) and La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-delta (LSCF) in a commercial button solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). To understand the stability of cathodes infiltrated with LSC, the infiltrated composite cells were subjected to both electrochemical operating and thermal aging states at 750 degrees C for 1500 h. Nanostructure and local chemistry evolution of La0.6Sr0.4CoO3 (LSC) infiltrated cathodes upon operation and aging were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. After operation, the LSC remained a cubic perovskite, and the crystal grains exhibit comparable size to as-infiltrated LSC grains. Inter-diffusion of Fe from the LSCF to a Fe-incorporated LSC layer developed on the LSCF backbone. However, only sharp interfaces were observed between LSC and SDC backbone in the as-infiltrated cathode and such interfaces remain after operation. The infiltrated LSC on the SDC backbone also retains granular particle morphology. Furthermore, newly grown CO3O4 nanociystals were found in the operated cathode. After thermal aging, on the other hand, cation inter-diffusion across the interfaces of the infiltrate particles and the cathode backbones is less than that from the operated cells. The following hypothesis is proposed: CO3O4 forms on LSC arising from local charge balancing between cobalt and oxygen vacancies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, a composite photoanode, consisting of nanopyramidal BiVO4 arrays and one layered double hydroxide (NiMn-LDH) was designed and fabricated via a facile route. The obtained BiVO4/NiMn-LDH composite photoelectrode presented a significant enhancement in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) current density, conversion efficiency and stability for solar water oxidation. With 2D NiMn-LDH decoration, an obvious cathodic shift of similar to 480 mV in the onset potential can be observed, and more than two times enhancement in photocurrent performance is achieved. The improvement in photoelectrochemical activity for BiVO4/NiMn-LDH composite photoanode can be attributed to the enhanced water-oxidation kinetics leading to the efficient separation, transfer and collection of charge carriers at the photoanode/electrolyte interface. The result demonstrates NiMn-LDH represents one of the active oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) to improve the PEC activity of metal oxide photoanode.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000515117000007	31747640

Among various electrolysis technologies, the emerging anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) shows the most potential for producing green hydrogen at a competitive price. In this review, we demonstrate a comprehensive introduction to AEMWE including the advanced electrode design, the lab-scaled testing system establishment, and the electrochemical performance evaluation. Specifically, recent progress in developing high activity transition metal-based powder electrocatalysts and self-supporting electrodes for AEMWE is summarized. To improve the synergistic transfer behaviors between electron, charge, water, and gas inside the gas diffusion electrode (GDE), two optimizing strategies are concluded by regulating the pore structure and interfacial chemistry. Moreover, we provide a detailed guideline for establishing the AEMWE testing system and selecting the electrolyzer components. The influences of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technologies and operation conditions on cell performance are also discussed. Besides, diverse electrochemical methods to evaluate the activity and stability, implement the failure analyses, and realize the in-situ characterizations are elaborated. In end, some perspectives about the optimization of interfacial environment and cost assessments have been proposed for the development of advanced and durable AEMWE.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2589-7780			WOS:000841406800001

Hollow ZIF-67/ZIF-8 (core/shell) frameworks have been synthesized using solvothermal synthesis in methanol, wherein preformed ZIF-67 nanocrystals have been used as core. Using this method, hollow core/shell frameworks have been synthesized by excavation of ZIF-67 core and concurrent deposition of ZIF-8 shell for varying time. The crystal structure and chemical bonding of the frameworks have been characterized using X-ray diffraction, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy. Morphology of the hollow frameworks has been investigated using FE-SEM and EDX. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy in combination with small angle X-ray scattering have been used to characterize the multiscale pore architecture (ultramicropores to mesopores) of these hollow frameworks. The sodalite topology and associated pore architecture of ZIFs are retained during the synthesis of hollow framework, however the excavation of core leads to enhancement in mesopores. Hollow frameworks have been tested for their performance towards oxygen evolution reaction. The hollow frameworks show improvement in the catalytic activity as compared to pure ZIF-67 nanocrystals. It is proposed that in order to further improve their catalytic performance, post-synthesis modifications for enhancement in stability of pore network of shell and loading of active species are required.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1387-1811	1873-3093		WOS:000783869700005

However, large-scale production of H2O2 is manufactured through nongreen methods that motivate people to develop more efficient and green technologies as alternatives. As a novel and green technology used for H2O2 generation, the efficiency of photocatalysis is still far from satisfactory. Here, we demonstrate a novel and efficient path of the generation of H2O2 in BiOCl photocatalysis but not the direct electron reduction of O-2 or hole oxidation of OH- to H2O2. Super high production (685 mu mol/h) of H2O2 by the addition of HCOOH as the hole shuttle was realized over BiOCl nanoplates. In this photocatalytic system, the BiOCl supplied abundant photoinduced holes to initiate HCOO center dot radical. The HCOO center dot further reacts with OH- to center dot OH which is proven to be the source of the H2O2. Apart from HCOOH, O-2 also played important roles. The O-2 not only promoted the reaction through the cycle between Bi3+ and Bi, which decreased the combination of carriers, but also avoided the carbonation of surfaces, thus achieving the high production of H2O2 (1020 mu mol/h). In this work, we shed light on a deep understanding of the photocatalytic evolution of H2O2 in a novel perspective and achieve high production.									36	3	0	0	2	0	37			2168-0485			WOS:000444924500070

Raney nickel/Mo coatings are used for cathodic hydrogen evolution and matrix composite anodes consisting of Raney nickel and oxide electrocatalyst for the anodic oxygen evolution reaction. For the spraying of the thermally sensitive oxide electrocatalyst (e.g. Co3O4) special process conditions involving plasma-chemical effects (reactive plasma spraying) had to be developed.The electrochemical behavior of VPS electrodes has been investigated in half cells in 25 wt% KOH solution at 70 degrees C in the current density range of 0.05 - 1.0 A/cm(2). Cathodic overvoltage determined by IR-free polarisation curves was in the range of 100 mV at 1 A/cm(2) current density, IR-free anodic overvoltage at 250 mV under identical conditions.In order to test the electrodes for intermittent operation as required for advanced water electrolysis using current from renewable energy sources or off-peak power from the grid, the current supply was simulated by a computer program for these conditions. The IR-free potentials were monitored hourly by an automated data acquisiton system. The electrodes showed stable behavior during intermittent operation for a period of 10 000 hours indicating no evidence of serious degradation.The operation of VPS electrodes in 1 kW test electrolyzers proved a total reduction of the cell voltage by approximately 20% compared to non-activated standard electrodes.					11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)11th World Hydrogen Energy Conference (11 WHEC)	JUN 23-28, 1996JUN 23-28, 1996	Deut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschungDeut Gesell Chem Apparatewesen Chem Tech & Biotechnol e V; Int Assoc Hydrogen Energy; State Govt Baden Wurttemberg; Lord Mayor City Stuttgart; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen; Bayer Motorenwerke AG, Munchen; Bayernwerk AG, Munchen; Daimler Benz AG, Stuttgart; Deut Lufthansa AG, Frankfurt am Main; Hamburg Elekt Werke AG, Hamburg; Hoechst AG, Frankfurt am Main; Huls AG, Marl; Landesgirokasse LG Stift, Stuttgart; Linde AG, Hollriegelskreuth; Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld; PreussenElektra, Hannover; Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart; US DOE; Tech Werke Stadt Stuttgart AG; Deut Forschungsanstalt Luftfahrt & Raumfahrt e V; Deut Phys Gesell, Arbeitskreis Energie; Energietech Gesell VDE; European Federat Chem Engn; Forum Zukunftsenergien e V; VDI, Gesell Energietech; Zentrum SonnenenergieForschung & WasserstoffForschung	STUTTGART, GERMANYSTUTTGART, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0	0						WOS:A1996BG96N00085

Ultrafine nanocomposites were obtained after repeated heat treatment and were marked as initial g-C3N4, g-C3N4/NiO 2.5%, g-C3N4/NiO 5.0%, g-C3N4/NiO 7.5%, and g-C3N4/NiO 10%. The successful attachment of NiO to the surface of g-C3N4 was further confirmed by the results of TEM and SAED. The average sizes of the coherent scattering region, determined by the broadening of the reflex (002), were 11.6, 10.4, 10.4, 9.9 and 9.9 nm for the initial, 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5%, 10% samples, respectively. The obtained powder of graphite-like carbon nitride and the NiO-composites, according to the results of low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, had a mesoporous structure and was characterized by an average pore size of 16.6-20.8 nm and a porosity of 0.40-0.57 cm(3) g(-1). It was found that increasing the amount of nickel oxide in the composite had a positive effect on the electrochemical characteristics of the electrode during electro-catalytic reforming - hydrogen evolution from a water-alcohol solution. The g-C3N4/NiO 7.5% nanocomposite showed the best results. Based on voltammetry, it was found that the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction on graphitic carbon nitride equalled 215 mV (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and the Tafel slope was 95 mV dec(-1). The results of the cyclic voltammetry of the electrode based on exfoliated g-C3N4 indicated its high stability.									14	0	1	0	0	0	14			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000564464800025	32820775

To alleviate this difficulty, we have synthesized MoS2 quantum dots (QDs) having greater quantity of catalytic edge sites by breaking up the bulk MoS2 sheet using the solvent exfoliation technique. The synthesized MoS2 QDs are embedded into polyaniline (PANI)-N,N'-dibenzoyl-L-cystine (DBC) hydrogel matrix by in situ polymerization of aniline where DBC acts as a gelator, dopant, and cross-linker. The hybrid conducting aerogels (DBC-MoS2-PANI) thus produced act as an efficient electrocatalyst showing lower HER overpotential in comparison to MoS2 QDs. It exhibits an optimum overpotential value of 196 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a favorable Tafel slope of 58 mV/dec, and an excellent cyclic stability. Also, DBC-MoS2-PANI aerogel is used in photoresponding devices. The DBC-MoS2-PANI hybrid aerogel exhibits a better photoresponse compared to the DBC-PANI aerogel and MoS2 QDs upon white light illumination of 1 sun. The hybrid aerogel exhibits a maximum enhancement of photocurrent to the value of 3.95 mA at 2 V bias, and the time-dependent photoillumination shows much faster rise and decay of photocurrent compared to those of DBC-PANI aerogel and MoS2 QDs.									23	1	0	0	1	0	24			2574-0970			WOS:000461400600032

Box whisker plots discovered that pure Pt at the cathode surface, Ti at the anode support, the existence of Pt, Ir, Co, Ru at the anode surface, Ti porous structures at the electrodes, pure water-electrolyte and Nafion and Aquivion type membranes in proton exchange electrolyzer provide the highest performances. Principal component analysis indicated that when cathode surface consists of mostly pure Ni, when anode electrode has no support or vanadium (10-20%) doped TiO2 support and when anode electrode surface consists of cobalt-iron alloys (0.5:0.5 and 0.333:0.666 mol ratio) or RuO2, there is a risk for low-performance. Classification trees revealed that other than current density and potential, cathode surface Ni mole fraction, anode surface Co mole fraction are the most important variables for the performance of an electrolyzer.

The F- doped Ti/Co3O4 electrodes could be used as photoanode to degrade anthraquinone dye (reactive Brilliant Blue KN-R), and showed excellent photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) activity. It is proposed that the fast ions and electron transportation, high oxygen evolution potential, lower resistance, large active area, and good electrolyte infiltration are responsible for the improved PEC activity of the F- doped Ti/Co3O4 system. Nevertheless, the F- doped Ti/Co3O4 electrode with divergent flower-like structure composed of needle nanowires exhibited highest PEC activity than that of other electrodes. It is noteworthy that the presence of electrostatic anti-barrier arises from an ohmic contact between the metal (Ti) and the semiconductor (Co3O4) is also an important factor for the higher PEC activity of the F- doped Ti/Co3O4 electrodes. The work provides unique insight into the design of Co3O4 photoanode from a perspective of tailoring the ion doping and morphology.									11	1	0	0	2	0	11			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000468598600014

This study aims to analyze the role of calcium-silicon-aluminum (Ca-Si-Al) interactions in char gasification and distinguish the difference of the interaction in different gasifying agent. The gasification reactivity of coal char was closely linked with the physiochemical structure and the mineral interactions. It was found that whether in CO2 or H2O, the calcium oxide (CaO) has function to promote the generation of mesopores, which is beneficial to the diffusion of reactant and product gases. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that no SiO2 particles agglomerated in coal char containing silicon-aluminum ((Si-Al)-coal), which was a good reason why Si-Al inhibited gasification severely; the well dispersed SiO2 particles have no function to adsorb the gasifying agent molecular to transfer oxygen. New minerals including Ca2Al2SiO7, Ca2SiO4 and CaSiO3 were formed in CO2 and H2O, while CaAl2Si2O8 only was detected in H2O. These new minerals exert a positive effect on active site in CO2 but negative effect in H2O. While in H2O, compared with active sites, the mesopores dominate the reaction more. Overall, the interactions catalyze gasification to a moderate degree whether in CO2 or H2O.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000783173000007

Conventional CAWE uses relatively costly metal-based anodes such as Pt, SnO2/Ti, and IrO2-RuO2/Ti. Previous work confirms that metal-free carbon anodes, however, demonstrate excellent performance in biomass-assisted water electrolysis. Inspired by this, this work examines the feasibility and effectiveness of low-cost graphite felt (GF) anodes in CAWE. The results show that GF is a promising candidate for CAWE. Compared to Pt, SnO2/Ti, Pt/Ti, IrO2-RuO2/Ti, and IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti, GF has higher reactivity for the CAWE. The current density is higher than 5 mA cm(-2) when the cell voltage is 1 V for coal electrolysis at Pt parallel to GF. When the current density is 1 mA cm(-2), 5 mA cm(-2), 10 mA cm(-2), and 50 mA cm(-2), the cell voltage of water electrolysis at Pt parallel to IrO2-RuO2/Ti is 1.84 times, 1.64 times, 1.50 times and 1.13 times that of coal electrolysis at Pt parallel to GF, respectively.

Inspired by the morphology of natural plant pods, this paper proposes a new strategy to design a novel pod-like electrocatalyst and use the catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water splitting. This article involves the in situ conversion of 2D Co-metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets grown on the surface of carbon cloth into a pod-like coupling structure of 3D Co-MOF nanocubes and 2D Co-MOF nanosheets. After vulcanization, the precursor can be further transformed into a pod-like transition metal-sulfide composite material, which is composed of 2D N-doped nanosheets and 3D N-doped polyhedrons (2D/3D-CoS2@CC) structure. Experimental results show that this composite material has a large number of available active sites, accelerating charge/mass transfer capability, and the synergistic effect of nanosheets and nanocubes. As a result, in the prepared materials, S-800 shows excellent HER properties. In alkaline medium, the optimized S-800 material only needs 131 mV and 245 mV overpotentials when the current density is 10 mA cm(-2) and 50 mA cm(-2), respectively. This study provides a novel idea for rationally designing active and stable 2D/3D composite structure transition metal catalysts for water splitting.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000759295900001

In compound 1, each three-electron-reduced {AsW12O40} polyanion cluster utilizes all of its surface oxygen atoms to connect 12 K1 and 6 K2 cations at its periphery, which can be viewed as mu(4)- and mu(2)-bridges to further link with four and two adjacent {AsW12} clusters, respectively. The coordination number and modes of {AsW12} and K+ ions together result in a high-symmetrical 2,4,18-connected 3D open skeleton with a new {3(24).4(40).5(4).4(3).5(4).4(2).5(4).4(2).5(4).4.5(32).6(33)}{3(4).4(2)}(3){3}(3) topology. Compound 1 represents the first pure inorganic 3D structure based on the highest connection of Keggin arsenotungstate heteropoly blue and potassium ions. Compound 1 shows efficient photodegradation activity towards MB, MO, RhB, and AP under UV light irradiation. The life of the catalyst, kinetics, and mechanisms of the catalytic reaction have been studied in detail.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000445850600006

In order to identify the evolution of the species formed during the electrooxidation of ethanol infrared spectra have been collected in KOH/H2O and KOD/D2O electrolytes. Whereas the electrochemical studies show different catalytic performance for the EOR (Ethanol Oxidation Reaction) over the three catalysts in terms of onset potential and actual current density, especially at low potentials, the IR spectra show that carbonates and acetates are the main species formed during the EOR with all catalysts. The infrared spectra reveal that the scission of the C-C bond of ethanol takes place at the surface of Pt/C, PtRu/C and Pt3Sn catalysts at potentials as low as 20 mV vs RHE yielding carbonates. At higher potentials, C2 species resulting from the partial oxidation of ethanol to acetates are the main species detected with all catalysts. Upon the progress of the ethanol oxidation, the electrolyte becomes acidified and acetaldehyde and acetic acid (C2 species typically formed during the EOR at acid electrolyte) are observed.

The current major method for ammonia production, however, is the Haber-Bosch process that leads to massive energy consumption and severe environmental issues. Compared with nitrogen (N-2) reduction, electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), with a higher NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency, holds promise for efficient NH3 production under ambient conditions. To achieve efficient NO3RR, electrocatalysts should exhibit high selectivity and Faradaic efficiency with a high NH3 yield rate. In this work, we developed twodimensional (2D) iron-based cyano-coordination polymer nanosheets (Fe-cyano NSs) following in situ electrochemical treatment for high-rate NO3RR. Owing to the strong adsorption of nitrate on Fe-0 active sites generated via topotactic conversion and in situ electroreduction, 2D Fe-cyano electrocatalyst exhibits high catalytic activity with a yield rate of 42.1 mg h- 1 mgcat(-1) and a Faradaic efficiency of over 90% toward NH3 production at -0.5 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). Further electrochemical characterizations revealed that superhydrophilic surface and enhanced electrochemical surface area of the 2D porous nanostructures also contributed to the high-rate NO3RR activity. An electrolyzer toward NO3RR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a two-electrode configuration is constructed based on 2D Fe-cyano, achieving an energy efficiency of 26.2%. This work provides an alternative methodology toward topotactic conversion of transition metal nanosheets for NO3RR and reveals the often-overlooked contribution of hydrophilicity of the catalysts for high-rate electrocatalysis.									14	0	0	0	2	0	14			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000734233700001	34919376

Their inhibitory effect is based on the redox interactions with PS II reaction centre (RC) components and on the formation of a short cyclic electron transfer which leads to the reversible separation of photoinduced charges in PS II. This conclusion is supported by the following effects obtained upon treatment of isolated chloroplasts of higher plants or PS II preparations with K-15 or K-23: (1) inhibition of the photoinduced changes in chlorophyll fluorescence yield (DELTAF) related to photoreduction of primary electron acceptor Q(A) and absorption changes (DELTAA) related to photoaccumulation of the primary electron donor P680 in its oxidized form P680+; (2) acceleration of dark relaxation and the decrease of DELTAA and DELTAF related of photoreduction of the intermediary electron acceptor pheophytin and the decrease of the fluorescence yield following the dark reduction of Q(A) under anaerobic conditions; (3) disappearance of all these effects upon addition of dithionite (which reduces K-15 and K-23 in the dark) accompanied by the accelerated electron donation to RC; (4) coincident concentration dependence of the inhibition by these compounds of both oxygen evolution and the above reactions related to electron transfer in PS II RC (the value of inhibition constant K1 was equal to 45 and 69 nM for K-15 and K-23, respectively).									12	1	0	0	8	0	12			0233-4755			WOS:A1992JR99700001

Poikilothermic vertebrates such as teleost fishes are capable of classical conditioning and have long-term memories, but it remains unknown to what degree such capabilities are associated with affective states. Here, we investigate whether the concept of frustration may apply to Atlantic salmon. In mammals, this paradigm comprises the omission of an expected reward (OER), which elicits behavioural and physiological coping responses (e.g. aggression and stress reactions). Six groups with 200 fish in each were conditioned to associate a flashing light (CS) with feeding. Conditioning over 22 days led to a change from aversion to attraction to the CS. Subsequently, 3 groups served as control, and 3 groups were subjected to an OER paradigm for 9 days, in which the expected food reward was delayed for 30 min during two out of three daily meals. Compared to controls, OER groups displayed higher levels of aggression and more heterogeneous growth rates, indicating a more pronounced social hierarchy. Cortisol levels did, however, not differ between treatments and both groups responded similarly to acute stress. These results indicate that teleost fishes, like mammals, respond aggressively to OER. The capacity to respond behaviourally to frustrating conditions thus likely reflects an adaptive response to environmental unpredictability, which has been conserved throughout vertebrate evolution.									22	0	0	0	17	1	22			1435-9448			WOS:000307766300015	22622814

Among them, the Pd3Fe alloy film electrode possesses the best hydrogen evolution activity, which significantly changes the properties of hydrogen adsorption (H-ad) and absorption (N-abs) of Pd. Pd3Fe is a nanoassembled film, which consists of many tiny nanosheets connected together. The electrochemical surface area of Pd3Fe electrode is 13 and 7 times that of the Pd/C and Pd electrode, respectively. At the same time, Pd and Fe had formed an alloy structure. The (111) plane of the Pd3Fe alloy is an obvious positive shift, and the crystal cell is compressed. The electron is transferred from Fe to Pd through XPS analysis, which has proven the electronic relationship between Pd and Fe. DFT calculations have also shown that the AGH. of the Pd3Fe surface is significantly reduced compared to that of Pd. Reducing the desorption energy of H on the Pd surface is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic performance. It is noteworthy that the HER activity of Pd3Fe electrode has exceeded that of Pd/C, Pd, and Pt/C in both 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH. The HER activity of Pd3Fe electrode is 20, 1.9, and 3.1 times that of Pd/C, Pd, and Pt/C in 1.0 M KOH at -0.2 V. In 0.5 M H2SO4, the HER activity of the Pd3Fe electrode is 6, 3.5, and 1.6 times that of Pd/C, Pd, and Pt/C. The Pd3Fe film electrode has the most favorable reaction kinetics, with Tafel slopes of 44.7 and 38.7 mV dec(-1) in acidic and alkaline solutions, respectively. The values of the Tafel slope indicate that the mechanism of HER on the Pd3Fe film electrode is consistent with the Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway, and the Heyrovsky step is a rate-determining step. In this paper, the Pd alloy electrode has exceeded the commercial Pt/C in both acidic and alkaline solutions, which makes it more practical.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900090

In both cases, autoignition is observed to initiate at locations with low scalar dissipation rates and high HO2 depletion rates. It is found that the induction stage prior to autoignition is primarily dominated by chemical kinetics and diffusion while the improved scalar mixing imparted by the large-scale flow structures controls the ignition progress in later stages. We further investigate the ignition transience and its connection with mixing by varying the initial wake conditions and fuel jet to oxidizer velocity ratios. These studies reveal that the autoignition delay times are independent of initial wake flow conditions. However, with increased jet velocity ratios, the later stages of ignition are accelerated, mainly due to enhanced mixing facilitated by the higher scalar dissipation rates. Furthermore, the sensitivity studies for the jet inwake configuration showa significant reduction in ignition delay even for about 0.14% (by volume) hydrogen dilution in the oxidizer. In addition, the detailed autoignition chemistry and the relative roles of certain radical species in the initiation of the autoignition process in these non-premixed jets are investigated by tracking the evolution of important chain reactions using a Lagrangian particle tracking approach. The reaction H-2 + O-2 <-> HO2 + H is recognized to be the dominant chain initiation reaction that provides H radicals essential for the progress of subsequent elementary reactions during the pre-ignition stage.

We explain a chemical model for gas-phase water, simplified for the limited number of reactions or processes that are active in extreme cold (< 15 K). In this model, water is removed from the gas phase by freezing on to grains and by photodissociation. Water is formed as ice on the surface of dust grains from O and OH and released into the gas phase by photodesorption. The reactions are fast enough with respect to the slow dynamical evolution of L1544 that the gas-phase water is in equilibrium for the local conditions throughout the cloud. We explain the paradoxical radiative transfer of the H2O (1(10)-1(01)) line. Despite discouragingly high optical depth caused by the large Einstein A coefficient, the subcritical excitation in the cold, rarefied H-2 causes the line brightness to scale linearly with column density. Thus, the water line can provide information on the chemical and dynamical processes in the darkest region in the centre of a cold, dense cloud. The inverse P-Cygni profile of the observed water line generally indicates a contracting cloud. This profile is reproduced with a dynamical model of slow contraction from unstable quasi-static hydrodynamic equilibrium (an unstable Bonnor-Ebert sphere).									45	0	0	0	0	0	45			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000334744000054

Many existing resources are being used to fulfil the current requirements. But these existing resources are also causing serious environmental pollution which is a very serious concern of the current era. Therefore, there is an immense need to think and produce environment friendly and sustainable renewable energy resources. Water, being abundant on Earth, is one of the most suitable sources of hydrogen energy. In this work the splitting of water and hydrogen production by different techniques, specially the promising photocatalysis technique, are discussed in detail. The water splitting and hydrogen production depend upon the properties of photocatalysts which rose from the nature, composition and other factors of photocatalysts. Therefore, this study discussed different materials like metal oxides, metal sulphides, nanocomposites, etc. which are used for photocatalytic hydrogen production. In addition, the pros and cons of the utilized materials are discussed to select the best class of materials for hydrogen production from water splitting. This review will help the beginners of this field to understand the basic mechanisms of different hydrogen production techniques along with their advantages and disadvantages. However, it will also help the field experts and industrialists to select the best class of materials for hydrogen evolution from water splitting.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1574-1443	1574-1451		WOS:000539191200002

Fe(III) was found to be the main species in the aqueous solution responsible for photon absorption provided that hydrogen peroxide was not totally consumed. Paracetamol was used as model pollutant at a concentration of 1 mM to validate the model. The illuminated part of the raceway reactor configuration (total length of 80 cm) was operated at two liquid depths (5.0 and 2.5 cm) equivalent to two irradiated reactor volumes (2 and 1 L) and using R-i ratios in the range 0.30-0.65, which changed the dark reactor volume. These values are commonly found in photo-Fenton pilot plants for water treatment and purification. The model successfully fitted the temporal evolution of the dissolved oxygen (O-2) and the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations and the evolution of the total organic carbon (TOC) in solution in both reactor geometries and for different illuminated volume to total volume ratios. The model can be easily extended to model other water contaminants and provides a robust method for process design, process control and optimization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of impurities in the alloy or addition of H3PO4 was found to suppress the corrosion rate. H3PO4 increased the rates of both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions at high overpotentials for all alloys. Except for Cu-containing alloy, H3PO4 had a slight positive effect on PbO2 formation. The self-discharge of PbO2 under polarization or open-circuit conditions increased in the presence of H3PO4 but the positive grid corrosion decreased, except for the As-containing alloy. Impurity-containing alloys showed significantly lower self-discharge rate in the presence of H3PO4 than in its absence. Impedance measurement was able to detect and quantify the formation of the highly insulating inner PbO layer beneath the outer PbSO4 layer and its transformation to the conducting PbO2, during the oxidation of alloys under constant current conditions. H3PO4 significantly enhanced the formation of PbO in the presence of impurities, especially Sb.									1	1	0	0	0	0	1			0001-9704			WOS:000330159200010

This study aims at providing new insights and proposing new interpretations about the mineral-water reactions and the fluid-flow paths mechanisms across the Geneva Basin (GB). Data from previous studies are combined and improved by new ones collected from cold and hot springs and geothermal exploration wells in 2018 and 2020 in the framework of the GEothermies program and HEATSTORE project. Major ions, trace elements, and the isotopes of Oxygen, Hydrogen, Sulfur, Strontium, and Carbo have been analysed and the results show that the sampled waters have a meteoric origin, the carbonate aquifers act as preferential host rocks for geothermal waters, and partial contribution from the Cenozoic sediments can be observed in some samples. The Jura Mountains and the Saleve Ridge are the main catchment areas and an evolution from a pure Ca-HCO3 footprint for the cold springs, to a Na > Ca-HCO3 and a Na-Cl composutions, is observed at the two geothermal wells. The residence time is in the order of a few years for the cold springs and reaches up to 15-20,000 years for the deep wells.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1996-1073		WOS:000803471800001

The obtained samples were characterized by glancing-incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), for a detailed determination of their microstructure, chemical composition, and surface morphology. This work is dedicated to the XPS characterization of a representative LaOF thin film deposited on Si(100) at 500degC. Besides the wide scan spectrum, detailed spectra for the La 3d, F 1s, O 1s, and C 1s regions and related data are presented and discussed. Both the F/La atomic ratio and La 3d peak shape and position point to the formation of stoichiometric LaOF thin films. Moreover, carbon contamination was merely limited to the outermost sample layers.									6	1	0	0	1	0	7			1055-5269			INSPEC:8892041

Interface structure has been studied in situ during deposition of iron on MgO surface, using soft x-ray absorption spectroscopy (SXAS). Sub-monolayer sensitivity of SXAS, combined with in situ measurements as a function of iron layer thickness, allowed one to study the evolution of interface with film thickness. Two different substrates namely MgO (001) single crystal, and a polycrystalline MgO film on Si substrate have been used in order to elucidate the role of the state of MgO surface in controlling the interface structure. It is found that at the interface of iron and MgO film, about two monolayers of Fe3O4 are formed. Fe3O4 being the oxide of iron with the highest heat of formation, the reaction appears to be controlled thermodynamically. On the other hand, on the interface with MgO (001) surface, FeO is formed, suggesting that the reaction is limited by the availability of oxygen atoms. Magnetic behavior of the FeO layer gets modified significantly due to proximity effect of the bulk ferromagnetic iron layer.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000456271100001	30557858

Here, we show that Ni(3)HAB(2) (HAB = hexaaminobenzene), a two-dimensional metal organic framework (MOF), is a selective and active 2e(- )ORR catalyst in buffered neutral electrolytes with a linker-based redox feature that dynamically affects the ORR behaviors. Rotating ring-disk electrode measurements reveal that Ni(3)HAB(2) has high selectivity for 2e(- )ORR (> 80% at 0.6 V vs RHE) but lower Faradaic efficiency due to this linker redox process. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal that under argon gas the charging of the organic linkers causes a dynamic Ni oxidation state, but in O-2-saturated conditions, the electronic and physical structures of Ni3HAB2 change little and oxygen-containing species strongly adsorb at potentials more cathodic than the reduction potential of the organic linker (E-redox similar to 0.3 V vs RHE). We hypothesize that a primary 2e- ORR mechanism occurs directly on the organic linkers (rather than the Ni) when E > E-redox, but when E < E-redox, H2O2 production can also occur through Ni-mediated linker discharge. By operating the bulk electrosynthesis at a low overpotential (0.4 V vs RHE), up to 662 ppm of H2O2 can be produced in a buffered neutral solution in an H-cell due to minimized strong adsorption of oxygenates. This work demonstrates the potential of conductive MOF catalysts for 2e(- )ORR and the importance of understanding catalytic active sites under electrochemical operation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000844339100001	35985015

In this work, the PEC water oxidation on different hematite photoanodes, either bare or modified with cobalt-based oxygen evolution co-catalyst, has been investigated using intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) . The phenomenological rate constants for charge transfer and recombination have been determined at different bias potentials. Their potential dependence trends have been analyzed using a mechanistic model that combines the IMPS theory and the bulk characteristic of the semiconductor. Based on this model, the nature of the formed intermediates during water oxidation is explored. It is found that water oxidation takes place through the coupling of two mobile surface intermediates and two adjacent metal sites are involved in the process. The rate constants for the trapping of the photogenerated holes and the coupling of the mobile surface intermediates have been determined. All investigated photoanodes exhibit comparable rate constants for the trapping as well as for the coupling steps. The surface modification does not significantly influence the trapping and coupling rate constants but remarkably reduces the rate constant of recombination. These results indicate that the efficiency of hematite photoanode is limited by its intrinsic properties and the surface modification has a restricted impact on the overall performance.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1010-6030	1873-2666		WOS:000720331000002

The same is true for the measurements of these isotopes and of the Al-26/Al-27 ratio in presolar grains of circumstellar origin. Non-convective mixing, occurring during both red giant branch (RGB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages, is the explanation commonly invoked to account for the above evidence. Recently, the need for such mixing phenomena on the AGB was questioned, and chemical anomalies usually attributed to them were suggested to be formed in earlier phases. We have therefore re-calculated extra-mixing effects in low-mass stars for both the RGB and AGB stages, in order to verify the above claims. Our results contradict them; we actually confirm that slow transport below the convective envelope occurs also on the AGB. This is required primarily by the oxygen isotopic mix and the Al-26 content of presolar oxide grains. Other pieces of evidence exist, in particular from the isotopic ratios of carbon stars of type N, or C(N), in the Galaxy and in the LMC, as well as of SiC grains of AGB origin. We further show that, when extra-mixing occurs in the RGB phases of Population I stars above about 1.2 M-circle dot, this consumes He-3 in the envelope, probably preventing the occurrence of thermohaline diffusion on the AGB. Therefore, we argue that other extra-mixing mechanisms should be active in those final evolutionary phases.									62	2	0	0	0	0	62			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000279430600010

Using picosecond ab initio molecular dynamics, we probe the initiation of adsorbate-induced diffusion of atomically dispersed platinum on rutile TiO2(110). NVT trajectories spanning 5 ps at 500 K 9reveal that the dynamical stability of the metal atom is governed by its local coordination to the support and adsorbate. Adsorbates that bind the strongest to Pt typically also lead to the fastest diffusion of the metal atom, and all adsorbates weaken Pt-support interactions, resulting in higher diffusion coefficients compared to bare Pt. We note, however, the absence of quantitative correlations between adsorption characteristics (Pt Bader charge, adsorbate binding energy) and ensemble-averaged quantities (diffusion coefficients). A recurring structural motif identified in several trajectories is a near-linear coordination between support oxygen, Pt, and specific adsorbates. These geometries, on account of enhanced metal support interactions, stabilize Pt and inhibit migration over picosecond timescales. We also identify hydrogen bonding events between the adsorbate and support for OH-containing groups. In the case of OH-bound Pt, for instance, we believe that short-lived H-bonds between OH and support promote Pt migration in the beginning of the NVT trajectory, while the subsequent formation of a near-linear geometry stabilizes the Pt atom despite the continued formation of short-lived hydrogen bonds. These observations are consistent with prior studies that report stabilization of isolated metal atoms in the presence of hydroxyl groups.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of any hollow structured carbon nanospheres directly derived from biomass without the use of templates. In this research, a green route to directly convert biomass to nitrogen-doped hollow carbon nanospheres (N-HCSs) was reported, where only glucose and glucosamine were used as the precursors and an aerosol-assisted process was employed. In the process, amino groups of glucosamine triggered the coassembly between glucose and glucosamine, resulting in the structural evolution of hollow structures. The aerosol-based technology ensures the obtained particles have a spherical morphology and are in the nanoscale size range. The as-prepared materials have been thoroughly characterized by SEM, TEM, HAADF-STEM, EELS mapping, XPS, XRD, Raman, and nitrogen adsorption. Owing to the unique structural and surface properties, the resultant N-HCSs exhibited excellent electrochemical properties for energy storage, including a high specific capacitance of 266 F g(-1) at 0.2 A g(-1), long cycling stability with 96.8% of capacitance retained after 3000 cycles, and a fast charge discharge process. This discovery could be adapted to guide the design and synthesis of a variety of hollow materials from biomass for wider applications in the environment and energy fields.									49	3	0	0	3	0	51			2168-0485			WOS:000434491600024

Here, we detail a 0D/2D all-carbon hybrid strategy for constructing a heterostructure of carbon dots (CDots) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to enhance the photocatalytic water oxidation of monoclinic-BiVO4 nanosheets (CBrG). Given the visible-light-harvesting ability and up-conversion characteristics of 0D CDots, more photogenerated electron-hole pairs participated in water oxidation under visible and near-infrared light irradiation. Meanwhile, 0D CDots behaved as electron acceptors on 2D rGO to suppress the recombination of electron-hole pairs. This nature licenses for the feasible electron transfer from excited m-BiVO4 to 0D CDots via electron transfer channels of 2D rGO, facilitating the separated holes to migrate onto the m-BiVO4 surface for water oxidation. Compared with the rGO decorated m-BiVO4 nanosheets (BrG), these merits endow the CBrG with an over 212% enhancement in O-2 yield under visible light irradiation as well as notable O-2 yield under near-infrared light irradiation, and a 1.57-fold increase in apparent quantum efficiency. The enhancement is also verified by the significant growth of center dot OH radicals derived from OH-/H2O oxidation and center dot OOH/center dot O-2(-) radicals originated from O-2 reduction. This work paves a new way for the 0D/2D all-carbon hybrid architecture applied in solar energy conversion. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bayne, CJ								Origins and evolutionary relationships between the innate and adaptive arms of immune systems								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				43	2			293	299		10.1093/icb/43.2.293				APR 2003	2003	Long before vertebrates first appeared, protists, plants and animals had evolved diverse, effective systems of innate immunity. Ancestors of the vertebrates utilized components of the complement system, protease-inhibitors, metal-binding proteins, carbohydrate-binding proteins and other plasma-born molecules as Immoral agents of defense. In these same animals, immunocytes endowed with a repertoire of defensive behaviors expressed Toll-like receptors. They made NADPH oxidase, superoxide dismutase and other respiratory burst enzymes to produce toxic oxygen radicals, and nitric oxide synthase to produce nitric oxide. Antimicrobial peptides; and lytic enzymes were in their armory. Immune responses were orchestrated by cytokines. Furthermore, genes within the immunoglobulin superfamily were expressed to meet a variety of needs possibly including defense. However, recombination activating genes played no role. With the acquisition of one or more transposases and the resulting capacity to generate diverse receptors from immunoglobulin gene fragments, the adaptive (lymphoid) arm of the immune system was born. This may have coincided with the elaboration of the neural crest. Naturally, the role of the adaptive arm was initially subservient to the defensive functions of the pre-existing innate arm. The strong selective advantages that stemmed from having "sharp-shooters" (cells making antigen-specific receptors) on the defense team ensured their retention. Refined through evolution, adaptive immunity, even in mammals, remains dependent upon cells of the innate series (e.g., dendritic cells) for signals driving their functional maturation. This paper calls for some fresh thinking leading to a clearer vision of the origins and co-evolution of the two arms of modern immune systems, and suggests a possible neural origin for the adaptive immune system.

How to uniformly disperse and firmly fix Pt NPs on carbon matrix with suitable particle size for catalysis is still a big challenge. Herein, to prevent the agglomeration and shedding of Pt NPs, Ni species is introduced and are evenly dispersed in the surface of carbon matrix in the form of Ni-N-C active sites (Ni ZIF-NC). The Ni sites can be used to anchor Pt NPs, and then effectively limit the further growth and agglomeration of Pt NPs during the reaction process. Compared with commercial Pt/C catalyst, Pt@Ni ZIF-NC, with ultralow Pt loading (7 wt%) and ideal particle size (2.3 nm), not only increases the active center, but also promotes the catalysis kinetics, greatly improving the ORR and HER catalytic activity. Under acidic conditions, its half-wave potential (0.902 V) is superior to commercial Pt/C (0.861 V), and the mass activity (0.38 A per mg Pt) at 0.9 V is 4.7 times that of Pt/C (0.08 A per mg Pt). Besides, it also shows outstanding HER performance. At 20 and 30 mV, its mass activity is even 2 and 6 times that of Pt/C, respectively. Whether it is under ORR or HER conditions, it still shows excellent durability. These undoubtedly indicate the realization of dual-functional catalysts with low-Pt and high-efficiency properties.

The quest for the renewable, eco-friendly and economic energy resources is in progression tomitigate the energy demands. In this context, cogent energy alternatives are under investigations to develop innovative strategies based on renewable, affordable and widely available resources. In these perspectives, Metal Sulfides (MS) and their derivatives are sensible, operative and eco-friendly electrocatalysts with ultra-modern physiognomies because of extensive durability, porous topography, high surface area, extensive vari-eties, cost effectiveness, simplicity and chemical functionality. Various synthetic strategies such as hydrothermal, solvothermal and other miscellaneous techniques have been followed to design metal sulfides and their derivatives of countless compositions. The synthesized metal sulfides and their derivatives are favored for electrocatalytic solicitations with characteristic synergetic and plasmonic effects in order to explorehydrogen evolutionreaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), overall water splitting (OWS), carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR), and super capacitance. Appraising these synthetic strategies and electrocat-alytic features, metal sulfides could be influential to attempt new, renewable and eco-friendly energy resources.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000870699900009

Microstructure evolution and mechanical behavior of as-sintered and as-extruded composites had been systematically investigated. After extrusion, due to the large deformation degree, significant grain refinement occurred and the long axes of whiskers were almost parallel to the extrusion direction. Almost no micro-voids were caused by the fractured TiBw as a consequence of three-dimensional compressive stress during the extrusion process. The mechanical properties results demonstrated that the ultimate tensile strength, elongation and Vickers hardness of the as-extruded composites all increased compared with that of the as-sintered composites. Moreover, there was an inhomogeneous microstructure in the as-extruded composites. The edge part possessed stronger grain refinement and much weaker texture than that of the central part owing to the different deformation degree. The interface between the titanium matrix composites and the capsule (45# steel) was relatively flat with no interfacial reaction, which showed the superiority of the 45# steel as the capsule for hot canned extrusion. Oxygen content result illustrated that there was no significant oxidation of titanium matrix during the sintering and extrusion process.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1526-6125	2212-4616		WOS:000591061200003

Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the char structure. The first-order Raman spectra in the range between 800 and 1800 cm(-1) and the second-order Raman spectra in the range between 2200 and 3300 cm(-1) were deconvoluted to understand the detailed structural features of char. Our results show that the differences in the intraparticle heat and mass transfer between small and big particle sizes during pyrolysis are largely responsible for the difference in the char yield during gasification, and the intraparticle gas diffusion is not a rate-limited step during the subsequent gasification of char for the conditions used in this study. As revealed by Raman spectroscopy, there are no significant changes in the overall Raman-active oxygen species and aromatic ring systems among different biomass particle sizes during gasification.

In this work, the fabrication of porous CoMnB electrocatalyst is demonstrated with the incorporation of boron into the Co-Mn matrix by an electrochemical approach for bifunctional water electrocatalysis for the first time. The optimized CoMnB electrocatalyst demonstrates an excellent bifunctionality with a low 2-E turnover voltage of 1.59 V at 20 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. The CoMnB shows a comparable water-splitting current at low current range as compared with the standard benchmark electrodes of Pt/C parallel to RuO2 in 1 M KOH. Then, the CoMnB outperforms the benchmarks at above 800 mA cm(-2), indicating a better H-2 and O-2 generation performance at the industrial operational condition of high current range. The CoMnB also exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity in real sea water +1 m KOH. In addition, the porous CoMnB electrocatalyst exhibits an excellent stability with stable current for continuous 72 h operation at high current and excellent repeatability after 1000 cycles. The result ranks the CoMnB as one of the best transition metal-based water-splitting electrocatalysts at low cost with an easy fabrication approach.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2366-7486			WOS:000833429900001

In this Article, we show that defect-ion interaction is one of the key parameters that control many of the electrical, optical, structural, and electrocatalytic properties of MoS2. The results show for the first time that modulation of the concentration of intrinsic defects in MoS2 containing an excess of 'S' atoms in the lattice through Li+ insertion can lead to a new type of semiconductor-to-insulator-to-metal electronic phase transition with a concomitant change in the electrical conductivity from p-type to n-type, and a reversible 1T -> 2H -> IT structural phase transformation. Using near-infrared photoluminescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements to directly monitor defect-ion interactions, it is shown that the observed changes are a direct result of changes in the electronic structure resulting from passivation of S-excess defects by Li+ and subsequently from the formation of electrochemically induced S-deficient vacancy defects in MoS2. The effects of these broad range modulation on the catalytic rates of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions are shown. The structure-property-activity correlation shown here has important implications for chalcogenides-based semiconductors in general.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000458706000014

The electrolysis of the complex at +1.1 V vs Ag/AgCl in 0.1 M potassium phosphate at pH 12 leads to the formation of a nanoporous Co(II) hydroxide/phosphate thin film on the printed carbon electrode. The deposited surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The modified electrode (Co-PCE-12) is stable for more than 34 h during the continuous electrolysis. The modified electrode exhibits a high water oxidation catalytic activity of 6.5 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 580 mV (0.9 V vs Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) at pH 12) with 98% Faradaic yield.

For the first time in the literature, Li doped nano-porous BiVO4 photoanode showed complete bulk charge separation efficiency (similar to 100%) at 1.23 V vs RHE along with enhanced light absorption for water splitting. Li doping showed an increase (>20 times) in the photoelectrochemical water splitting compared to pristine BiVO4 photoanode. In particular, oxygen evolution catalyst was also employed for further improving the photoelectrochemical performance (4.2 +/- 0.18 mA cm(-2)) of Li:BiVO4 photoanodes. The density functional theory calculations showing the formation of inter-band with band gap reduction due to interstitial Li doping in BiVO4 structure support enhancement in photoelectrochemical performance. In addition, Li doping in the BiVO4 lattice void positions led to a record photocurrent density of 7.3 +/- 0.36 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs RHE in the presence of hole scavenger under one sun illumination. Further, present study systematically demonstrates role of Li in BiVO4 host for water oxidation through a detailed characterization and study of optical and charge transport properties.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000509632300080

Especially, transition-metal Fe-based OER catalysts, despite their earth-abundant, cost-efficient, and environmentally benign superiorities over Co- and Ni-based materials, have received relatively insufficient attention because of their poor apparent OER activities. Herein, by rational design, we report Ni-modified pyrite (FeS2) spheres with yolk-shell structure that could serve as pre-electrocatalyst precursors to induce a highly active nickel-iron oxyhydroxide via in situ electrochemical topological transformation under the OER process. Notably, as confirmed by the results of X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, Ni doping could effectively regulate the intrinsic electronic structure of FeS2 to realize a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, which endows FeS2 with dramatically improved conductivity and water adsorption ability, providing prequisites for subsequent topological transformation. Moreover, systematic post-characterizations further reveal that the optimal Ni-FeS2-0.5 sample completely converts to amorphous Ni-doped FeOOH via an in situ electrochemical transformation with yolk-shell structure well-preserved under the OER conditions. The electronic structure modulation combined with electrochemical topotactic transformation strategies well stimulate the reactive Fe sites in Ni-FeS2-0.5, which show impressively low overpotentials of 250 and 326 mV to drive the current densities (j) of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, and a Tafel slope as small as 34 mV dec(-1) for the OER process. When assembled as a water electrolyzer for the overall water splitting, Ni-FeS2-0.5 can display a low voltage of 1.55 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming most of the transition-metal-based bifunctional electrocatalysts to date. This work may provide new insight into the rational design of other high-performance Fe-based OER electrocatalysts and inspire the exploration of cost-effective, ecofriendly electrocatalysts to meet the demand for future sustainable development.									33	3	0	0	2	0	35			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000470332200052	31074996

X-Ray structural evidence places the guanidinium cation of the conserved arginine 357 residue of CP43 within a few Angstroms to the Mn4Ca cluster of the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) and has been implicated as a possible carbonate binding site. To test the hypothesis, the serine mutant, CP43-R357S, from Synechocystis PCC 6803 was investigated by PSII variable fluorescence (F-v/F-m) and simultaneous flash 02 yield measurements in cells and thylakoid membranes. The R357S mutant assembles PSII-WOC centers, but is unable to grow photo autotrophically. Reconstitution of O-2 evolution by photoactivation and the occurrence of period-four oscillations of F-v/F-m establishes that the R357S mutant contains an assembled Mn4Ca cluster, but turnover is impaired as seen by an 11-fold larger Kok double miss parameter and faster decay of upper S states. Using pulsed light to avoid photoinactivation, wild-type cells and thylakoid membranes exhibit a 2-4-fold loss in O-2 evolution rate upon partial bicarbonate depletion under multiple turnover conditions, while the R357S mutant is unaffected by bicarbonate. Arginine R357 appears to function in binding a (bi)carbonate ion essential to normal catalytic turnover of the WOC. The quantum yield of electron donation from the WOC into PSII increases with decreasing turnover rate in R357S mutant cells and involves an aborted two-flash pathway that is distinct from the classical four-flash pattern. We speculate that an altered photochemical mechanism for O-2 production occurs via formation of hydrogen peroxide, by analogy to other treatments that retard the kinetics of proton release into the lumen.									32	0	0	0	26	0	32			1474-905X	1474-9092		WOS:000234416900025	16307112

The aim of this work is to prepare aligned carbon nanofibrous (ACFs) membrane by electrospinning technology and then dope with SnO2-Sb to electrocatalytic degrade TC. The in-situ growth of SnO2-Sb on the carbon nanofiber surface to fabricate SnO2-Sb/ACFs membrane can increase the oxygen evolution reaction potential and improve conductivity. And the SnO2-Sb/ACFs membrane was used as the anodic membrane of a flowthrough mode electrochemical membrane reactor to remove TC in aqueous solutions. The outstanding degradation performance of SnO2-Sb/ACFs membrane on TC was investigated systematically. The results show that the 3-layer SnO2-Sb/ACFs-3 membranes can effectively degrade 20 mg/L TC at an applied potential of 2.5 V. Moreover, SnO2-Sb/ACFs-3 membrane shows excellent degradation stability after 10 cycles of degradation experiments. For exploring the possible TC degradation pathways, HPLC-MS was used to identify the main intermediates during the electrochemical oxidation process. The anodic membrane electrode prepared in this work puts forward a new idea for the safe and efficient degradation of TC.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000795160400001

Ngb, predominantly expressed in nerve cells, is of ancient evolutionary origin and is homologous to nerve-globins of invertebrates. Cygb, present in many different tissues, shares common ancestry with myoglobin (Mb) and can be traced to early vertebrate evolution. Ngb is held to facilitate O-2 diffusion to the mitochondria and to protect neuronal cells from hypoxic-ischemic insults, may be an oxidative stress-responsive sensor protein for signal transduction, and may carry out enzymatic activities, such as NO/O-2 scavenging. Cygb is linked to collagen synthesis, may provide O-2 for enzymatic reactions, and may be involved in a ROS (NO)-signaling pathway(s). Ngb and Cgb display the classical three-over-three alpha-helical fold of Hb and Mb, and are endowed with a hexa-coordinate heme-Fe atom, in their ferrous and ferric forms, having the heme distal HisE7 residue as the endogenous ligand. Reversible hexa- to penta-coordination of the heme Fe atom modulates ligand binding properties of Ngb and Cygb. Moreover, Ngb and Cygb display a tunnel/cavity system within the protein matrix held to facilitate ligand channeling to/from the heme, multiple ligand copies storage, multi-ligand reactions, and conformational transitions supporting ligand binding.

Although extensive studies have been made, the variation of palladium species on the surface of reducible supports still needs to be clarified due to the complex metal-support interactions (MSI). Herein, investigations were performed on Pd/TiO2 catalysts, which were tailored by regulating the phase structure of TiO2. The thermal treatment of TiO2 at 1000 degrees C gave rise to a "snow cookie"-like catalyst structure comprising amorphous surface palladium species and rutile TiO2 supports. The as-prepared catalyst possessed abundant Pd2+ species, Ti3+ ions and adsorbed oxygen species, which meanwhile could facilitate the re-oxidation of Pd-0 back to PdO, and thus completely catalyzed the combustion of CH4 to CO2 at as low as 370 degrees C. However, some Pd2+ would be oxidized into Pd4+ on the working catalyst, and then enter the TiO2 lattice to form PdxTi1-xO2, thus exerting a detrimental effect on the oxygen exchange between bulk TiO2 and surface Pd species. Consequently, the re-oxidation ability was weakened, accompanied by the decrease of active PdO species, resulting in the loss of activity during on-stream tests.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000618190800008

In order to fabricate fine-grained tungsten heavy alloys with outstanding performances, ultrafine 93W-4.9Ni-2.1Fe composite powder fabricated using a two-step reduction approach was selected as raw material. Microstructure and mechanical properties were experimentally examined to investigate the influence of ZrB2 addition. Meanwhile, transmission electron microscope and energy spectral analysis identified that ZrO2 particles were generated through the reaction between ZrB2 and oxygen from the grain boundaries. The ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and hardness of 93W-0.75ZrB(2) alloys could reach to 963 +/- 16 MPa, 18.4 +/- 1.3% and 387.6 +/- 4.4 HV, respectively, benefitted from the combination of fine-grained strengthening and oxide dispersion strengthening mechanisms. The W grains without observable texture were homogeneously distributed in the gamma matrix phase based on electron backscattered diffraction analysis. Moreover, it was determined that the main fracture types of 93W-ZrB2 alloys were W grain cleavage failure and ductile matrix rupture, closely related to the ZrB2 content in alloys. The current work provided a possible method for purifying the boundaries and enhancing the strength and elongation of W-Ni-Fe alloys simultaneously.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0921-5093	1873-4936		WOS:000696933200003

Stochastic generative models inspired different scenarios to explain the growth of interaction networks during evolution. The power law and the associated properties appeared so ubiquitous in complex networks that they were qualified as "universal laws". However, these properties are no longer observed when the data are subjected to statistical tests: in most cases, the data do not fit the expected theoretical models, and the cases of good fitting merely result from sampling artefacts or improper data representation. The field of network biology seems to be founded on a series of myths, i.e. widely believed but false ideas. The weaknesses of these foundations should however not be considered as a failure for the entire domain. Network analysis provides a powerful frame for understanding the function and evolution of biological processes, provided it is brought to an appropriate level of description, by focussing on smaller functional modules and establishing the link between their topological properties and their dynamical behaviour.									129	0	0	0	88	0	129			1742-206X	1742-2051		WOS:000271727600010	20023717

The electro-oxidation of renewable feedstocks offers an alternative anode couple to the (high-overpotential) electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction for developing low-voltage electrolysers. Meanwhile, the exploration of new membrane materials is also important in order to try and reduce the capital costs of electrolysers. In this work, we synthesise and characterise a previously unreported anion-exchange membrane consisting of a fluorinated polymer backbone grafted with imidazole and trimethylammonium units as the ion-conducting moieties. We then investigate the use of this membrane in a lignin-oxidising electrolyser. The new membrane performs comparably to a commercially-available anion-exchange membrane (Fumapem) for this purpose over short timescales (delivering current densities of 4.4 mA cm(-2) for lignin oxidation at a cell potential of 1.2 V at 70 degrees C during linear sweep voltammetry), but membrane durability was found to be a significant issue over extended testing durations. This work therefore suggests that membranes of the sort described herein might be usefully employed for lignin electrolysis applications if their robustness can be improved.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6				2077-0375		WOS:000666207500001	34199371

They have some of the lowest O-16/O-18 ratios measured in any star (between 1 and 25) and are also enhanced compared to solar, in fluorine and the s-process elements. In the paper by Menon et al., post-WD-merger stellar evolution models of RCBs constructed at solar metallicity could reproduce the above chemical signatures. In this work, we construct new post-WD-merger models with a realistic RCB metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.4, using the same methodology as Menon et al. An important aspect of this method was the inclusion of an artificial mixing process during the evolution of the models, which was essential to reproduce the isotopic ratios of RCBs. The surface of our new post-merger models have O-16/O-18 ratios of 9.5-30, C-12/C-13 ratios of 1500-7000 which overlap with the values recorded for RCBs, along with their enhancements in fluorine and in s-process elements. We then explore the possibility that a fraction of pre-solar low-density graphite grains, those with comparable O-16/O-18 and C-12/C-13 ratios as RCBs, were formed in the outflows of these stars. On assuming that the gas ejected by RCBs would have mixed with its surrounding interstellar material of solar composition, our models can reproduce some of the isotopic ratios of these graphite grains, thereby strengthening the hypothesis that RCB stars could be a source of some pre-solar graphite grains.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000454578700063

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements revealed that the LSF thin films pre-calcined at 900 degrees C (LSF-900) exhibited much faster electrochemical activity loss than did LSF pre-calcined at 700 degrees C (LSF-700). As similar losses in surface area were determined upon scanning electron microscopy image analyses of samples, microstructure evolution was excluded as a possible reason for the difference in degradation rates. Upon X-ray diffraction analyses and comparison of results with literature, it was suggested that small amounts of Ruddlesden-Popper type (La, Sr)(2)FeO4 (214) phases were present throughout the 100 hour exposure of both LSF-700 and LSF-900 to 700 degrees C, thus not affecting the long-term performance degradation rates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the ratio of surface-bound Sr to the lattice-bound one increased significantly in LSF-900, suggesting electrochemically inactive SrO/Sr(OH)(2)/SrCO3 rich layer formation and thus contributing to fast activity loss. Overall, it was established that microstructural evolution was not the sole source of degradation in LSF-based cathodes. Since LSF thin films deposited by a solution precursor onto YSZ electrolytes constitute a model structure, the results obtained in the present study can also provide useful information on the degradation of LSF-YSZ composite cathodes prepared by LSF infiltration into YSZ scaffolds.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000576050300008

It was concluded that E690 steel was highly sensitive to SCC, which was jointly determined by local anodic dissolution (AD) and hydrogen embrittlement (HE) both caused by dissolved O-2. In addition to these functions, hydrogen oxidation catalyzed by ferric ion was found. There was a critical oxygen concentration, approximately 21% by volume, between these two different roles. Below this value, the increase in the oxygen concentration promoted the synergistic effect of AD and HE, resulting in the increase in SCC susceptibility. However, above this value, worse general corrosion offset crack initiation as well as the oxidation of hydrogen catalyzed by ferric ions reduced the SCC susceptibility.									56	4	0	0	0	0	58			0010-938X	1879-0496		WOS:000457950400036

Our experimental results demonstrated that either increasing plasma power or decreasing silane concentration always can lead to structural transition from amorphous silicon to microcrystalline silicon, and then the electrical properties changed along with the micro-structural evolution. By optimizing process parameters and using gas purifier, the oxygen concentration was prohibited effectively and then device-quality muc-Si:H thin films have been got at a relative high deposition rate. Their applications as absorber layers in single-junction muc-Si : H solar cells with 1.5 mum i-layer yielded conversion efficiency of 5.22% without ZnO back reflector and without optimizing p-layer and p/i interface.									1	1	0		0	0	1			1000-985X			INSPEC:8780698

Different bubble diameters that are comparable to the thickness of the normal shock wave (Mach=2) were taken into account. The evolution of bubble morphology indicates that viscous effects (diffusion and dissipation) leads to the disappearance of some typical phenomena, including the shock focusing, positive viscosity deposition and wake-like cross-section. Meanwhile, the viscous dissipation is mainly responsible for the enstrophy degeneration, which is enhanced by reducing the bubble scale and heat release in combustion. The observed combustion process, which is prominent near the bubble core, is more evident with a larger bubble diameter and unlikely to occur with the smallest bubble diameter. The corresponding reason is that the strong viscous diffusion reduces the collision events between fuel and oxygen molecules. In addition, a time-scale analysis was conducted to illustrate the viscous diffusion in the hydrodynamic and chemical reaction time-scales with different bubble diameters. As a consequence, a changing dimensionless Damkohler number was presented to understand the dominant diffusion effect in microscale supersonic premixed combustion. (C) 2019 The Combustion Institute.

With the goal of understanding how these two enzymes with nearly identical Zn2+ bimetallo sites achieve high selectivity for hydrolysis of either phosphate monoesters or diesters, we have measured a promiscuous sulfatase activity in NPP. sulfate esters are nearly isosteric with phosphate esters but carry less charge, offering a probe of electrostatic contributions to selectivity. NPP exhibits sulfatase activity with k(cat)/K-M value of 2 x 10(-5) M-1 s(-1), similar to the R166S mutant of alkaline phosphatase. We further report the effects of thio-substitution on phosphate monoester and diester reactions. Reactivities with these noncognate Substrates illustrate a reduced dependence of NPP reactivity oil the charge of the nonbridging oxygen situated between the Zn2+ ions relative to that in alkaline phosphatase. This reduced charge dependence call explain about 10(2) of the 10(7)-fold differential catalytic proficiency for the most similar monoester and diester substrates in the two enzymes. The results further suggest that active site contacts to Substrate oxygen atoms that do not contact the Zn2+ ions may play an important role in defining the selectivity of the enzymes.									45	0	0	0	34	0	45			0006-2960			WOS:000261202300024	18975918

By postdeposition annealing under NH3 vapor (PDN) at 600 degrees C, an InN layer formed at the HfO2/InP interface, and ionized NHx was incorporated in the HfO2 film. We demonstrate that structural changes resulting from nitridation of HfO2/InP depend on the film thickness (i.e., a single-crystal interfacial layer of h-InN formed at thin (2 nm) HfO2/InP interfaces, whereas an amorphous InN layer formed at thick (>6 nm) HfO2/InP interfaces). Consequently, the tetragonal structure of HfO2 transformed into a mixture structure of tetragonal and monoclinic because the interfacial InN layer relieved interfacial strain between HfO2 and InP. During postdeposition annealing (PDA) in HfO2/InP at 600 degrees C, large numbers of oxidation states were generated as a result of interfacial reactions between interdiffused oxygen impurities and out-diffused 1nP substrate elements. However, in the case of the PDN of HfO2/InP structures at 600 degrees C, nitrogen incorporation in the HfO2 film effectively blocked the out-diffusion of atomic In and P, thus suppressing the formation of oxidation states. Accordingly, the number of interfacial defect states (D-it) within the band gap of InP was significantly reduced, which was also supported by DFT calculations. Interfacial InN in HfO2/InP increased the electron-barrier height to similar to 0.6 eV, which led to low-leakage-current density in the gate voltage region over 2 V.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000333551500020	24467437

This study was focused on the synthesis of alpha-, delta- and beta-MnO2 by wet chemical hydrothermal method for application as the cathodic catalyst in PFC. The crystallographic evolution was performed by varying the ratios of KMnO4 to MnSO4. The mechanism of the PFC with the MnO2/C as cathode was also discussed. Results showed that the catalytic activity of MnO2/C cathode was mainly predominated by their crystallographic structures which included Mn-O bond strength and tunnel size, following order of alpha- > delta- > beta-MnO2/C. Interestingly, it was discovered that the specific surface areas (S-BET) of different crystal phases did not give an impact on the PFC performance. However, the P-max could be significantly influenced by the micropore surface area (S-micro) in the comparison among alpha-MnO2. Furthermore, the morphological transformation carried out by altering the hydrothermal duration demonstrated that the nanowire alpha-M3(24 h)/C with 1:1 ratio of KMnO4 and MnSO4 yielded excellent PFC performance with a P-max of 2.8680 mW cm(-2) and the lowest R-int of 700 Omega.

Nonetheless, the development of cathode materials with this electrochemical reaction mechanism faces great challenges in terms of voltage attenuation and irreversible loss of capacity. As a result of the complexity of its structure, the failure mechanism is not well understood. Here we conduct STEM coupled with EELS on a typical anionic redox material of sodium ion batteries (Na-0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O-2) after the electrochemical cycle. Surprisingly, it was found that the transition metal ions on the surface of the particles migrated into the alkali metal layer, forming a spinel structure, and resulting in a decrease in the valence of the transition metal on the surface. The possibility of this kind of migration is confirmed, and the most likely migration path is calculated by DFT. Combining the electrochemical curve and XPS spectroscopy, we found the evolution of the charge transfer mechanism, which gradually changes from anion to cation with the progress of the electrochemical cycle. The structural reconstruction of the particle surface and the evolution of the charge transfer mechanism lead to the voltage hysteresis and capacity loss of the cathode. The new failure mechanism provides an important basis for solving the problems of this type of material for sodium cathode.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000852995300004

A variable fluorescence study showed that freezing and subsequent thawing of PS II particles inhibited the light-induced electron transport in the donor side of PS II. The freezing-thawing treatment of PS II particles in the absence of glycerol suppressed the rate of photosynthetic oxygen evolution by 70-75% and led to the loss of 80-85% of manganese. In addition, the freeze-thaw treatment reduced the catalase-like activity and accelerated the photoproduction of hydrogen peroxide. During exposure of PS II particles to a high irradiance after freezing-thawing pretreatment, photoinhibition occurred faster than during illumination of untreated PS II particles. The extent of photoinhibition in PS II particles increased with the duration of low-temperature treatment. The addition of an exogenous electron donor 1,5-diphenylcarbazide to frozen-thawed preparations prior to irradiation reduced the rate of photoinhibition. It is suggested that the light-induced hydrogen peroxide is involved in the photoinhibition of PS II particles subjected to low temperature treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:A1997WQ30900006

The results show that with the increase of pH value, the polarization resistance of A572Gr.65 steel also increases, meanwhile the free-corrosion potential of A572Gr.65 steel moves positively, while the free-corrosion current density decreases. The corrosion resistance of steel in alkaline solution is the best. When the solution is acidic, the main corrosion product is gamma-FeOOH. High concentration of H+ can promote the generation of impedance arc and destroy the passive film on the surface of A572Gr.65 steel. In addition, H+ will generate hydrogen in the reaction process, make corrosion products loose, and accelerate the corrosion process. In this process, the hydrogen evolution reaction of cathode is the controlling step for the whole process. When the pH value becomes neutral or alkaline gradually, OH- will promote the transformation of gamma-FeOOH to dense Fe3O4 and alpha-FeOOH. The dense corrosion products will hinder the diffusion of corrosive ions and dissolved oxygen, protect the substrate effectively and slow down the progress of corrosion. In this process, the formation of corrosion active points on the metal surface and the dissolution rate of anode are the controlling step for the whole process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-4537			INSPEC:22083257

We have started exploring the new technique of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy; this technique can be characterized as a Raman process that uses K-edge energies (1s to 4p, ca. 6550 eV) to obtain L-edge-like spectra (2p to 3d, ca. 650 eV). The relevance of these data to the oxidation states and structure of the Mn complex is presented. We have obtained extended Xray absorption fine structure data from the S-0 and S-3 states and observed heterogeneity in the Mn-Mn distances leading us to conclude that there may be three rather than two di-mu-oxo-bridged units present per tetranuclear Mn cluster. In addition, we have obtained data using Ca and Sr X-ray spectroscopy that provide evidence for a heteronuclear Mn-Ca cluster. The possibility of three di-mu-oxo-bridged Mn-Mn moieties and the proximity of Ca is incorporated into developing structural models for the Mn cluster. The involvement of bridging and terminal O ligands of Mn in the mechanism of oxygen evolution is discussed in the context of our X-ray spectroscopy results.

The asdesigned CdS/NiO HHAs are composed of hexagonal n-type CdS nanoparticles with a size in the range of 20-40 nm attaching to cubic p-type NiO hollow microspheres (HMSs) which are aggregates of porous nanoplates with a thickness of about 20 nm. The photocatalytic water splitting over CdS/NiO HHAs is significantly increased under simulated solar irradiation, among which the most active sample of CdS/NiO-3 (the mass ratio of CdS to NiO is 1:3) exhibits the fastest photocatalytic HER rate of 1.77 mmol.g(-1), h(-1), being 16.2 times than that of pure CdS. The boosted photocatalytic HER could be attributed to the synergistic effect on the proportional p-n heterojunction with special hierarchical hollow and porous morphology, an enhancement of visible light absorption, and an improvement of photoinduced charge separation as well as the photo-stability given by the composite heterojunction. This work shows a viable strategy to design the heterojunction with special morphology for the efficient hydrogen generation by water splitting utilizing solar energy.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000721443500001

Review of oxide coated catalytic titanium anodes performance for metal electrowinning								HYDROMETALLURGY				169				456	467		10.1016/j.hydromet.2017.02.014				MAY 2017	2017	Conventional lead alloys are widely used in the zinc industry, in spite of their high overpotential and Pb contamination of the deposit during zinc electrowinning. The Oxide Coated Catalytic Anodes (OCAs) are considered to improve cathodic zinc purity and decrease cell voltage during zinc electrowinning. Considering the Ti substrate and its coatings such as (70%) IrO2 + (30%) Ta2O5 coatings, the composites of OCAs have low overpotentials 400-500 mV less than Pb-Ag anode. It was found that the oxygen evolution potential of the Ti/(Ir-Co) is 370 mV lower than that of the lead alloy anode. Ta2O5 has more electric resistance than cobalt oxide and can lead to higher overpotentials. Also, RuO2 is an excellent electro-catalytic rutile structure. Considering generally a low cost coating of Ti substrate, Ni is more appreciable than that of zinc for the two systems of Co-Ni and Co-Zn coated over titanium. Addition of certain chemicals to the zinc electrolyte can decrease MnO2 deposition on the OCA anodes during zinc electrolysis. Moreover, the performance of OCA anodes increased with the nanopartides addition of both IrO2 and the Sb-doped SnO2. To improve the service life of Ti substrate, procedures such as recrystallization, annealing treatment and surface anodic treatment could be employed. A conductive carbon polymer has been developed to replace the titanium substrate, which is composed of graphite fibre, carbon black and polyolefin. Finally, aluminum has been studied for matrix because of its good electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Ideal catalysts should possess not only porous architecture for high-density assembly of active sites but also a subtle electronic configuration for the optimized activity at each site. In this context, the development of stable porous hosting materials that allow the incorporation of various metal elements is highly desirable for both experimental optimization and theoretical comparison/prediction. Herein, MOF-derived spongy nanosheet arrays constructed by assembly of carbon encapsulated hetero-metal doped Ni2P nanoparticles is presented as a superior bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting. This hierarchical structure can be stably retained when secondary metal dopants are introduced, providing a flexible platform for electronic modulation. The catalytic origin of activity enhancement via metal (Fe, Cr, and Mn) doping is deciphered through experimental and theoretical investigations. Combining the advantages in both morphological and electronic structures, the optimized catalyst NiMn-P exhibits remarkable activity in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution in the alkaline media, with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.49 V (at 10 mA cm(-2)) and high durability for at least 240 h.									28	1	0	0	0	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000603165700001	33373091

Initiation of underfilm corrosion by application of group I chloride salts to a penetrative coating defect produces an apparent cathodic-driven coating delamination, where the disbondment distance increases linearly with time at high relative humidity, although filiform corrosion (FFC) is also observed in the vicinity of the defect. The disbondment process occurs both in the presence and absence of oxygen, indicating that hydrogen evolution comprises the predominant underfilm cathodic reaction. Post-corrosion elemental analysis of the delaminated region shows an abundance of group I cation, but no chloride. When magnesium chloride or HCl are used to initiate corrosion, then only FFC is produced. The mechanism is discussed in terms of net anodic dissolution at the defect coupled with underfilm cathodic hydrogen evolution, producing organic coating disbondment under conditions where cations are able to transport ionic current within a zone of increased pH.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2397-2106		WOS:000607637400001

Electrolytic water splitting is limited by the thermodynamic barrier of water oxidation. Useful levels of hydrogen production can only be obtained with an electrical energy consumption exceeding 45 kW h kg(-1) H-2. Electrochemical reforming overcomes such thermodynamic limitations by replacing oxygen evolution with the facile oxidation of an alternative substrate. Energy savings of 50% can be obtained using alcohols such as ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.

Herein, we develop an effective vapor ammonization-electroreduction strategy for fabricating a surface-reconstructed and N-modified three dimensional (3D) Cu foam (SN-CF) cathode for highly efficient alkaline HER. The vapor ammonization is effective to enhance the surface roughness of 3D Cu foam (CF), which is beneficial to enhance the catalytically active surface areas and active site density. Meanwhile, the in situ formation of the surface Cu-N species can effectively regulate the electronic structures of surface active sites. As a result, the thus-obtained SN-CF electrocatalyst exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity towards HER in 1.0 M KOH solution, and it requires low overpotentials of 188 and 377 mV at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, SN-CF also exhibits a good cycling stability (95% after 2000 cycles) and long-term durability for 12 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). This work provides a simple and effective strategy for rationally fabricating highly active HER electrocatalysts by synergistically tuning the surface nano structures and coordination environment of transition metals.

Linear sweep voltammetry tests showed that the 2# composite synthesized from 50 wt.% MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O and 50 wt.% GO with a surface density of 1.5 mg cm(-2) exhibited the best catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction. The 2# composite was utilized as the cathodic catalyst in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) to facilitate hydrogen production. In the MEC tests, the nano-Mg(OH)(2)/Gr cathode was comparable with the Pt/C cathode in terms of current densities and energy efficiency. The hydrogen recovery, cathodic hydrogen recovery and hydrogen production rate obtained with nano-Mg(OH)(2)/Gr MEC were 71 +/- 12%, 83 +/- 9% and 0.63 +/- 0.11 m(3) H-2 m(-3) d(-1), slightly higher than those obtained with the Pt/C cathode MEC. The nano-Mg(OH)(2)/Gr cathode exhibited good stability, and it was inexpensive (less than 1.7% of the cost of the Pt/C cathode). These results demonstrated that the nano-Mg(OH)(2)/Gr composite was an effective HER catalyst because of its good catalytic capacity, durability, and low price. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

N-TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared by incomplete thermal oxidation of TiN at different temperatures to achieve self-doping of TiO2 to improve simultaneously the structural, morphological, and electronic properties of conventional TiO2 photocatalyst. The thermal evolution of TiN to oxygen-rich titanium oxynitride (N-TiO2) and subsequently TiO2 at different temperatures is characterized systematically by different tools including XRD, TEM, XPS, UV-vis diffuse reflectance and SPV responses. The synthesized N-TiO2 was coated onto polyester filters using a facile spray coating method. The excellent photocatalytic performance was successfully demonstrated on mineralization of gaseous toluene with fluorescent light irradiation under both static and dynamic flow conditions in a comprehensive custom-built photocatalytic test system. Therefore, it shows promising potential to be utilized in practical air purification applications. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									13	0	0	0	2	1	13			2213-3437			INSPEC:16113973

That is, the membranes have an intrinsic carbonic anhydrase activity. The present review outlines the discovery of thylakoid carbonic anhydrase and presents the evidence that it is a unique isozyme, distinct from other cellular carbonic anhydrases. It appears that at least some thylakoid carbonic anhydrase is closely associated with photosystem II and may be required for electron transport. This would explain why all inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase also inhibit photosystem II. Several speculative functions of thylakoid carbonic anhydrase are discussed These include a possible role in carbon metabolism, in the protonation of plastoquinone, and/or in oxygen evolution.									55	4	5	0	49	0	59			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:A1997WH89500020

Here we report a highly active, robust, cheap, and facilely fabricated O-2-evolving catalyst on a Cu foil, NiB0.45-250/Cu, which forms a NiB0.45/NiOx core-shell hetero-structured nanoparticulate film during anodic electrolysis. The performance of NiB0.45-250/Cu, to produce 10 mA cm(-2) at 296 mV overpotential in 1 M KOH over 60 h, is at par with the best efficiency of earth-abundant electrocatalysts reported to date and surpasses that of IrO2-loaded copper electrode under identical conditions. Experimental evidence and theoretical calculations reveal the correlations of B/Ni atomic ratio and annealing temperature with the morphology, surface microtexture, electrochemical active surface area, and electrical conductivity of NiBx films. Optimal combination of these factors can evidently enhance the catalytic activity of nickel boride electrocatalysts.									60	6	0	0	4	0	60			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000405202800021

In this study, the Ti4O7 REM with high purity was synthesized by mechanical pressing of TiO2 powders followed by thermal reduction to Ti4O7 using the Ti powder as the reducing reagent, where the TiO2 monolith and Ti powder were separated from each other with the distance of about 5 cm in the vacuum furnace. When the temperature was elevated to 1333 K, the Magneli phase Ti4O7 REM with the Ti4O7 content of 98.5% was obtained after thermal reduction for 4 h. Noticeably, the surface and interior of the obtained REM bulk sample has a homogeneous Ti4O7 content. Doping carbon black (0wt%-15wt%) could increase the porosity of the Ti4O7 REM (38-59%). Accordingly, the internal resistance of the electrode and electrolyte and the charge-transfer impedance increased slightly with the increasing carbon black content. The optimum electroactive surface area (1.1 m(2)) was obtained at a carbon black content of 5wt%, which increased by 1.3-fold in comparison with that without carbon black. The as-prepared Ti4O7 REMs show high oxygen evolution potential, approximately 2.7 V/SHE, indicating their appreciable electrocatalytic activity toward the production of center dot OH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000762017600001	35237568

The effects of electrolyte concentration and anodization voltages on the silica incorporation, microstructure and photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) performance of fabricated coatings were investigated and compared in details. The coating formed at 3% SFS concentration and 50V shows good morphology, better thickness with maximum PEC activity and higher oxygen evolution potential than titania and bare electrodes owing to the enhanced photogenerated electron-hole pairs separation. The PEC activity of the samples was evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange (MO) solutions for different periods of time. The removal efficiency was studied as a function of several operation variables, such as various coatings, dye degradation methods, applied voltages, initial dye concentration, initial pH values and chloride ions.

To demonstrate the functionality of the hybrid electrocatalyst, fast and competent electrooxidation of water and glucose is shown. The mechanism of improved catalysis is ascribed to the synergetic catalytic effect of quaternary Cu-Ni-Fe-Co alloy with dendritic morphology along with the highly conductive and spongy structure of the graphene monolayer. It is shown that water oxidation can be performed at a low overpotential of 315 mV to reach a current denisty of 100 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 63.06 mV dec(-1). Fast and sensitive amperometric detection of glucose at low concentrations (>= 1.3 mu M; 4153 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) in alkaline solutions is also presented. The compelling performance of the hybrid catalyst as compared with many noble-metal and non-precious metal electrocatalysts for water oxidation and electrochemical sensing is reported.

The investigations are carried out in slightly acidic sodium sulphate solution. Changes in composition and structure resulting in corrosion treatment are established by energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The surface morphology is examined by SEM. Dissolution of the alloy coating under polarisation runs through dissolution of eta(x)-Zn phase, selective dissolution of Zn from the Gamma(x)-(Zn,Cr) phase and dissolution of Gamma(x)-(Zn,Cr) phase at a potential close to the potential of transpassive dissolution of Cr. A thin Gamma(x)-(Zn,Cr) layer, containing similar to 58 mass%Cr, remains and is mechanically disintegrated after the potential of oxygen evolution is reached. The corrosion tests by total immersion of the coating into corrosive media,show that the time of appearance of red rust is 1.5 times longer than that for Zn coating.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0020-2967			WOS:000242896000006

The Hf7B23Si17C4N45 films were deposited by reactive pulse dc magnetron sputtering and annealed in air at temperatures from 1100 to 1500 degrees C. All annealed films were found to have a two-layered structure composed of the original amorphous and homogeneous layer followed by a nanocomposite oxidized surface layer. The top nanocomposite layer consists of an amorphous SiOx-based matrix and a population of HfO2 nanoparticles with two distinct sublayers. The first sublayer is next to the original amorphous layer and has a dense population of small HfO2 nanoparticles (up to several nanometers) followed by a surface sublayer with coarsened and dispersed HfO2 nanoparticles (up to several tens nm). The HfO2 nanoparticles in the bottom sublayer form by a nucleation and growth process whereas the ones in the surface sublayer coarsen via Ostwald ripening. An estimate of the activation energy for oxygen diffusion through the oxidized layer produced a value around 3.43 eV attesting to the high oxidation resistance of the film. The oxidation resistance mechanism is attributed to the precipitation of HfO2 nanoparticles within a dense SiOx-based matrix and quartz SiO2 in front of the base layer interface that can act as a barrier to heat transfer and O diffusion.

Here, we merge isolated market-grade spinach PSII with 25 nm cystamine-2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone (cys-DCBQ) modified Au-nanoparticles (PSII-AuNPCys-DCBQ) to obtain one of the highest reported photocurrent values to date (35 mA cm(-2) mg(-1) chlorophyll), retaining the native oxygen evolution properties of PSII. More than 80% of the PSII in solution assembles stably onto the AuNPCys-DCBQ. Spectroscopic studies show strong functional association in these hybrid particles. Mechanistic investigations reveal a dual role of the quinone-modified AuNPs, harvesting and transference of the excitation energy to PSII (resulting in similar to 10-fold enhancement of anodic photocurrent in the 500-550 nm irradiation range) and simultaneously improving the electron transfer from PSII into the graphite anode (by almost 6-fold over the entire visible range of light).									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000667711200001

Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is the most promising photocatalyst for water oxidation and has become a hot topic for current research. However, the efficiency achieved with this material to date is far away from the theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, mainly due to the poor photo-induced electron transportation and the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution. Fortunately, great breakthroughs have been made in the past five years in both improving the efficiency and understanding the related mechanism. This review is aimed at summarizing the recent experimental and computational breakthroughs in single crystals modified by element doping, facet engineering, and morphology control, as well as macro/mesoporous structure construction, and composites fabricated by homo/hetero-junction construction and co-catalyst loading. We aim to provide guidelines for the rational design and fabrication of highly efficient BiVO4-based materials for water oxidation.									371	14	0	0	34	0	376			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000344997600002	25325232

Numerical models of supernovae are discussed. Themain problem in devising supernova explosion mechanisms is producing the energy required to disperse the envelope. In theoretical models, it is necessary to solve multi-dimensional problems involving complex physics (3D gas dynamics, neutrino transport, large-scale convective instability, and other important physical processes). In recent years, the development of large-scale convection during supernova explosions has been reconsidered. Self-consistent problems problems in three-dimensional, gas-dynamical instability have been considered. Two-dimensional gas-dynamical calculations taking into account neutrino absorption in the envelope have been performed. The spherically symmetric collapse and neutrino transport were calculated including all reactions, leading to a new understanding of possible paths for the development of supernova theory. The main emphasis is placed on the neutrino transport and the basis for promising multidimensional models taking into account large-scale convective instability.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1063-7729	1562-6881		WOS:000339800900002

PCC 7942 possesses a small psbA multigene family that codes for two distinct forms of the photosystem II reaction-center protein D1 (D1:1 and D1:2). We showed previously that the normally predominant D1 form (D1:1) was rapidly replaced with the alternative D1:2 when cells adapted to a photon irradiance of 50 mumol/m-2.s-1 are shifted to 500 mumol.m-2.s-1 and that this interchange was readily reversible once cells were allowed to recover under the original growth conditions. By using the psbA inactivation mutants R2S2C3 and R2K1 (which synthesize only D1:1 and D1:2, respectively), we showed that this interchange between D1 forms was essential for limiting the degree of photoinhibition as well as enabling a rapid recovery of photosynthesis. In this report, we have extended these findings by examining whether any intrinsic functional differences exist between the two D1 forms that may afford increased resistance to photoinhibition. Initial studies on the rate of D1 degradation at three photon-irradiances (50, 200, and 500 mumol.m-2.s-1) showed that the rates of degradation for both D1 forms increase with increasing photon flux density but that there was no significant difference between D1:1 and D1:2. Analysis of light-response curves for oxygen evolution for the mutants R2S2C3 and R2K1 revealed that cells with photosystem II reaction centers containing D1:2 have a higher apparent quantum yield (almost-equal-to 25%) than cells possessing D1:1. Further studies using chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements confirmed that R2K1 has a higher photochemical yield than R2S2C3; that is, a more efficient conversion of excitation energy from photon absorption into photochemistry. We believe that the higher photochemical efficiency of reaction centers containing D1:2 is causally related to the preferential induction of D1:2 at high light and thus may be an integral component of the protection mechanism within Synechococcus sp.

Reducing the size of the lanthanide cations enhanced the deformation of the perovskite structures and decreased the dimension of the primitive unit cells. Meanwhile, the oxygen nonstoichiometry (delta) values at elevated temperatures slightly increased. The electrical conductivity degraded with smaller lanthanide cation sizes, while the thermal expansion coefficients (TECs) tended to decrease. These property changes were diagnosed with respect to the corresponding structural evolutions. Sm0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta was identified to be the optimal composition after an overall property assessment. This composition exhibited an average TEC (similar to 14 x 10(-6)K(-1) between 40 and 1000 degrees C) compatible with IT-SOFC electrolytes, eligible electrical conductivity and good electrocatalytic activity. The good overall properties of Sm0.3Sr0.7Fe0.7Cr0.3O3-delta demonstrate that this composition is a promising cathode material for IT-SOFCs.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000441491900034		
J	Moniruzzaman, Md; Lakshmi, Buddolla Anantha; Kim, Sanghyo; Kim, Jongsung					moniruzzaman, md/0000-0002-8900-2752			Preparation of shape-specific (trilateral and quadrilateral) carbon quantum dots towards multiple color emission								NANOSCALE				12	22			11947	11959		10.1039/d0nr02225j				JUN 14 2020	2020	Little progress has been achieved relating to the preparation of shape-specific carbon quantum dots (CQDs) with a well-ordered edge structure and multi-color fluorescence from a single precursor by monitoring and controlling the reaction time. Selecting phloroglucinol (having suitable three-fold symmetry,C-3h; symmetry elements: E, C-3, C-3(2), sigma(h), S-3, S-3(-1)) as a precursor of CQDs is useful for monitoring the shape and structure of CQDs during dehydration mediated controlled growth, which assists to better focus on their formation and PL emission mechanism. We report the rapid synthesis of novel shape-specific (trilateral and quadrilateral) CQDs with multi-color fluorescence emission [blue (B-CQDs), green (G-CQDs), and yellow (Y-CQDs)] by controlling the reaction time. The mechanism of controlled bottom-up growth involves six-membered ring cyclization of the single precursor (phloroglucinol) through the elimination of neighboring active -OH and -H groups in a sulfuric acid medium. Interestingly, wide-range multi-color fluorescence emission of non-nitrogenous CQDs is achieved based on solvatochromism. We consider that the evolution of the tunable photoluminescence (PL) emission can be attributed to both the size of the conjugated domain and oxygen-/sulfur-containing edge electronic states. Furthermore, the multi-color fluorescence CQDs are successfully used as propitious fluorescent probes for multi-color cell (HeLa) and zebra fish larvae imaging owing to an effective intracellular distribution and good biocompatibility.									21	1	0	0	4	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000542747100014	32458861	
J	Belhaj, Khaoula; Lin, Baiqing; Mauch, Felix				Mauch, Felix/O-1717-2014	Mauch, Felix/0000-0001-5150-2711			The chloroplast protein RPH1 plays a role in the immune response of Arabidopsis to Phytophthora brassicae								PLANT JOURNAL				58	2			287	298		10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03779.x				APR 2009	2009	Plant immune responses to pathogens are often associated with enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), known as the oxidative burst, and with rapid hypersensitive host cell death (the hypersensitive response, HR) at sites of attempted infection. It is generally accepted that the oxidative burst acts as a promotive signal for HR, and that HR is highly correlated with efficient disease resistance. We have identified the Arabidopsis mutant rph1 (resistance to Phytophthora 1), which is susceptible to the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora brassicae despite rapid induction of HR. The susceptibility of rph1 was specific for P. brassicae and coincided with a reduced oxidative burst, a runaway cell-death response, and failure to properly activate the expression of defence-related genes. From these results, we conclude that, in the immune response to P. brassicae, (i) HR is not sufficient to stop the pathogen, (ii) HR initiation can occur in the absence of a major oxidative burst, (iii) the oxidative burst plays a role in limiting the spread of cell death, and (iv) RPH1 is a positive regulator of the P. brassicae-induced oxidative burst and enhanced expression of defence-related genes. Surprisingly, RPH1 encodes an evolutionary highly conserved chloroplast protein, indicating a function of this organelle in activation of a subset of immune reactions in response to P. brassicae. The disease resistance-related role of RPH1 was not limited to the Arabidopsis model system. Silencing of the potato homolog StRPH1 in a resistant potato cultivar caused susceptibility to the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans.									33	2	0	0	31	0	37			0960-7412	1365-313X		WOS:000265040700009	19170932

A significant challenge is the design of vacancy states, which include its type, distribution, and accessibility. Here, well-dispersed and vertically aligned MoS2 nanosheets with an in-plane selectively cleaved Mo-S bond on a carbon matrix (c-MoS2-C) have been prepared by a self-engaged strategy, which synergistically realizes uniform vacancy manufacturing and three-dimensional (3D) self-assembly of the defective MoS2 nanosheets. X-ray adsorption spectroscopy investigation confirms that the cleaved MoS2 basal plane generates newly active edge sites, where the Mo centers feature unsaturated coordination geometry. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exposed interior edge Mo sites represent new active centers for hydrogen adsorption/desorption. As expected, the synthesized c-MoS2-C exhibits markedly enhanced hydrogen evolution activity and superior stability. This in-plane activation strategy could be extended to other types of transition-metal dichalcogenides and catalytic reaction systems.									41	1	0	0	0	0	40			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000624334100040	33550800

Then, they were annealed at 600 degrees C under different processing conditions to obtain titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts. All catalysts were characterised by means of XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, UV-vis DRS, FT-IR, N-2 adsorbtion-desorbtion and fluorescence lifetime. Results indicated that after the treatment in air, V free HTOHSs were transformed into open-ended hollow tubes with uniform length of similar to 5 mu m and diameter of 1 pm, and walls of hollow tubes consisted of aggregated nanosheets. Furthermore, HTOHS crystallised into anatase TiO2 (white) phase. The treatment in N-2 atmosphere led to the breaking of longer tubes into shorter ones. In contrast, after the treatment in N-2 atmosphere or by reduction using NaBH4 as a reductant, V-doped HTOHS resulted in the formation of anatase TiO2 (black) samples and consisted of fewer tubes and more deformed spheres. In this study, fluorescence lifetime (r) of photo-generated carriers corresponded well with the ratio of oxygen vacancy, indicating that oxygen vacancy dominates the lifetime even though it is very sensitive to many factors. The evolution of structure and morphology and photocatalytic mechanism were analysed and discussed.									5	1	0	0	2	0	5			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000447101500059

Their surface density was in the 10(10)-10(11) cm(-2) range. Thermal stability and surface modifications of ND particles were studied by combined use of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and. Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscopy (FEG SEM). Different oxygen-containing functional groups could be identified by XPS and their evolution versus UHV annealing temperature (400-1085 degrees C) could be monitored in situ. The increase of annealing temperature led to a decrease of oxygen bound to carbon. In particular, functional groups where carbon was bound to oxygen via one a bond (C-OH, C-O-C) started decomposing first. At 970 degrees C carbon-oxygen components decreased further. However, the sp(2)/sp(3) carbon ratio did not increase, thus confirming that the graphitization of ND requires higher temperatures. XPS analyses also revealed that no interaction of ND particles with the silicon nitride substrate occurred at temperatures up to about 1000 degrees C. However, at 1050 degrees C silicon nitride coated substrates started showing patch-like damaged areas attributable to interaction of silicon nitride with the underlying substrate. Nevertheless ND particles were preserved in undamaged areas, with surface densities exceeding 10(10) cm(-2). These nanoparticles acted as sp(3)-carbon seeds in a subsequent 15 min Chemical Vapour Deposition run that allowed growing a 60-80 nm diamond film. Our previous study on Si(100) showed that detonation ND particles reacted with silicon between 800 and 900 degrees C and, as a consequence, no diamond film could be grown after Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). These findings demonstrated that the use of a thin silicon nitride buffer layer is preferable insofar as the growth of thin diamond films on silicon devices via nanoseeding is concerned.

The results showed that density and molar volume in the glass system decreased with increasing substitution of CaO for Fe2O3. The variation of glass transition temperature and thermal stability was strictly related to the nature of bonding in the vitreous network. Spectroscopic analysis showed that substitution of CaO for Fe2O3 induced an evolution of structural units from pyrophosphate to metaphosphate species indicating the polymerization of phosphate chains and the decrease of non-bridging oxygen concentrations. With increasing substitution of CaO for Fe2O3 The P-O-Ca linkage and (P-O- Ca2+ O--P) chains participated in the glass network by replacing P-O-Fe bonds. The absorption band of the P-O-Ca stretching mode in the glasses with high CaO content (>= 32 mol%) was assigned at around 1084 cm(-1). The absorption edge would fall in the region between 332 and 420 nm which are the absorption bands of Fe3+ ions.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0973-1458	0974-9845		WOS:000382860800010

The bias potentials typically required for the onset of Oxygen evolution current at the photoanode were sufficient for the efficient reduction of CO2 at the metallic/composite counter electrodes. Using Cu as a cathode electrocatalyst, faradaic efficiencies of 67% for CH4 and 71.6% for all carbon-containing products were achieved. With Sn/SnOx, a combined faradaic efficiency (CO + HCOOH) of 44.3% was obtained at + 0.8 V. The 2-electrode potential between the counter electrode and working electrode for the WO3 driven system was less than the lowest bias potential reported so far for conventional photocathode-driven systems. The results demonstrate for the first time that the intrinsically more stable photoanode-driven systems could accomplish the reduction of CO2 with higher efficiencies relative to the conventional photocathode-driven systems.									65	4	0	0	2	0	66			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000330048400007

The graphitic-poly (2,4,6triaminopyrimidine (g-PTAP) was synthesized by the thermal vapor condensation polymerization (TVCP) method on FTO glass. The structure, morphology, and optical characteristics of the resultant g-PTAP were analyzed using analytical techniques such as FT-IR, Raman, XRD, XPS, CHNS, FE-SEM, EDS, and DRS. The synthesized g-PTAP was graphitic with sheet-like morphology and revealed maximum light absorbance capacity in the visible range. The DFT calculation showed an appropriate HOMO-LUMO band position for overall water splitting which was verified experimentally for H-2 and O-2 generation at photocathode and photoanode, respectively. Moreover, the g-PTAP sample exhibited good photo-stability as a photocathode as compared to a photoanode. This work can provide a pathway for fabricating highly efficient semiconductor photocatalyst for overall water splitting and solar energy such as conversion.

The as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, PL, XPS, and UV vis DRS in detail. The results indicated that the crystal structure and morphology of the samples can be tuned by hydrothermal reaction temperature. The source of nitrogen doping was from dicyandiamide, which also played a key role in hydrolyzing bismuth citrate to produce bismuth ions and citrate ions. The ammonium ions from the decomposition of dicyandiamide reacted with bismuth ions and carbonate ions from decomposition of citrate ions, producing in situ N-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres. The doped nitrogen substituted for oxygen in (BiO)(2)CO3 and was responsible for the band gap reduction of N-doped (BiO)(2)CO3. The as-prepared N-doped (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres were applied for removal of NO in air and exhibited excellent visible light activity, exceeding that of N-doped TiO2 and C-doped TiO2. Time-dependent evolutions of crystal structure, morphology, chemical composition, and optical property were investigated systematically to reveal the growth mechanism of the honeycomb-like (BiO)(2)CO3 microspheres. The growth process involved multiple steps, including reaction, nucleation, crystallization, aggregation, and recrystallization. The proposed growth mechanism could provide new insights into the design and fabrication of hierarchical materials with advanced properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Different reactive etching conditions have been tested for a beam energy of 1 keV with various ion beam and gas atmosphere compositions: pure Ar+, mixture of Ar+ + N-2(+) and Ar+ under a controlled oxygen partial pressure. Their influence on the etching kinetics, roughness and morphology evolutions of the film, crystalline quality have been studied using SEM, AFM and Raman spectroscopy. The optical transmittance has also been measured. The ion beam processes studied result in a drastic reduction of the film surface roughness with a slightly better efficiency for the Ar+ +oxygen gas mixture. The roughness decrease leads to an increase in the optical transmittance without any change in the crystalline quality of the film. This planarizing method should be particularly well-adapted for thicker films taking into account the balance between the initial values of thickness and roughness on the one hand, and the material loss on the other. Furthermore, it could be usefully applied to produce large-area membranes.									18	2	0	0	0	0	21			0925-9635			WOS:A1996UR91000048

The JM-2005-reduced GO sample (JM-2005-rGO) prepared via the epoxide aminolysis reaction in this work were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. All of the above results confirmed that JM-2005 not only covalently bonded to the GO, as a functionalization moiety, but also partly restored the conjugate structure of GO, as a reducing agent. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that JM-2005-rGO sheets were slightly wrinkled and folded on the ultrathin carbon membrane. The well-defined diffraction spots of the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirmed the crystalline structure of JM-2005-rGO. The evolution of surface functionality during reaction made the hydrophilic GO hydrophobic, as evidenced by the good dispersion of JM-2005-rGO in toluene solvent without noticeable precipitation. Furthermore, the various amounts of JM-2005-rGO were added to the epoxy resin, producing the JM-2005-rGO/epoxy nanocomposites. The flame retardancy and thermal stability of JM-2005-rGO/epoxy nanocomposites containing various weight fractions of JM-2005-rGO were investigated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI) test and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in nitrogen. Significant increases in the char yield and LOI were achieved with the addition of 10 wt% JM-2005-rGO in epoxy, giving improvements of 137% and 30%, respectively. This report demonstrates a cost-effective approach to construct the functionalized graphene/epoxy nanocomposites, with reinforced properties and indicates further application in research and industrial areas.									1	2	0	0	0	0	3			1000-3304			WOS:000366246800015

The largest specific area (99.82 m(2)g(-1)) of the catalyst was confirmed via a nitrogen adsorption isotherm. Furthermore, the uniform coating of the Mn3O4-Co3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of the MWCNTs was observed via scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy; the uniform coating provided an effective transport pathway during the electrocatalytic activities. The rotating disk electrode and rotating ring disk electrode measurements indicated that the electron transfer number was 3.96 and the evolution of H2O2 was 2%. In addition, the Mn3O4-Co3O4/MWCNT catalyst did not undergo urea poisoning and remained stable in an alkaline solution. Conversely, commercial Pt/C could not withstand urea poisoning for long. The performance cell achieved a power density of 0.4226 mW cm(-2) at 50 degrees C. Therefore, Mn3O4-Co3O4/MWCNT is an efficient and inexpensive noble-metal-free cathodic catalyst for direct urea fuel cells.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10				1996-1073		WOS:000535739300200

Current attention is mostly focused on tin-based materials, which, unfortunately, often suffer from limited Faradaic efficiency. The potential of bismuth in carbon dioxide reduction has been suggested but remained understudied. Here, we report that ultrathin bismuth nanosheets are prepared from the in situ topotactic transformation of bismuth oxyiodide nanosheets. They process single crystallinity and enlarged surface areas. Such an advantageous nanostructure affords the material with excellent electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide reduction to formate. High selectivity (similar to 100%) and large current density are measured over a broad potential, as well as excellent durability for >10 h. Its selectivity for formate is also understood by density functional theory calculations. In addition, bismuth nanosheets were coupled with an iridium-based oxygen evolution electrocatalyst to achieve efficient full-cell electrolysis. When powered by two AA-size alkaline batteries, the full cell exhibits impressive Faradaic efficiency and electricity-to-formate conversion efficiency.									482	36	0	0	35	0	487			2041-1723			WOS:000429004500013	29615621

Herein, a facile potentiodynamic electrochemical deposition method is developed for the synthesis of NIS/Ni(OH)(2) and iron-incorporated NiS/Ni(OH)(2) composites as auspicious electrocatalysts for HER from water in a neutral medium. However, the NiS/Ni(OH)(2) composite shows low electrocatalytic performance, the modification with iron significantly enhances its electrocatalytic HER activity. The coexistence of NIS and Ni(OH)(2) together with the iron is crucial for lowering the overpotential for the HER. For instance, the iron-incorporated NiS/Ni(OH)(2) electrocatalyst requires an overpotential of 196 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2), while the NiS/Ni(OH)(2) and iron-incorporated Ni(OH)(2) require an overpotential of 350 mV and 560 mV to deliver 10 and 5.0 mA cm(-2), respectively. The synergy between NiS and Ni(OH)(2) generates optimum free energy for the adsorption of hydrogen intermediate. While the incorporation of iron into the NiS/Ni(OH)(2) composite enhances the intrinsic HER electrocatalytic performance, increases the electrochemical surface area, and reduces the interfacial charge transfer resistance.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000488300200008

Chroneos, Alex/0000-0002-2558-495X			Defect engineering of the oxygen-vacancy clusters formation in electron irradiated silicon by isovalent doping: An infrared perspective								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				112	12					123517	10.1063/1.4770488				DEC 15 2012	2012	Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the production and evolution of oxygen-vacancy (VOn for n = 1, 2, 3 and VmO for m = 1, 2, 3) clusters, in electron-irradiated Czochralski silicon (Cz-Si) samples, doped with isovalent dopants. It was determined that the production of the VO pair is enhanced in Ge-doped Si but is suppressed in Sn and Pb-doped Si. The phenomenon is discussed in terms of the competition between isovalent dopants and oxygen atoms in capturing vacancies in the course of irradiation. In the case of Ge, only transient GeV pairs form, leading finally to an increase of the VO production. Conversely, for Sn and Pb the corresponding pairs with vacancies are stable, having an opposite impact on the formation of VO pairs. Regarding V2O and V3O clusters, our measurements indicate that Ge doping enhances their formation, although Sn and Pb dopants suppress it. Similar arguments as those for the VO pair could be put forward, based on the effect of isovalent impurities on the availability of vacancies. Additionally, it was found that the conversion ratio of VO to VO2 decreases as the covalent radius of the isovalent dopant increases. These results are discussed in terms of the local strains introduced by the isovalent dopants in the Si lattice. These local strains affect the balance of the intrinsic defects created as a result of irradiation, as well as the balance between the two main reactions (VO + O-i -> VO2 and VO + Si-I -> O-i) participating in the VO annealing, leading finally to a decrease of the VO2 production. The larger the covalent radius of the isovalent dopant (r(Ge) < r(Sn) < r(Pb)), the larger the introduced strains in the lattice and then the less the VO2 formation in accordance with our experimental results. Interestingly, an opposite trend was observed for the conversion ratio of VO2 to VO3. The phenomenon is attributed to the enhanced diffusivity of oxygen impurity as a result of the presence of isovalent dopants, leading to an enhanced formation of the VO3 cluster. The results indicate that isovalent doping of Si is an effective way to control the formation of the deleterious oxygen-vacancy clustering that can affect Si-based devices.

Thus, it is of fundamental importance to investigate their states and possible reactions under the planetary conditions. Here, using advanced crystal structure searches and first-principles calculations in the Si-O-H system, we find that a silica-water compound (SiO2)2(H2O) anda silica-hydrogen compound SiO2H2 can exist under high pressures above 450 and 650 GPa, respectively. Further simulations reveal that, at high pressure and high temperature conditions corresponding to the interiors of Uranus and Neptune, these compounds exhibit superionic behavior, in which protons diffuse freely like liquid while the silicon and oxygen framework is fixed as solid. Therefore, these superionic silica-water and silica-hydrogen compounds could be regarded as important components of the deep mantle or core of giants, which also provides an alternative origin for their anomalous magnetic fields. These unexpected physical and chemical properties of the most common natural materials at high pressure offer key clues to understand some abstruse issues including demixing and erosion of the core in giant planets, and shed light on building reliable models for solar giants and exoplanets.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000747746100007	35119900

Here, a three-dimensional interconnected porous carbon nanofiber (PCNF) membrane has been developed and utilized as a support for active cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanoparticles. This rationally designed self-supported HER catalyst has a lotus root-like multichannel structure, which provides several intrinsic advantages over conventional CNFs. The longitudinal channels can store the electrolyte and ensure fast ion and mass transport within the catalysts. Additionally, mesopores on the outer and inner carbon walls enhance ion and mass migration of the electrolyte to HER active CoP nanoparticles, thus shortening the ion transport distance and increasing the contact area between the electrolyte and the CoP nanoparticles. Moreover, the conductive carbon substrate provides fast electron transfer pathways by forming an integrated conductive network, which further ensures fast HER kinetics. As a result, the CoP/PCNF composites exhibit low onset-potentials (-20, -91, and -84 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4, 1 M PBS, and 1 M KOH, respectively). These findings show that CoP/PCNF composites are promising self-supporting and high-performance all-pH range HER catalysts.									38	3	0	0	0	0	38			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000424049300009

In order to study the role of Al atoms, the properties of Al atoms located in the calcium silicate sheet and the interlayer region have been investigated. The Si-Al substitution in the calcium silicate sheet has not changed the layered structure of the C-A-S-H gel. On the other hand, the presence of Al atoms in the interlayer region improves the structure and mechanical performance significantly. The connectivity factor, Q, species evolution indicates that the aluminate species in the interlayer region play an essential role in bridging the defective silicate chains and transforming the layered C-A-S-H gel at low Al/Ca levels to the branch network structure at high Al/Ca levels. The structural transition is partly attributed to the aluminate-silicate connection by the NBO sites and is partly caused by the polymerization reaction between the aluminate species, both of which can be described by the reactive force field. Additionally, the polymerization reaction by the aluminate species also leads to a hydrolytic reaction. In this way, a lot of water molecules are transformed to hydroxyls, even bridging oxygen atoms. Dynamically, due to the high strength of the Al-O bond, the aluminate-silicate network in the C-A-S-H gel has a better stability at higher Al/Ca ratios. Furthermore, uniaxial tension tests on the C-A-S-H gels demonstrate the mechanical behavior and large structural deformation of the gel. Both the Young's modulus and tensile strength are improved significantly with increasing aluminum content, indicating a good loading resistance ability in the aluminate-silicate network. The tensile deformation, simulated by the reactive force field, is also coupled with depolymerization of the aluminate species and the water dissociation reaction, which shows good plasticity due to the Al atom addition.									51	3	0	0	0	0	54				2046-2069		WOS:000345924600055

Various analyses such as phenol concentration, TOC, COD, cyclic voltammetry, and total current efficiency were conducted to determine the performance of phenol degradation in the presence of Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. The phenol and COD removal rate were relatively higher at lower pH conditions (pH 3 and 5) due to high oxidant generation of OH radical and H2O2. At pH 5 condition, phenol (90 mg L-1) was completely removed after a 24-h operation. However, complete COD removal was obtained after about 250-h operation, due to byproduct formations (hydroquinone and polymers) during the phenol degradation. Cyclic voltammetry analysis indicated that acidic conditions could inhibit the oxygen-evolution reaction, causing an increase in current efficiency and a decrease in energy consumption. This study suggests that phenol-contaminated wastewater can be efficiently treated by an electrochemical process using a Pt/Ti electrode with continuously controlled lower pH conditions.Phenol oxidation by electrochemical treatment system at different pH conditions Electrochemical reactor (inside) R: reference electrode, A: Pt/Ti anode, C: Ti cathode, G: pipe to the gas bag, S: sample holder, M: magnetic stirrer									10	0	0	0	3	0	10			0959-3330	1479-487X		WOS:000481211600001	31390950

Various strategies and catalytic materials have been explored in order to improve the efficiency of the water splitting reaction. Although significant progress has been made, there are many intriguing fundamental phenomena that need to be understood. Herein, we review recent experimental efforts to demonstrate enhancement strategies for efficient solar water splitting, especially for the light absorption, charge carrier separation, and water oxidation kinetics. We also focus on the state of the art of photoelectrochemical (PEC) device designs such as application of facet engineering and the development of a ferroelectric-coupled PEC device. Based on these experimental achievements, future challenges, and directions in solar water splitting technology will be discussed.									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			2076-3417			WOS:000442864900178

Ni(3)S(2)catalysts have been widely regarded as promising candidates, but suffer from unfavorable hydrogen adsorption characteristics; hydrogen absorption on the Ni sites is not sufficiently strong. Herein, by usingab initiocalculations, we have shown that hydrogen adsorption on Ni sites of Ni(3)S(2)catalysts can be tuned by introducing sulfur vacancies. Inspired by this theoretical finding, we have fabricated a porous Ni(3)S(2)nanosheet array catalyst grown on nickel foam that is rich in sulfur vacancies (Vs-Ni3S2/NF) by a plasma-assisted method. The catalyst exhibits a much improved HER activity, which only requires a low overpotential of 88 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1)in 1 M KOH. This catalyst also shows high durability, which can sustain 15 h of high-current-density (similar to 100 mA cm(-2)) operation with negligible degradation. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that the increase in the electron density of Ni sites induced by sulfur vacancies plays a key role in improving its intrinsic activity. This work opens a new direction for the rational design of highly efficient transition-metal-compound electrocatalysts toward HER and beyond through defect engineering.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000569873400029

Their catalytic performance was evaluated in the steam reforming of acetic acid and the effects of CTAB concentration on the porous structures, reducibilities, morphology, and activity of catalysts were studied. The catalysts were characterized by BET, XRD, H-2-TPR, XPS, HRTEM, insitu DRIFTS, DTG, FTIR, and temperature-programmed reaction to elucidate the structure-activity relationship of the catalyst. The results showed that owing to the CTAB assistance, a high surface area of ceria could be achieved, which induced a better Ni dispersion with a smaller Ni size, strengthened the interaction between Ni and CeO2, and promoted the reducibility of Ni, obtaining higher activity and lower methane yield than Ni/Ce. Among these prepared samples, Ni/Ce-C6 showed the highest surface area and the best catalytic performance with a hydrogen yield of up to 82.5% even at a low temperature (550 degrees C). Owing to the stronger Ni-ceria interaction of Ni/Ce-C6, the lattice oxygen in ceria migrates easily to the Ni surface, interacts with the reaction intermediates, and thus improves the CO2/CO ratio in the products. Much more CO and CO2 and less CH4 were observed over Ni/Ce-C6 during the temperature-programmed reaction, indicating its high activity. In-situ DRFITS characterization demonstrated that the two types of catalysts had similar reaction intermediates but various adsorption and conversion abilities toward the acetic acid. More reaction intermediates were adsorbed at low temperatures and a higher conversion was obtained over Ni/Ce-C6 owing to its better Ni dispersion. The CTAB assistance inhibited the formation of amorphous carbon but facilitated the formation of graphitic carbon at similar to 637 degrees C which did not induce catalyst deactivation.

Within the crustaceans, this copper-containing protein was thought to be restricted to Malacostraca, while other crustacean classes were assumed to employ hemoglobin or lack any respiratory protein. Only recently it has become evident that hemocyanins also occur in Remipedia and Ostracoda. Here we report for the first time the identification and characterisation of hemocyanin in the fish louse Argulus, which belongs to the class of Branchiura. This finding indicates that hemocyanin was the principal oxygen carrier in the stem lineage of the pancrustaceans, but has been lost independently multiple times in crustacean taxa. We obtained the full-length cDNA sequences of two hemocyanin subunits of Argulus foliaceus by a combination of RT-PCR, RACE and Illumina sequencing of the transcriptome. In addition, one full-length and one partial cDNA sequence were derived from the transcriptome data of Argulus siamensis. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of at least two hemocyanin subunits in A. foliaceus, which are expressed at the mRNA level at a 1:3.5 ratio. The addition to the branchiuran hemocyanin subunits to a multiple sequence alignment of arthropod, hemocyanins improved the phylogenetic resolution within the pancrustacean hemocyanins. Malacostracan, ostracod and branchiuran hemocyanins are distinct from the hexapod and remipede hemocyanins, reinforcing the hypothesis of a close relationship of Remipedia and Hexapoda. Notably, the ostracod hemocyanins are paraphyletic with respect to the branchiuran hemocyanins, indicating ancient divergence and differential loss of distinct subunit types.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000368642800002	26515963

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that a single Ru atom was supported on a wide range of natural nanoporous carbon materials, including C2N, triazine-C3N4, (T-C3N4), and gamma-graphene. These carbon materials belong to a new generation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) and are named Ru-1@C2N, Ru-1@T-C3N4, and Ru-1@gamma-graphyne, respectively. Ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations show that a single Ru atom can be stably anchored in the nanopores of these carbon materials with strong cohesive energy. Compared with parallel adsorption configuration, the vertical adsorption configuration of N-2 exhibits higher adsorption energy. The calculated Gibbs free energy reveals N-2 reduction on the three catalysts via associative mechanisms. Despite the similar limiting potentials (-0.96, -0.94, and -0.98 V on Ru-1@C2N, Ru-1@T-C3N4, and Ru-1@gamma-graphynes, respectively), the limiting step differs, indicating the significant effects of carbon material substrates on electrochemical NRR. However, the competitive and efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) changes the potential determining step and increases the overpotential for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction (NRR). This study provides insights for experimental synthesis of electrocatalysts for N-2 reduction.									86	6	0	0	0	0	85				2513-0390		WOS:000451888600003

In principle, hydrogen sulfide splitting can be used to treat hydrogen sulfide in natural and process gases and simultaneously to produce hydrogen using solar energy. A comparison with conventional water splitting demonstrated the lower energy requirements to achieve the same photocurrent densities, while producing soluble polysulfide ions and elemental sulfur from hydrogen sulfide oxidation. However, neither splitting process was spontaneous using SnIV-doped alpha-Fe2O3 photo-anodes without inputs of electrical energy; two judiciously chosen photo-electrodes are required to achieve that objective. The effects were also studied of stirring, hydrogen sulfide ion concentration, electrode potential and annealing of SnIV-doped a-Fe2O3 films on titanium substrates. Under potentiostatic conditions during photo-assisted electrolysis, the photo-anodes exhibited no compositional or morphological changes after 18 h. In a bench-scale reactor (0.1 dm(3)), stable photocurrent densities of ca. 12.5 A m(-2) were recorded over 12 h at an electrode potential of 1.17 V vs. RHE and an effective irradiance of 2670 W m(-2). Similarly, photocurrent densities corresponding to ca. 4.3 A m(-2) were achieved in an up-scaled reactor under an effective irradiance of 457 W m(-2). Charge yields for formation of polysulfide ions were close to unity when operating at optimised potentials and hydrogen sulfide ion concentrations. The shift towards lower electrode potentials of photocurrent densities for hydrogen sulfide splitting compared with those for water splitting was associated with increased charge transfer rates due to decreased interfacial electron-hole recombination rates. The potential dependences of sulfur coverage and oxygen evolution rates were also estimated. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we present a general descriptor-based strategy for the rational design of SACsviadensity functional theory calculations. Taking the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) as an example, we firstly revealed the scaling relations for adsorption energies of intermediates on a series of 4-B (MB4), 4-C (MC4) and 4-N (MN4) coordinated SACs. Based on this, the activity of the NRR was described by the adsorption free energy of *NH. It's found that MB4, MC(4)and MN(4)followed the same volcano curve of activity, where FeB(4)was optimal with a limiting potential of -0.55 V. On MB4, the H adsorption energies were weaker than on widely studied MC(4)and MN(4)due to the highly occupied H 1s-d antibonding state, which resulted in a higher NRR selectivity of MB4. More strikingly, kinetic calculations suggested that the activation energy of the NRR (0.99 eV) is lower than that of the HER (1.10 eV) on FeB(4)at 0 Vvs.RHE, and hence the ammonia production should be more feasible than hydrogen evolution on FeB4. This work not only reported MB(4)as a potential NRR electrocatalyst, where FeB(4)was the most outstanding, but also generalized the descriptor-based approach to the rational design of widely studied SACs.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000562931300025

Sulphur deprivation of C. reinhardtii also triggers a complex metabolic response resulting in the induction of various stress-related genes, down-regulation of photosynthesis, the establishment of anaerobiosis and expression of active hydrogenase. Photosystem II (PSII) plays dual role in H-2 production because it supplies electrons but the evolved O-2 inhibits the hydrogenase. Here, we show that upon sulphur deprivation, the ascorbate content in C. reinhardtii increases about 50-fold, reaching the mM range; at this concentration, ascorbate inactivates the Mn-cluster of PSII, and afterwards, it can donate electrons to tyrozin Z(+) at a slow rate. This stage is followed by donor-side-induced photoinhibition, leading to the loss of charge separation activity in PSII and reaction centre degradation. The time point at which maximum ascorbate concentration is reached in the cell is critical for the establishment of anaerobiosis and initiation of H-2 production. We also show that ascorbate influenced H-2 evolution via altering the photosynthetic electron transport rather than hydrogenase activity and starch degradation.									21	0	0	0	17	0	22			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000381496900007	26714836

J	CHEN, L; FINCHER, GB; HOJ, PB				Hoj, Peter B/E-8526-2011				EVOLUTION OF POLYSACCHARIDE HYDROLASE SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY - CATALYTIC AMINO-ACIDS ARE CONSERVED IN BARLEY 1,3-1,4-GLUCANASE AND 1,3-BETA-GLUCANASE								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				268	18			13318	13326						JUN 25 1993	1993	Catalytic amino acid residues in a 1,3-beta-D-glucan 3-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) and a homologous 1,3-4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.73) from barley have been investigated. To identify amino acids responsible for protonation of the glycosidic oxygen during hydrolysis, carbodiimide-mediated labeling of the enzymes with [C-14]glycine ethyl ester was performed. This resulted in loss of activity and specific modification of the Glu288 residues in both enzymes. The stoichiometry of labeling was approximately 1:1, and modification was reduced in the presence of substrate analogues. Based on these data, the Glu288 residues are likely to be present at the active sites of the respective enzymes and may represent the catalytic acids in the hydrolytic reaction. The catalytic nucleophiles of the two enzymes were investigated by labeling with specific, mechanism-based epoxyalkyl-beta-oligoglucosides. Amino acid residues Glu232 and Glu231 were identified as the likely catalytic nucleophiles in the 1,3-1,4- and 1,3-beta-glucanases, respectively. Thus the position of the catalytic nucleophile and the putative proton donating amino acids in the two classes of beta-glucan endohydrolases are conserved. The acquisition of distinct substrate specificities in the evolution of these related enzymes may therefore not require the recruitment of novel catalytic amino acids but rather differences in their positioning at the active site and/or changes in substrate binding residues.									76	0	0	0	70	0	77			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1993LH55300046	8514770

The effects of the Co amount (x), in terms of the Co content over the total amounts of Co and Ni presented in (CoxNi1-x)Se-2/C (x-0, 0.25, a33, 0.50, 0.67, 0.75 and 1.0), on the crystal structures, surface morphologies, microstructures, electrocatalytic activities and stabilities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) were systematically investigated. It was found that the incorporation of Co into NiSe,/C apparently reduced the average crystallite sizes of the as-prepared (CoxNi1-x) Se-2/C (0 < x < 1.0) ternary catalysts by forming the solid solution like structure composing of NiSe2 and CoSe2. The average crystallite sizes decreased from 32.1 nm to 20.6 nm by varying x from 0 to 1.0. A typical cubic (CoxNi1-x) Se-2 (0 <= x < 1.0) single crystallite with pyramidal morphology was identified, which differed significantly from the predominant orthogonal CoSe2 polycrystallite at x = 1.0. The potentials corresponding to ORR (E-ORR) were 0.50 similar to 0.68 V with the electron transfer numbers of 2.1 similar to 3.6 at 0.3 V in 0.1 mol L-1 HClO4 solutions. The enhanced ORR activities were observed with Co-rich (CoxNi1-x) Se-2/C catalysts (x>0.5), in particular, with (Co0.75Ni0.25) Se-2/C which showed no loss in after 1000 cycles. The excessive amount of Co introduced into NiSe2/C resulted in the coexistence of a cubic (CoxNi1-x) Se-2 single crystallite and an orthogonal CoSe2 polycrystallite, which might be beneficial to inhibit the grain growth and to provide more active sites. Furthermore, the formation of (CoxNi1-x) Se-2 might provide more stable structure for the ternary (Co0.75Ni0.25) Se-2/C to impede the Se oxidation.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			2196-0216			WOS:000438339200034

Relative to a traditional planar electrode configuration, the flow-through configuration allowed efficient removal of the hydrogen bubbles from the catalyst surface, especially at high operating current densities, and significantly decreased the overpotentials required for HER. An analytical model that accounted for the electrokinetics of HER as well as the mass transport with or without the flow-through configuration was developed to quantitatively evaluate voltage losses associated with kinetic overpotentials and ohmic resistance due to bubble formation in the porous electrodes. The chemical composition, electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and roughness factor (RF) were also systematically studied to assess the electrocatalytic performance of the 3D printed, hierarchically porous NiMo electrodes. An ECSA of 25163 cm(2) was obtained with the highly porous structures, and an average overpotential of 45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved over 24 h by using the flow-through configuration. The flow-through configuration evaluated in the simple H-cell achieved high electrochemical accessible surface areas for electrochemical reactions and provided useful information for adaption of the porous electrodes in flow cells.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000648552500068	33886258

However, despite various coupled oxygen-evolution-reaction (OER) cocatalysts, it commonly exhibits a much smaller photocurrent (<similar to 1 mA cm(-2)) than the expected value (8 mA cm(-2)) from its band gap under AM1.5G 100 mW cm(-2) illumination. Here, we show that a short carrier diffusion length with respect to the large light penetration depth in 3C-SiC significantly limits the charge separation, thus resulting in a small photocurrent. To overcome this drawback, this work demonstrates a facile anodization method to fabricate nanoporous 3C-SiC photoanodes coupled with Ni:FeOOH cocatalyst that evidently improve the solar water splitting performance. The optimized nanoporous 3C-SiC shows a high photocurrent density of 2.30 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) under AM1.5G 100 mW cm(-2) illumination, which is 3.3 times higher than that of its planar counterpart (0.69 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE). We further demonstrate that the optimized nanoporous photoanode exhibits an enhanced light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) of over 93%, a high charge-separation efficiency (Phi(sep)) of 38%, and a high charge-injection efficiency (Phi(ox)) of 91% for water oxidation at 1.23 V-RHE, which are significantly outperforming those its planar counterpart (LHE = 78%, Phi(sep) = 28%, and Phi(ox) = 53% at 1.23 V-RHE). All of these properties of nanoporous 3C-SiC enable a synergetic enhancement of solar water splitting performance. This work also brings insights into the design of other indirect band gap semiconductors for solar energy conversion.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000634569100157	33605135

It is of significance yet challenging to design and construct effective HER electrocatalysts of an acceptable cost. In this study, a highly efficient metal-organic framework (MOF)-based electrochemical HER system based on NiRu-based binary MOF (Ru-doped Ni-2(BDC)(2)TED MOF, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid; TED = triethylenediamine) nanosheets grown on conductive substrates (e.g., Ni foam, carbon cloth) is fabricated by a facile solvothermal method. The resultant NiRu-MOF-based composites possess enhanced electron transport ability and water stability, accompanied by increased electrochemically active areas and hydrophilic/aerophobic properties. With these advantages, the optimized NiRu-MOF nanosheet arrays on Ni foam substrate (NiRu-MOF/NF) with a Ru/Ni molar ratio of 6/94 in the MOF structure could exhibit efficient catalytic performance for HER in alkaline conditions, requiring a small overpotential of 51 mV at -10 mA cm(-2). This study could provide a feasible way for the design and synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) MOF-based materials with controllable interface properties for energy catalysis and beyond.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000558792700022	32643917

The formation of a Ag/Pt alloy phase was confirmed by XRD and HRTEM. Elemental mapping and line scanning revealed the formation of the hollow architecture. We studied the effects of the Ag/Pt ratio, surfactant and reaction temperature on the morphology. In addition, we explored the formation process of hollow dendritic Ag/Pt nanoparticles by tracking the morphologies of the nanostructures formed at different stages. In order to improve the electrocatalytic property, we controlled the size of the nanoparticles and the thickness of the shell by adjusting the amount of the precursor. We found that these Ag/Pt alloy nanoparticles exhibited high activity (440 mA mg(-1)) and stability as an electrocatalyst for catalyzing methanol oxidation.									25	1	0	0	2	0	26			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000415577600044	29091089

In HMFOR, the intrinsic catalytic activity and charge transfer mechanisms are crucial. Herein, nickel, co-deposited with phosphorus (Ni-P), attains superior electrocatalytic performance compared with Ni and its oxyhydroxides for the HMFOR. Such electrocatalytic activity of the Ni-P catalyst is attributed to the high oxidation state of surface Ni species, supported by the bulk Ni-P component. An unprecedented charge storing capacity enabled by the bulk Ni-P material maintains the spontaneous reaction between HMF and Ni3+ species to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) normalized by the electrochemical active surface area at a low potential of 1.42 V vs RHE, reaching a 97% Faradaic efficiency toward 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid.

Herein, we report a novel Ni3S2 nanorod array decorated with (020)-oriented VS4 nanocrystals grown on nickel foam (S-hig-NS-rod/NF) via a simple and facile solvothermal method. Results show that the in situ incorporation of VS4 not only triggers the formation of such a nanorod array structure, but also contributes to the uniform grafting of high-density and high catalytically active bridging S-2(2-) sites on the interface between Ni3S2 and VS4 for enhanced HER activity, and also promotes the absorption ability of OH- radicals and thus accelerates the HER Volmer step in alkaline media. As expected, the resultant S-hig-NS-rod/NF material exhibits impressive catalytic performance toward the HER, with a much lower overpotential of 137 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a long-term durability for at least 22 h, and is superior to Ni3S2 nanorod arrays with low-density bridging S-2(2-) (S-low-NS-rod/NF) and NS-film/NF counterparts (without VS4), even outperforming the NF-supported 20% Pt/C at a large current density of over 120 mA cm(-2). Our findings put forward fresh insight into the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts toward the HER for green hydrogen fuel production.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000509545700079	31912846

Thereby, the stability of intermediates and activation barriers of the various reaction pathways depend critically on specific properties of the substrate materials. Deposition of ultrathin metal layers represents an established means to tune these in a controlled way. In the present study, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption have been employed to study the thermal evolution of adsorbed methanol on Ru(0001) precovered by Cu. While the full Cu monolayer turns out to be inert in the absence of coadsorbates such as oxygen, various reaction intermediates are discernible for Theta(Cu) < 1 ML. In the temperature range 220-300 K, two upright methoxy species (local C-3 nu symmetry) on uncovered Ru(0001) areas and on Cu/Ru(0001) can be distinguished. The local methoxy coverage on the Cu monolayer amounts to about 0.04 ML which is half the value found on Ru(0001). This value gradually reduces to zero for Cu coverages exceeding 0.75 ML, i.e., approaching the full Cu monolayer. Interestingly, passivation of the Ru(0001) step edges by minute amounts of Cu or Pt effectively delays decomposition of Ru-bound methoxy. Specifically, the thermal stability of methoxy on uncovered Ru(0001) increases from 220 K for clean Ru(0001) to about 300 K for a partially filled Cu/Ru or Pt/Ru layer. The thermal stability of Cu-bound methoxy is even higher, and at least 380 K is required to transform all methoxy molecules into CO and hydrogen. Our study dearly shows that a modification of the reaction kinetics on a catalytically active surface can be achieved even for minute amounts of deposited metal atoms, e.g., by passivation of various types of reaction centers. For extended monolayer films, strain and electronic effects due to the underlying substrate strongly affect stability of intermediate species, as well as their formation and decomposition kinetics.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000286868600076

This electrode architecture consists of four levels of interconnected hierarchy: a primary macroporous Ni foam scaffold (>= 500 mm), an intermediate vertically-aligned MnCo2O4 core-nanoflake array (50-100 nm), topmost ultra-thin MnO2 nanosheets (similar to 10 nm) and short-range ordered mesopores (similar to 5 nm) on the MnO2 nanosheets. This freestanding, hierarchical porous electrode has advantages in enhancing electroactive surface area, enabling efficient mass transport through the porous structure. The heterostructured electrode exhibits a low onset potential (1.33 V vs. RHE), a high anodic peak current density (1000 mA cm(-2) g(-1) at 1.7 V vs. RHE) and long-term catalytic stability for urea oxidation, which surpasses previous reported electrode materials for urea electrolysis. Remarkably, the MnO2/MnCo2O4/Ni electrode possesses bifunctional catalytic activity for both urea oxidation and hydrogen evolution. A urea electrolytic cell with both anode and cathode using the heterostructured electrodes has been fabricated and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) has been achieved at a cell voltage of 1.55 V.

Noble metal-based catalysts have been extensively studied for decades; however, activity and durability issues still remain a challenge. In recent years, carbon shell-encapsulated metal (M@C) catalysts have drawn great attention as novel materials for water electrolysis and fuel cell applications. These electrochemical reactions are governed mainly by interfacial charge transfer between the core metal and the outer carbon shell, which alters the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. Furthermore, the rationally designed and fine-tuned carbon shell plays a very interesting role as a protective layer or molecular sieve layer to improve the performance and durability of energy conversion systems.

However, research in this area is still sparse, with majority of the researches being conducted on the synthesis of alumina/silica-based nanomaterials such as zeolite from fly ash. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of high-purity, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) nanosheet from a brown coal fly ash (BCFA) waste via leaching, precipitation and ethanol-mediated hydrothermal processing in sequence. The resultant nanosheet from fly ash bears a specific surface area of around 100 m2/g, and an averaged aspect ratio of 11.8, as opposed to only 1.5 for the commercial Mg(OH)2 and the one synthesed without the mediation of ethanol during hydrothermal processing. The fly ash derived Mg(OH)2 nanosheet was subsequently loaded with 30 wt% Fe3+ (as Fe2O3) via incipient wetness impregnation and calcined into a (111) facet-rich MgO, which was proved for a superior catalysis performance for high-temperature water gas shift reaction (HT-WGSR). At the reaction temperatures of 400-450 ?C, the CO conversion was increased by a factor of two compared to a reference catalyst consisting of identical Fe loading on the Mg(OH)2 support synthesized without ethanol, and by a factor of seven compared to a nano-sized hematite catalyst synthesized from same hydrothermal process without ethanol addition. This is mainly due to the abundant oxygen vacancy on the (111) facet of the MgO nanosheet support, which improved the reducibility of Fe3+ as well as facilitated the formation and decomposition of intermediate formates that in turn promoted the forward reaction. This study is expected to open a new direction for the valorisation of fly ash and any Mg-bearing solid wastes into high-value materials such as catalyst or catalyst support for a broad range of catalytic applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0926-860X	1873-3875		WOS:000646252300003

However, the CTFs need to be combined with noble-metal-cocatalysts to achieve photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we reported the noble-metal-free Ni2P/CTF composites as an efficient catalyst for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. With increasing the Ni2P alloy loading on the surface of CTF, the photo catalytic activity increases obviously and then decreases gradually, and the highest photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate is achieved for 2.8%Ni2P/CTF, which is almost the same as that of 3.0%Pt/CTF photocatalyst. It has been revealed that the Ni2P alloy act as a cocatalyst for effectively suppressing the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes, promoting the separation and migration of the charge carriers, thereby improving the efficiency of photocatalytic H-2 evolution. This work provides a promising strategy for preparation of cheap and stable photocatalytic system based on CTF for efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under visible-light irradiation.

J	Najafpour, Mohammad Mahdi								An approach for catalyst design in artificial photosynthetic systems: focus on nanosized inorganic cores within proteins								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				117	1-3	SI		197	205		10.1007/s11120-012-9792-z				NOV 2013	2013	Some enzymes can be considered as a catalyst having a nanosized inorganic core in a protein matrix. In some cases, the metal oxide or sulfide clusters, which can be considered as cofactors in enzymes, may be recruited for use in other related reactions in artificial photosynthetic systems. In other words, one approach to design efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts in artificial photosynthetic systems for the purpose of utilizing sunlight to generate high energy intermediates or useful material is to select and utilize inorganic cores of enzymes. For example, one of the most important goals in developing artificial photosynthesis is hydrogen production. However, first, it is necessary to find a "super catalyst" for water oxidation, which is the most challenging half reaction of water splitting. There is an efficient system for water oxidation in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. Published data on the Mn-Ca cluster have provided details on the mechanism and structure of the water oxidizing complex as a Mn-Ca nanosized inorganic core in photosystem II. Progress has been made in introducing Mn-Ca oxides as efficient catalysts for water oxidation in artificial photosynthetic systems. Here, in the interest of designing efficient catalysts for other important reactions in artificial photosynthesis, a few examples of our knowledge of inorganic cores of proteins, and how Nature used them for important reactions, are discussed.									8	0	0	0	3	0	8			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000326604900013	23377954

Although a number of studies on the hydrodynamic behaviours of the CLC process in fuel reactor have been documented in the open literature, there have been rare studies on the correlation between the bubble formation and the local particulate volume fraction. This paper aims to investigate the CLC process in a fuel reactor using the CFD modelling, coupled with the heterogeneous reactions, the hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics occurring in the fuel reactor. A parameter correlating the occurrence of bubble and dynamic properties is proposed. The parameter may be acted as an indicator of time-dependent bubble evolution with a potential to be adopted in the CLC for controlling the bubbling phenomena since the occurrence of the bubbles at specific positions is highly correlated with the local large eddies embedded in the flow. The results obtained clearly indicate that the CFD model developed in the current study reasonably forecasts the hydrodynamic behaviours and important phenomena observed in the fuel reactor.

MoS2 nanotubes (1D), nanoflakes (2D) and quantum dots (0D, QDs) were used, respectively, as co-catalysts of PCN in photocatalytic water splitting reaction to evolve hydrogen. Although, 2D-PCN showed the highest light absorption in visible range and the most enhanced photocurrent response after irradiation with light from 460 to 727 nm, QDs-PCN showed the highest photocatalytic efficiency. The detailed analysis revealed that the superior photocatalytic activity of QDs-PCN in comparison with other structures of MoS2 arose from (i) the most effective separation of photoexcited electron-hole pairs, (ii) the most enhanced up-converted photoluminescence (UCPL), (iii) the highest reactivity of electrons in conduction band. Moreover, a narrowed size of QDs affected shorter diffusion path of charge carriers to active reaction sites, higher number of the sites and higher interfacial area between molybdenum disulfide and PCN.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000659269500001	34034236

The goals of this study are to further disentangle stellar sources of the O-18-enriched (Group IV) and the most O-17-enriched (Group I) silicate grains and to put further constraints on the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of the Si isotopes. Our results show that the majority (6 out of 8) of the O-18 enriched silicates have enhanced Si-28, in qualitative agreement with the signature of presolar silicon carbide (SiC) X grains from supernovae. Three highly 17O-enriched grains (O-17/O-16 > 3 x 10(-3)) have close to solar Si-29/Si-28 but enhanced Si-30/Si-28, possibly indicating an origin in binary systems. Alternative stellar sources are 3.5-4 M-circle dot asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Si isotopic compositions of the majority of presolar silicates fall along the SiC mainstream line, although most grains plot to the Si-30-poor side of this line. Most presolar silicate grains therefore formed in red giant branch (RGB)/AGB stars of roughly solar metallicity, and incorporated less (or no) Si processed by slow neutron capture reactions ("s-process") than presolar SiC grains, because silicates form before large amounts of C-12 and s-processed material has been dredged up to the surface. The inferred shift of the Si isotopes due to the different dredge-up of matter from the He intershell in C-rich AGB stars is Delta Si-29 = 3 parts per thousand-2 parts per thousand and Delta Si-30 = 17 parts per thousand-30 parts per thousand, which is compatible with predictions for 1.5-3 M-circle dot AGB stars of solar metallicity when C/O > 1.									42	0	0	0	1	0	42			0004-637X			WOS:000258730700044

The constant coefficient nonlinear equations are solved by using the Quasi-steady-state approximation method. The electron lifetimes are obtained for afterglow plasma with different initial values, and the temporal evolutions of the main charged species are presented, which are dominant in reaction processes. The results show that the electron number density decays quickly. The lifetimes of electrons are shortened by about two orders with increasing ionization degree. Electrons then attach to neutral particles and produce negative ions. When the initial electron densities are in the range of 10(10) similar to 10(14) cm(-3), the negative ions have sufficiently high densities and long lifetimes for air purification, disinfection and sterilization. Electrons, O-2(-), O-4(-), CO4- and CO3- are the dominant negative species when the initial electron density n(e0) <= 10(13) cm(-3), and only electrons and CO3- are left when n(e0) >= 10(15) cm(-3). N-2(+), N-4(+) and O-2(+) are dominant in the positive charges for any ionization degree. Other positive species, such as O-4(+), N-3(+), NO+, NO2+, Ar-2(+) and H3O+ center dot H2O, are dominant only for a certain ionization degree and in a certain period.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1009-0630			WOS:000308811000007

In this study, we investigate how the selectivity of a tris(phosphine)borane iron(I) catalyst, (P3Fe+)-Fe-B, for catalyzing the nitrogen reduction reaction (N2RR, N-2-to-NH3 conversion) versus HER changes as a function of acid pK(a). We find that there is a strong correlation between pKa and N2RR efficiency. Stoichiometric studies indicate that the anilinium triflate acids employed are only compatible with the formation of early stage intermediates of N-2 reduction (e.g., Fe(NNH) or Fe(NNH2)) in the presence of the metallocene reductant Cp*Co-2. This suggests that the interaction of acid and reductant is playing a critical role in N-H bond-forming reactions. DFT studies identify a protonated metallocene species as a strong PCET donor and suggest that it should be capable of forming the early stage N-H bonds critical for N2RR. Furthermore, DFT studies also suggest that the observed pK(a) effect on N2RR efficiency is attributable to the rate and thermodynamics of Cp*Co-2 protonation by the different anilinium acids. Inclusion of Cp*Co-2(+) as a cocatalyst in controlled potential electrolysis experiments leads to improved yields of NH3. The data presented provide what is to our knowledge the first unambiguous demonstration of electrocatalytic nitrogen fixation by a molecular catalyst (up to 6.7 equiv of NH3 per Fe at -2.1 V vs Fc(+/0)).									90	0	0	0	8	0	90			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000432753400014	29669205

Eco-friendly reusable, inexpensive, superparamagnetic nano sizes are the main reasons for its use in various fields. Several examples are available in the literature wherein MIONPs have been exploited as efficient nanocatalysts for organic transformations. There is no review available focusing on MIONPs catalyzed organic transformation except for coupling reactions only. Thus, the present review article focuses on the compendious account of various MIONPs reported catalyzing organic transformation, including synthesis of bioactive compounds, C-C, C-N, C-O, C-S, and S-S coupling, C-H arylation, hydroboration of styrene, oxidation of m-cresol and Friedel-Crafts benzoylation reactions. In addition, the synthetic routes employed to date for modification and functionalization of MIONPs for making them suitable for catalysis have been discussed in detail with schematic illustrations. The future of catalysis lies in the lucid design and construction of the novel, highly active, and reusable magnetic iron nanocomposite catalysts that would ultimately cover the pathway to establish green and sustainable technologies. This review will be enlightening for the researchers in designing novel functionalized MIONPs for sustainable developments. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

While the CO2RR has been demonstrated to be technically feasible, further improvements in catalyst performance through active sites engineering are a prerequisite to accelerate its commercial feasibility for utilization in large CO2-emitting industrial sources. Over the years, the improved understanding of the interaction of CO2 with the active sites has allowed superior catalyst design and subsequent attainment of prominent CO2RR activity in literature. This review tracks the evolution of the understanding of CO2RR active sites on different electrocatalysts such as metals, metal-oxides, single atoms, metal-carbon, and subsequently metal-free carbon-based catalysts. Despite the tremendous research efforts in the field, many scientific questions on the role of various active sites in governing CO2RR activity, selectivity, stability, and pathways are still unanswered. These gaps in knowledge are highlighted and a discussion is set forth on the merits of utilizing advanced in-situ and operando characterization techniques and machine learning (ML). Using this technique, the underlying mechanisms can be discerned, and as a result new strategies for designing active sites may be uncovered. Finally, this review advocates an interdisciplinary approach to discover and design CO2RR active sites (rather than focusing merely on catalyst activity) in a bid to stimulate practical research for industrial application.									70	6	0	0	1	0	71			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000507112100001

The specific capacitance reaches a maximum of 911 F g(-1) at a current density of 10 A g(-1), which can still retain 864 F g(-1) (94.8 % retention) after 10,000 cycles. These much-improved electrochemical performances are attributed to the unique architecture of NiCo2O4 electrode. The interconnected nanonet NiCo2O4 with an ultrahigh surface area significantly facilitates the rapid ion/electron transport and guarantees good mechanical adhesion, while the ultrathin nanoflakes further extend the active sites for fast redox reactions for efficient energy storage.

We using the coupled on-site analysis of an GC?MS/FID/ PDHID with 7 valves and 8 columns in series. The study also discusses the effect of the concentration of the catalyst residuals with the Eac (activation energy) and the evolution of the profile of permanent oxygenated gases, hydrocarbons and sulfurs, as well as the functional waste groups from decomposition during pyrolysis and thermo-oxidative degradation. The origin of the degradation and the beginnings of PP pyrolysis and thermooxidative degradation are explained by hydrolysis mechanisms and thermal reactions that imply successive reactions with these (TEAL), TiO2, and chloride residues, giving rise to ethyl radicals and explaining the formation of alcohols, ketones, carboxylic acids, alkynes and alkenes. The study also found that the gaseous profiles are very consistent with the DTG curves and the Eac, in terms of the appearance of peaks and relevant stages throughout the total temperature range. The effect of Cl, Fe and TEAL on the PP degradation is very high upon passing from an inert to an oxidative atmosphere. This reduces the content of hydrocarbons and oxygenates to CO2 between 49 and 66% because of the attack of the oxygen atom. In the pyrolysis the propylene content oscillates between 42 and 56%. Finally, the initial reaction mechanisms, and the secondary reaction routes, are proposed and demonstrated experimentally in function of the primary volatile compounds quantified. The thermo-oxidative properties of the five PP waste products improve significantly with the addition of 0.1% of a secondary antioxidant.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000640937900005

Examples of anodes for the OER utilizing metallic nanoparticles dispersed in an organic polymer film are still scarce but very promising for water splitting applications. Herein, nickel metal (NiO) nanoparticles were first electrodeposited into a cationic poly.pyrrole-ammonium) film (poly1) electropolymerized onto carbon or ITO electrodes by reduction of an anionic nickel oxalate complex in aqueous borate buffer at pH 6. The NiO nanoparticles were then electro-oxidized into nickel oxide (NiOx) in aqueous borate buffer at pH 9.2. The physical, chemical and electrocatalytic properties of the nanostructured poly1-NiOx material were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled to various electrochemical techniques, and the results were compared with those of NiOx directly deposited on a naked electrode (without polymer) by the same electrochemical procedure. Such characterization clearly evidences the beneficial role of the poly1 matrix to generate smaller and non-agglomerated NiOx particles. Owing to the small size of NiOx nanoparticles (ca. 21 nm) and the great nanostructuration of the poly1-NiOx composite film deposited on the carbon (C) electrode surface, this material displays a very high electrocatalytic OER performance in a nearly neutral solution (pH 9.2) and even in alkaline solution (pH 14) with strong mass activities and turnover frequencies (TOFs) (1.12 A mg(-1) and 0.17 s(-1), respectively, at an overpotential of 0.61 V at pH 9.2, and of 1.28 A mg-1 and 0.19 s-1, respectively, at an overpotential of 0.35 V at pH 14). This performance places the C/poly1-NiOx electrode among the most active anodes based on nickel oxide reported in the literature and undoped with iron ions for the OER. In addition, when the poly1-NiOx film is deposited on a porous ITO electrode, its physisorption on the electrode surface is significantly enhanced, as shown by long-term electrocatalysis at 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Indeed, its catalytic current remains constant after several days of electrocatalysis, demonstrating the great stability of the poly1-NiOx nanocomposite; the polymer matrix maintains the integrity of the NiOx nanoparticles and precludes their corrosion. This material is thus very promising for the implementation of efficient and highly stable anodes for water oxidation.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000442384800005

Developing cost-effective electrode materials with high activities towards corresponding hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxidation (HOR) reactions plays a crucial role in commercial hydrogen production and utilization. Herein, we fabricated a V-doped Ni3N/Ni heterostructure (V-Ni3N/Ni) through a controlled nitridation treatment on a V-incorporated nickel hydroxide precursor. The resultant catalyst exhibits comparable catalytic activity and durability to commercial Pt/C in terms of both HER (a low overpotential of 44 mV at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2)) and HOR (a high current density of 1.54 mA.cm(-2) at 0.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode) under alkaline conditions. The superior activity of V-Ni3N/Ni grown on different substrates further implies its intrinsic performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the coupled metallic Ni and doped V can promote the water adsorption, accelerate the Volmer step of alkaline HER, as well as optimize the adsorption and desorption of hydrogen intermediate (H*) to reach a balanced Delta GH* value.									13	1	0	0	1	0	13			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000655960300002

When a metal oxide catalyst is supported by a switchable ferroelectric underlayer, modifications to the free surface electronic structure can induce changes to the free energy profile of a gas-surface catalytic reaction that either promote or suppress the reaction. The modification of surface properties results from a combination of interface chemistry, surface reconstructions involving adsorbates, and complex interactions between the two, although these interactions are often not characterized in detail. Using the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on barium titanate/anatase (BTO/TiO2) heterostructures as a case study, we use density functional theory to determine how the OER Gibbs free energy profile depends on the polarization of the ferroelectric and the number of TiO2 monolayers. For positive polarizations, the profile is found to be sensitive to the number of TiO2 monolayers, shows extended finite size effects, and deviates substantially from that of unsupported anatase. For negative polarizations, the monolayer dependence is suppressed and the OER profiles remain similar to that of unsupported anatase independent of the number of TiO2 monolayers. To understand the origin of the differences, we analyze in detail the layer-by-layer rumpling, interface chemistry, surface reconstructions, and interface and surface dipoles. The unbalanced response to negative and positive polarizations is shown to arise from the underlying chemistry of the BTO/TiO2 interface. While the interfacial bonding is largely fixed for negatively polarized systems, it is variable and can be tuned by the presence of nearby surface adsorbates for positively polarized systems. The asymmetry limits the effectiveness of the heterojunction. While positively polarized systems are good candidates for the selective enhancement of catalytic reactions involving negatively charged species at the metal oxide free surface, the negatively polarized systems do not effectively enhance catalytic reactions involving positively charged species. Our work points to interface design rules to overcome this limitation and realize heterojunctions with enhanced catalytic functionality.									7	1	0	0	1	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000395869500021	28176991

The consumption of a set of species with antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid (AA), caffeic acid (CA), gallic acid (GA) and trolox (T), is described by a first order kinetics. The rate of the processes is limited by the kinetics of reaction with HO radicals and by the kinetics of charge transfer.Information regarding the scavenger activity of antioxidants is obtained by the relative value of the rate constant of the reaction between antioxidants and HO radicals, k(AO,HO)/k(O2). The number of HO radicals scavenged per molecule of antioxidant is also estimated and ranged from 260 (ascorbic acid) to 500 (gallic acid). The method is applied successfully in the characterization of the scavenger activity of ascorbic acid in a green-tea based beverage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

MoS2 is a star catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic media; however, the alkaline HER activity is deficient due to the sluggish water dissociation process. Herein, Ni(OH)(2)/MoS2 heterostructures with Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters epitaxially decorated on the surface of MoS2 are synthesized towards the alkaline HER. As compared with MoS2, the epitaxial Ni(OH)(2)/MoS2 heterostructures show significantly enhanced HER activity in 1 M KOH, and the overpotential is decreased by nearly 150 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The substantial increase in turnover frequency (TOF) demonstrates that the intrinsic activity is greatly improved after the incorporation of Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters. The presence of Ni(OH)(2) nanoclusters would provide additional water dissociation sites while MoS2 is ready for the adsorption and combination of the generated H*, and this so-called synergistic effect eventually induces significantly enhanced alkaline HER kinetics. Besides, the electron transfer from Ni(OH)(2) to MoS2 increases the proton affinity of MoS2. The present results describe an interesting case of an atomic-scale electrochemically inert material promoted HER process, and would open a new avenue into designing efficient hetero-nanostructures towards electrocatalytic applications.									51	2	0	0	3	0	51			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000448344100021	30288525

Its preparation via a multi-step ceramic route or various wet chemistry-based routes is notoriously difficult. The present work demonstrates that Sr2FeMoO6 can be mechanosynthesized at ambient temperature in air directly from its precursors (SrO, alpha-Fe, MoO3) in the form of nanostructured powders, without the need for solvents and/or calcination under controlled oxygen fugacity. The mechanically induced evolution of the Sr2FeMoO6 phase and the far-from-equilibrium structural state of the reaction product are systematically monitored with XRD and a variety of spectroscopic techniques including Raman spectroscopy, Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The unique extensive oxidation of iron species (Fe-0 -> Fe3+) with simultaneous reduction of Mo cations (Mo6+ -> Mo5+), occuring during the mechanosynthesis of Sr2FeMoO6, is attributed to the mechanically triggered formation of tiny metallic iron nanoparticles in superparamagnetic state with a large reaction surface and a high oxidation affinity, whose steady presence in the reaction mixture of the milled educts initiates/promotes the swift redox reaction. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that the mechanosynthesized Sr2FeMoO6, even after its moderate thermal treatment at 923 K for 30 min in air, exhibits the nanostructured nature with the average particle size of 21(4) nm. At the short-range scale, the nanostructure of the as-prepared Sr2FeMoO6 is characterized by both, the strongly distorted geometry of the constituent FeO6 octahedra and the extraordinarily high degree of anti-site disorder. The degree of anti-site disorder ASD = 0.5, derived independently from the present experimental XRD, Mossbauer, and SQUID magnetization data, corresponds to the completely random distribution of Fe3+ and Mo5+ cations over the sites of octahedral coordination provided by the double perovskite structure. Moreover, the fully anti-site disordered Sr2FeMoO6 nanoparticles exhibit superparamagnetism with the blocking temperature T-B = 240 K and the deteriorated effective magnetic moment mu = 0.055 mu(B) per formula unit.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2646			WOS:000778806700001	35372274

This large multisubunit membrane protein complex functions to absorb light energy and catalyze the oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. The resolution of the 3D structure is 24 Angstrom and emphasizes the dimeric nature of the supercomplex. The extrinsic proteins of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) are readily observed as a tetrameric cluster bound to the lumenal surface. By considering higher resolution data, obtained from electron crystallography, it has been possible to relate the binding sites of the OEC proteins with the underlying intrinsic membrane subunits of the photochemical reaction center core. The model suggests that the 33 kDa OEC protein is located towards the CP47/D2 side of the reaction center but is also positioned over the C-terminal helices of the D1 protein including its CD lumenal loop. In contrast, the model predicts that the 23/17 kDa OEC proteins are positioned at the N-terminus of the D1 protein incorporating the AB lumenal [GRAPH] loop of this protein and two other unidentified transmembrane helices. Overall the 3D model represents a significant step forward in revealing the structure of the photosynthetic OEC whose activity is required to sustain the aerobic atmosphere on our planet.									168	2	0	0	154	0	173			1072-8368			WOS:000084881200015	10625426

Significant breakthroughs have been achieved with certain first row transition metal complexes in terms of low overpotentials and large turnover rates, but the majority of reported work utilized purified and deoxygenated solvents (most commonly mixtures of organic solvents/acids). Realizing that the design of earth abundant metal catalysts that operate under truly ambient conditions remains an unresolved challenge, we have now developed an electronically tuned Co(III) corrole that can catalyze the HER from aqueous sulfuric acid at as low as -0.3 V vs NHE, with a turnover frequency of 600 s(-1)and >>10(7) catalytic turnovers. Under aerobic conditions, using H2O from naturally available sources without any pretreatment, the same complex catalyzes the reduction of H+ with a Faradaic Yield (FY) of 52%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the electron density on a putative hydride species is delocalized off from the H atom into the macrocycle. This makes the protonation of a [Co(III)-H](-) species the rate determining step (rds) for the the experimental data.

Herein, two inexpensive iron complexes as proton-independent electron reservoirs (ERs) are described for decoupled water electrolysis. (Ferrocenylmethyl) trimethylammonium chloride and Na-4[Fe(CN)(6)], which have proper redox potentials in aqueous media, are able to couple their oxidation with HER. The subsequent reduction of the oxidized ER+ is then paired with OER. Both steps require much smaller voltage than that of direct water splitting. Nearly 100% Faradic efficiency and remarkable cycling stability were obtained for both ERs. Such decoupled water splitting could also be driven by photovoltaic cells with small photovoltages under sunlight irradiation. Furthermore, a two-step electrolysis of HER and the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural mediated by Na-4[Fe(CN)(6)] was demonstrated under alkaline conditions, producing H-2 and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid. This work presents a decoupled water electrolyzer design with great flexibility and safety advantages.									86	9	0	0	5	0	89			2451-9294			WOS:000429434900019

Herein, a novel and-facile approach by melamine polymerization, exfoliation and,Co2+-assisted thermal annealing, is developed to fabricate Co nanoparticles embedded in bamboo-like and nitrogen-rich carbonitride nanotubes (Co@NCN). The electronic interaction between the embedded Co nanoparticles and N-rich carbonitride nanotubes could strongly promote the HER performance. The optimized Co@NCN-800 exhibits outstanding HER activity with an onset potential of -89 mV (vs RHE), a large exchange current density of 62.2 mu A cm(-2), and small Tafel slope of 82 mV dec(-1), as well as excellent stability (5000 cycles) in acid media, demonstrating the potential for the replacement of Pt-based catalysts. Control experiments reveal that the superior performance should be ascribed to the synergistic effects between embedded Co nanoparticles and N-rich carbonitride nanotubes, which originate from the high pyridinic N content, fast charge transfer rate from Co particles to electrodes via electronic coupling, and porous and bamboo-like carbonitride nanotubes for more active sites in HER.									90	3	0	0	4	0	92			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000372479300017	26915599

Herein we demonstrate a chemical transformation strategy to synthesize porous CoP ultrathin nanosheets with sub-1.1 nm thickness and exposed {200} facets via phosphidation of Co3O4 precursors. The resultant samples exhibit outstanding electrochemical HER performance: a low overpotential (only 56 and 131 mV are required for current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively), a small Tafel slope of 44 mV per decade, a good stability of over 20 h, and a high mass activity of 151 A g(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV. The latter is about 80 times higher than that of CoP nanoparticles. Experimental data and density functional theory calculations reveal that a high proportion of reactive {200} facets, high utilization efficiency of active sites, metallic nature, appropriate structural disorder, facile electron/mass transfer and rich active sites benefiting from the unique ultrathin and porous structure are the key factors for the greatly improved activity. Additionally, this facile chemical conversion strategy can be developed to a generalized method for preparing porous ultrathin nanosheets of CoSe2 and CoS that cannot be obtained using other methods.									205	15	0	0	8	0	206			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000397560500033	28553512

The observations were conducted using the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. A very detailed abundance analysis via spectral synthesis has been carried out for these two stars, as well as for two other metal-poor objects with published spectra, using both Kurucz and OSMARCS model photospheres and taking into account consistently the non-LTE (NLTE) effects on the line formation. We have also reassessed all published boron abundances of old disk and halo unevolved stars. Our analysis shows that the combination of high effective temperature (T-eff greater than or similar to 6000 K, for which boron is mainly ionized) and low metallicity ([Fe/H] less than or similar to -1) makes it difficult to obtain accurate estimates of boron abundances from the B I lambda 2497 line. This is the case of HD 84937 and three other published objects (including two stars with [Fe/H] similar to -3), for which only upper limits can be established. ED +23 degrees 3130, with [Fe/H] similar to -2.9 and log N(B)(NLTE) = 0.05 +/- 0.30, appears then as the most metal-poor star for which a firm measurement of the boron abundance presently exists. The evolution of the boron abundance with metallicity that emerges from the seven remaining stars with T-eff < 6000 K and [Fe/H] < -1, for which beryllium abundances were derived using the same stellar parameters, shows a linear increase with a slope of similar to 1. Furthermore, the B/Be ratio found is constant at a value of similar to 20 for stars in the range -3 < [Fe/H] < -1. These results point to spallation reactions of ambient protons and alpha-particles with energetic particles enriched in CNO as the origin of boron and beryllium in halo stars.									62	0	0	0	0	0	62			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000074273300020

We found that deposition of a similar to 2-nanometer nickel film on n-type silicon (n-Si) with its native oxide affords a high-performance metal-insulator-semiconductor photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation in both aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH, pH = 14) and aqueous borate buffer (pH = 9.5) solutions. The Ni film acted as a surface protection layer against corrosion and as a nonprecious metal electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution. In 1 M aqueous KOH, the Ni/n-Si photoanodes exhibited high PEC activity with a low onset potential (similar to 1.07 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode), high photocurrent density, and durability. The electrode showed no sign of decay after similar to 80 hours of continuous PEC water oxidation in a mixed lithium borate-potassium borate electrolyte. The high photovoltage was attributed to a high built-in potential in a metal-insulator-semiconductor-like device with an ultrathin, incomplete screening Ni/NiOx layer from the electrolyte.									531	21	0	0	39	0	536			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000326923000032	24233719

Mineralogical, chemical, and isotopic data are now routinely used to identify where fluid has flowed in metamorphic terranes, to measure the amount of fluid, to constrain the direction of flow relative to temperature and pressure gradients and lithologic contacts, and to determine the age of flow. Fluid may flow through a static, interconnected network of microscopic tubes at grain corners only under special combinations of mineralogy, fluid composition, pressure, and temperature. Fluid flow typically is restricted to hydraulic fractures whose formation and maintenance require dynamic processes such as increasing temperature, active devolatilization reactions, and/or deformation. Hydraulic fracture flow is heterogeneous in both space and time. Metamorphic fluid transport may be driven by density differences between rock and fluid, by density variations in fluid generated from temperature gradients, by deformation, and by surface tension. Metamorphic fluid flow plays a significant role in heat and mass transfer in Earth's crust and in the mechanisms and rates of deformation.									77	5	4	0	2	0	84			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:A1994PB52000025

In aqueous electrolyte with a sacrificial hole acceptor (SO32-), photoelectrodes show a morphology-dependent performance. Films prepared by a dispersion-spray method with a nanostructured surface (feature size of similar to 20 nm) gave photocurrents up to 0.23 +/- 0.02 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE under standard simulated solar illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals a constant flat-band potential over a wide pH range at +0.31 V-NHE. The solar water oxidation photocurrent with bare BBL electrodes is found to increase with increasing pH, and no evidence of semiconductor oxidation was observed over a 30 min testing time. Characterization of the photo-oxidation reaction suggests H2O2 or center dot OH production with the bare film, while functionalization of the interface with 1 nm of TiO2 followed by a nickel-cobalt catalyst gave solar photocurrents of 20-30 mu A cm(-2), corresponding with 02 evolution. Limitations to photocurrent production are discussed.									76	2	0	0	6	0	77			0002-7863			WOS:000366874700001	26576469

This method provides only an average corrosion rate over the exposure time and is destructive. The work presented introduces a new non-destructive method for real-time monitoring of atmospheric Mg alloy corrosion rates based on the evolved hydrogen gas. This is realized with an adaption of the gravimetric hydrogen collection method. The effect of temperature and atmospheric pressure variations during the experiment can be compensated and reliable atmospheric hydrogen evolution rates can be measured. The new technique was applied to monitor real-time atmospheric corrosion rates of Mg alloys AZ31 and AZ91 with different amounts of NaCl contamination. Comparing the results of the gravimetric hydrogen method with mass loss experiments reveals a good correlation of the consumed charge over the total exposure time, thus validating the new technique. Evidence for the contribution of O-2 reduction reaction to cathodic processes on Mg alloy atmospheric corrosion is presented. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

Defect engineering of layered lattices to fully utilize MX2 nanosheets is highly desirable. Herein, we report a universal synthesis of defective MX2 nanosheets by modulating both the basal planes and the interlayers. A series of basal plane-disordered and interlayer-expanded MX2 (M = Mo, W, Sn; X = S, Se) nanosheets are synthesized. Interlayer spacings of the MX2 nanosheets are significantly enlarged to 0.93-1.05 nm with an increase of 0.34-0.40 nm, owing to species intercalation. Abundant defects resulting from the wide interlayer expansion and the disordered basal planes offer extensive unsaturated chalcogen atoms as active sites for HER. Consequently, interlayer-expanded and defect-rich (IEDR) MX2 catalysts exhibit striking activities, delivering small Tafel slopes, low onset overpotentials, large cathodic current densities and excellent long-term stabilities. Our work paves a new pathway to improve the electrocatalytic HER activity by defect modulation.									16	4	0	0	0	0	16			2052-1553			WOS:000452114200018

Herein, we successfully constructed ultra-thin N,P co-doped carbon (NPC) on the surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) by using phytic acid (PA) as a "guide". The rich phosphate groups in PA allow them to be covalently modified on the surface of CNT by the condensation reaction and to further attract large aniline monomers through acid-base interactions, resulting in the uniform and tight bonding between polyaniline and CNT after the polymerization process. During the subsequent thermal reaction, PA also serves as a self-sacrificial dopant for the formation of ultra-thin NPC and the doping amount of P in NPC can be easily adjusted by changing the amount of PA. Due to the abundance of active sites, large electrochemically active surface area and rapid electron transfer, the developed CNT@NPC presents remarkable electrocatalytic activities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 167, 440 and 304 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. In particular, its acidic HER activity exceeds that of most reported metal-free electrocatalysts and is comparable to that of some excellent transition metal-based catalysts. The approach proposed here is of potential importance for the preparation of ideal heteroatom-doped carbon/nanocarbon composites for use in a variety of future energy conversion systems.									23	0	0	0	2	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000506887500034	31774093

High-cost platinum (Pt) has an intrinsically high activity as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its unique properties. However, there is a pressing need for developing inexpensive alternatives to high-cost Pt-based catalysts for large-scale H-2 production, such as carbon-based catalysts. In this work, we report the use of hollow carbon sphere catalysts activated by ruthenium (Ru) structures encapsulated in the cavity. Hollow carbon sphere-confined Ru nanoparticles (HCRNs) and hollow carbon sphere-confined Ru layers (HCRLs) exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the alkaline HER. The HCRNs (Ru: 4.8 wt%) and HCRLs (Ru: 23.5 wt%) display high turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 0.77 s(-1) and 0.25 s(-1) at 15 mV, respectively, and small overpotentials of 33 and 18 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)), respectively. These catalysts also display a remarkable stability for 10 000 cycles, outperforming other Ru/C catalysts as well as commercial Pt/C catalysts (20 wt%, TOF = 0.19 s(-1) at 15 mV, eta(10) = 38 mV). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the carbon shells are activated by electron transfer from the encapsulated Ru. These unique nanostructures enhance the carbon atoms-adsorbed hydrogen atom bond and lower the Delta G(H)* on the carbon surface via electron transport between their contact interfaces.									53	6	0	0	3	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463814800069

On the other hand, bimetallic phosphides are emerging for their unique potentials for electrocatalysis. Herein, we have demonstrated the fabrication of heterostructured nanosheet arrays of ternary nickel-cobalt phosphide (NiCo2P2) and GQD hybrid (NCP/G NSs) and the use as bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline medium. NCP/G NSs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards hydrogen evolution reaction (reaching 100 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low overpotential of 119 mV), superior to any other non-noble metal catalyst. Furthermore, an electrolyzer equipped with two identical NCP/G NS electrodes at an exceptionally small amount of catalyst loading (0.31 mg cm(-2)) is able to achieve efficient overall water splitting (10 mA cm(-2) at 1.61 V) with high stability. The careful comparison with NiCo2P2 nanowires (NCP NWs) synthesized under the same conditions without GQDs (in terms of electrocatalytic performance, atomic and electronic structures, and electrochemical properties) reveals the mechanistic roles of GQDs in morphology control and performance enhancement. In addition, the performance comparison with ternary nickel-cobalt oxide (NiCo2O4) and GQD hybrid (NCO/G NSs) suggests the advantage of bimetallic phosphides over oxide counterparts.									110	7	0	0	3	0	112			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000432604600033

The activated clays are endowed with much higher photocatalytic abilities than the raw one. Degradation ratios of rhodamine B and methyl orange under UV light were found up to 99.8% and 95.4% within 120 min. Beside efficient dye degradations, a high H-2 evolution rate of 12.5 umol/g/h was reached by using the [Ni(2,2'-bipy)(3)]Cl-2/sepiolite composite as the catalyst. Coating the as-synthesized material on surfaces leads to extraordinary superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties. The cheap materials can be widely used in photocatalytic water purification and/or oil-water mixture separations. (C) 2019 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry.

However, studies on the N doping of amorphous MoSx, which is a more active catalyst, have not been reported to date. In this study, via a simple method, we fabricated N-doped amorphous MoSx for the first time and studied the correlations between the N dopant and the HER performance. Via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical formation energy calculations, we have found that a N dopant in basal plane S2- plays a very important role in the improvement of the HER performance and remains stable during this dynamic transformation process. A N dopant in basal plane S2- can increase the number of active sites toward the HER and enhance the conductivity of the catalysts as well as a N dopant in c-MoS2. In addition to this, the first-principles calculations further suggested that a N dopant in basal plane S2- could improve the activity of unsaturated Mo-V active sites by bringing its hydrogen adsorption free energy closer to zero. As a result, N-doped amorphous MoSx possesses an overpotential of 143 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 57 mV dec(-1), much better than those of a-MoSx. These results provide useful insights for the future development of nonmetal-doped MoSx catalysts in the HER.									23	1	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000471722100019	31157804

The fungi were grown under oxygen or air atmosphere on an agar medium with or without spruce sapwood blocks. The dimeric model (I) was impregnated onto agar or wood block in cultures to clarify the possible effect of wood as growth substrate. In the case of vanillic acid (model II), birch wood was used. The effect of supplemented nutrient nitrogen (2 mM N) and glucose (0.1 or 1.0% w/v) on demethoxylation was also studied. G. trabeum enhanced the production of (CO2)-C-14 from the dimer in the presence of spruce wood blocks. It released (CO2)-C-14 from the methoxyl groups giving 30-60% of the applied activity in 8 weeks. P. placenta produced almost 30% (CO2)-C-14 from vanillic acid (model II) in 9 weeks under oxygen, but from the methoxyl group of the dimer only 3% of (CO2)-C-14 was evolved in 4 weeks. The biomasses determined as ergosterol assay showed variation from 14 to 226 mu g g(-1) dry weight of agar, and 2 to 9 mu g g(-1)of wood, but they did not correlate with the production of (CO2)-C-14. The results indicate that these brown-rot fungi possess different mechanisms for demethoxylation.									58	2	0	0	45	1	60			0923-9820	1572-9729		WOS:000256338300010	17973193

The above grid-like ZnO film was prepared in zinc nitrate solution by electrodeposition using polystyrene (PS) microsphere templates. The morphology and composition were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The performance was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The results showed that the active layer of the array PbO2 electrode possesses a regular petal-like array structure that consists of many clustered PbO2 nanospheres. The array structure can increase the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). The total voltammetric charge (q(T)*) is 2.6 times that of the traditional PbO2 electrode. Additionally, the array electrode shows a larger exchange current density (i(0)), lower activation energy (E-a) and charge transfer resistance (R-ct) during the process of oxygen evolution. In the degradation process of phenol, the degradation rate constant of the array PbO2 electrode is significantly greater than that of a traditional PbO2 electrode. The results demonstrated that the array PbO2 electrode with enhanced electrocatalytic performance is a promising material for degrading organic effluents.

However, the small size and large specific surface area intrinsically associated with ACs pose challenges in the synthesis and stabilization of Pt-ACs without agglomeration. Herein, we report a novel one-step carbon-defectdriven electroless deposition method to produce ultrasmall but well-defined and stable Pt-ACs supported by defective graphene (Pt-AC/DG) structures. A theoretical simulation clearly revealed that the defective regions with a lower work function and hence a higher reducing capacity compared to those of normal hexagonal sites triggered the reduction of Pt ions preferentially at the defect sites. Moreover, the strong binding energy between Pt and carbon defects effectively restricted the migration of spontaneously reduced Pt atoms to immobilize/stabilize the resultant Pt-ACs. Electrochemical analyses demonstrated the high performance of Pt-ACs in catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction, showing a greatly enhanced mass activity, a high Pt utilization efficiency, and excellent stability compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts. The integration of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis with Pt-AC/DG as a cathode exhibited an excellent hydrogen generation activity and extraordinary stability (during 200 h of electrolysis) with a greatly reduced Pt usage compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts.									95	7	0	0	5	0	99			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000526393100022	32088958

The design and synthesis of inexpensive and readily available catalysts with excellent catalytic activity, good stability, and high selectivity is very important but faces enormous challenges. In this paper, we study the catalytic properties of TM-TCNQ monolayers as single atom catalysts for CO2 reduction. The results show that the TM-TCNQ monolayers are very stable and effectively bind the isolated metal atoms in place. These bound metal atoms can then act as single-atom catalysts. Most of the ten transition metal series atoms studied also exhibit good inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction. The primary reduction product of Sc-TCNQ and Ti-TCNQ is CH4, however this reaction requires a high overpotential above 2 V. The main catalytic product of V-TCNQ, Cr-TCNQ, Mn-TCNQ, Ni-TCNQ and Cu-TCNQ is HCOOH. For Fe-TCNQ and Co-TCNQ, HCHO is dominant. CO is primarily produced from Zn-TCNQ. Remarkably, the overpotentials of these last eight materials are all small enough (0.12 to 0.45 V) to prepare competitive catalysts experimentally. These overpotentials are all much lower than the 0.77 V value for the Cu (211) surface, which is the most active stepped solid surface. Compared with the experimentally available molecular catalyst (iron(0) porphyrin complex) for CO2 reduction with very good performance (overpotential just 0.465 V), some of our proposed 2D TM-TCNQ monolayers have comparable or even smaller overpotentials, and may provide new opportunities. Since these materials will all be stable under real world conditions, we predict that the TM-TCNQ materials will exhibit strong catalytic activity in the catalytic reduction of CO2, thus making TM-TCNQ monolayers exciting new CO2 electrocatalytic reduction reaction catalysts.									72	1	0	0	3	0	72			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000459331600033

Because of their high surface energy, single atoms are highly mobile and tend to form aggregate during synthetic and catalytic processes. Therefore, it is a significant challenge to fabricate isolated single atomic site catalysts with good stability. Herein, a gentle method to stabilize single atomic site metal by constructing defects on the surface of supports is presented. As a proof of concept, single atomic site Au supported on defective TiO2 nanosheets is prepared and it is discovered that (1) the surface defects on TiO2 nanosheets can effectively stabilize Au single atomic sites through forming the Ti-Au-Ti structure; and (2) the Ti-Au-Ti structure can also promote the catalytic properties through reducing the energy barrier and relieving the competitive adsorption on isolated Au atomic sites. It is believed that this work paves a way to design stable and active single atomic site catalysts on oxide supports.									523	45	0	0	39	1	534			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000427111300007	29363197

Pyrolysis tests were carried out in nitrogen and carbon dioxide environments which are the main diluting gasses of air and oxy-fuel environment, respectively. Pyrolysis results of the parent fuels and the blend show that weight loss profiles are almost the same up to a temperature of 700 degrees C in these two environments, indicating that CO2 behaves as an inert gas in this temperature range. However, further weight loss takes place in CO2 atmosphere at higher temperatures due to CO2-char gasification reaction which leads to significant increase in CO and COS formation as observed in FTIR evolution profiles. Comparison between experimental and theoretical pyrolysis profiles of the blend samples reveals that there is no synergy in both atmospheres. Combustion experiments were carried out in four different atmospheres; air. oxygen-enriched air environment (30% O2-70% N-2), oxy-fuel environment (21% O-2-79% CO2) and oxygen-enriched oxy-fuel environment (30% O2-70% CO2). Replacing N-2 in the combustion environment by CO2 causes slight delay (lower maximum rate of weight loss and higher burnout temperature) in the combustion of all samples. However, this effect is found to be more significant for olive residue than lignite. Elevated oxygen levels shift combustion profiles to lower temperatures and increase the rate of weight loss. Combustion profiles of olive residue/lignite blends lie between those of individual fuels. Comparison between experimental and theoretical combustion profiles and characteristic temperatures of the blend samples indicates synergistic interactions between the parent fuels during co-combustion of olive residue and lignite.

The method involves formation of hydroxides on GO using ammonia under hydrothermal conditions. Subsequent thermal treatment at 300 degrees C led to the conversion of hydroxides into single-phase NiCo2O4 atop the RGO. The synthesized products are characterized through several techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy (RS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The FE-SEM investigations reveal the growth of a layer by layer assembly of NiCo2O4-RGO (2:1) nanocomposite, where the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles are tightly packed between the layers of RGO. Further, the catalytic properties of the NiCo2O4-RGO nanocomposite are investigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. It is observed that the special structural features of the NiCo2O4-RGO (2:1) nanocomposite, including layer by layer assembly, integrity and excellent dispersion of the NiCo2O4 nanoparticles atop the RGO, produced a synergistic effect and therefore significantly improved the electrochemical performance. The oxidation potential (0.135 V) of NiCo2O4-RGO (2:1) nanocomposite was observed to be lower than that of bare NiCo2O4 nanoparticles (0.33 V), whereas the corresponding current densities were measured to be 4.1 mA/cm(2) and 3.11 mA/cm(2), respectively.

To clarify the roles of Co and P vacancies in CoP for water splitting, a theoretical study based on density functional theory was carried out in this paper. The geometric and electronic structures, activity and stability of the CoP (101)B surface, CoP (101)B with the Co vacancy (Co-vac) and the P vacancy (P-vac) are investigated. The results indicate that the CoP (101)B surface with P-vac and Co-vac can enhance the electron transfer to the surface. The P-vac will upward shift the Co d-band center near the vacancy site, which promotes the adsorption of H on the Co atom. As a result, the bridge Co-Co sites near the vacancy become the active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (Delta G(H*) = 0.01 eV). The loss of the Co atom also results in an upward shift of its d-band center, which will enhance the H adsorption on the adjacent Co sites. The unevenly distributed electrons due to the presence of vacancies on the surface cause spontaneous dissociation of H2O molecules. Furthermore, the thermodynamic analysis and surface energy find that the CoP (101)B and (101)B facets with Co-vac and P-vac present good stability. The current work has shed light onto the mechanism of water splitting on the surface of phosphide with vacancies. Our study suggests that engineering vacancies on CoP is a feasible route to improve its catalytic activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000752518000001	35133361

However, they suffer from problems of voltage decay, capacity fading, and structural deterioration, which hinder their practical application. Therefore, a mechanistic understanding of the cationic/anionic redox activity and capacity fading is indispensable for the further improvement of electrochemical performance. Here, a prototype cathode material of P2-type Na0.6Mg0.3Mn0.7O2 is comprehensively investigated, which presents both cationic and anionic redox behaviors during the cycling process. By a combination of soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electroanalytical methods, we unambiguously reveal that only oxygen redox reaction is involved in the initial charge process, then both oxygen and manganese participate in the charge compensation in the following discharge process. In addition, a gradient distribution of Mn valence state from surface to bulk is disclosed, which could be mainly related to the irreversible oxygen activity during the charge process. Furthermore, we find that the average oxidation state of Mn is reduced upon extended cycles, leading to the noticeable capacity fading. Our results provide deeper insights into the intrinsic cationic/anionic redox mechanism of P2-type materials, which is vital for the rational design and optimization of advanced cathode materials for SIBs.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10				1996-1073		WOS:000588890000001

Herein, a self-template strategy of hydrothermal treatment of solid Ni-Co glycerate nanospheres followed by phosphorization is delivered to synthesize hierarchical NiCoP hollow nanoflowers with ultrathin nanosheet assembly. The microstructure of NiCoP can be availably tailored by adjusting the hydrothermal treatment temperature through affecting the hydrolysis process of Ni-Co glycerate nanospheres and the occurred Kirkendall effect. Benefitting from the promoted exposure of active sites and affluent mass diffusion routes, the HER performance of the NiCoP hollow nanoflowers has been obviously enhanced in contrast with the solid NiCoP nanospheres. The fabricated NiCoP hollow nanoflowers yield the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at small over-potentials of 95 and 127 mV in 0.5 mol L-1 H2SO4 and 1.0 mol L-1 KOH solution, respectively. Moreover, the two-electrode alkaline cell assembled with the NiCoP and Ir/C catalysts exhibits sustainable stability for overall water splitting. The work provides a simple but efficient method to regulate the microstructure of transition metal phosphides, which is helpful for achieving high-performance hydrogen evolution catalysts based on solid-state metal alkoxides.

In comparison with metal oxides, that do not offer well-defined active surfaces, POMs have a controlled, discrete structure that allows for precise correlations between experiment and computational analyses. Thus, beyond highly active WOCs, POMs are also model systems to gain deeper mechanistic understanding on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The tetracobalt Weakley sandwich [Co-4(II)(H2O)(2)(B-alpha-PW9O34)(2)](10-) (Co-4-WS) has been one of the most extensively studied. We have compared its activity with that of the iron analog [Fe-4(III)(H2O)(2)(B-alpha-PW9O34)(2)](6-) (Fe-4-WS) looking for the electronic effects determining their activity. Furthermore, the effect of POM nuclearity was also investigated by comparison with the iron- and cobalt-monosubstituted Keggin clusters. Electrocatalytic experiments employing solid state electrodes containing the POMs and the corresponding computational calculations demonstrate that Co-II-POMs display better WOC activity than the Fe-III derivatives. Moreover, the activity of POMs is less influenced by their nuclearity, thus Weakley sandwich moieties show slightly improved WOC characteristics than Keggin clusters. In good agreement with the experimental data, computational methods, including pK(a) values, confirm that the resting state for Fe-POMs in neutral media corresponds to the S-1 (Fe-III-OH) species. Overall, the proposed reaction mechanism for Fe-4-WS is analogous to that found for Co-4-WS, despite their electronic differences. The potential limiting step is a proton-coupled electron transfer event yielding the active S-2 (Fe-IV=O) species, which receives a water nucleophilic attack to form the O-O bond. The latter has activation energies slightly higher than those computed for the Co-POMs, in good agreement with experimental observations. These results provide new insights for the accurate understanding of the structure-reactivity relationships of polyoxometalates in particular, and or metal oxides in general, which are of utmost importance for the development of new bottom-up synthetic approaches to design efficient, robust and non-expensive earth-abundant water oxidation catalysts.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000654943700001	34257875

The results show that after solvothermal processing (Co-NC) the catalyst has a more homogeneous anemone structure, a higher nitrogen content, a larger BET surface area and a higher degree of graphitization compared to the catalyst produced after non-solvothermal processing (Co-MA). The results of electrochemical tests indicate that Co-NC, compared to commercial 20% Pt/C and Co-MA, has an improved mass transfer process and sufficient active site exposure, which brings about superb oxygen reduction electrocatalytic activity, a higher reduction potential (-0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl), a limiting diffusion current (5.44 mA cm(-2)) and excellent stability in 0.1 M KOH solution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2046-2069			WOS:000438939300042	35542145

However, some of these compounds are difficult to be fabricated directly in film form due to the ease of valence variation of transition-metal elements. In this work, we reveal the reversible structural transition between SrVO3 and Sr2V2O7 films via thermal treatment in oxygen atmosphere or in vacuum. Based on this, Sr2V2O7 epitaxial films are successfully synthesized and studied. Property characterizations show that the semitransparent and metallic SrVO3 could reversibly switch into transparent and insulating Sr2V2O7, implying potential applications in controllable electronic and optical devices.									2	1	0	0	1	0	3			1674-0068	2327-2244		WOS:000512882000013

Molybdenum selenide (MoSe2) is a fascinating 2D TMD system because of its plentiful active selenium edge sites, however, its reported outputs are deficient due to their inactive facet edges and poor conductivity. Herein, we tackled the key issues by engineering hybrid composites using a molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) inserted MoSe2 matrix, in the first time. For this approach, a simple one-step chemical reaction method was employed to synthesize the highly active MoSe2-Mo2C hybrid nanoarrays for energy storage and electrocatalytic water splitting applications. Microscopic analyses clearly showed the formation of Mo2C embedded MoSe2 hybrid nanoarray structured morphology composed of nanosized spherical grains with plenty of active sites. Improved surface area, modified morphology, highly conductive nature, and abundant active sites were obviously confirmed for the MoSe2-Mo2C hybrid. Interestingly, MoSe2-Mo2C hybrid nanoarrays exposed excellent capacitance with superior rate capability behavior and outstanding hydrogen evolution activity with their low overpotential, small Tafel slope and high current density.									82	4	0	0	8	0	82			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000515195200050

In this work, we originally develop a silk-cocoon structured S-rich cobalt polysulfide (CoSx, x approximate to 3.9) catalyst with extremely high HER activity through a facile hydrothermal process. The formation mechanism of the silk-cocoon structured CoSx has been systematically studied and the key factors in the formation of this structure are discussed. Such a nanostructured catalyst has hollow spheres that are interwoven by numerous sub-10 nm nanofibers to form into a three-dimensional conductive network by connection of micrometer long nanofibers. The silk-cocoon structured CoSx shows excellent HER activity with an onset potential of 0 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode and a Tafel slope of 41 mV dec(-1). The activity is much higher than that of the reported metal sulfide materials and is even comparable to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the overpotential to yield a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 42 mV. We ascribe the high HER activity to the S-rich sites and the conductive silk-cocoon structure, which can benefit the charge transfer of the material. Thus, this work provides a guiding strategy for synthesis of nanostructured transition metal polysulfides with enhanced HER catalytic performance.									61	2	0	0	4	0	62			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000445215400013

The functionalization with metallic copper is based on electrostatic interactions between sulfonate groups present on the modified carbon surface and copper(II) cations in aqueous solution and its subsequent chemical or electrochemical reduction to metallic copper. Bimetallic modified electrodes based on Cu/Pt were also obtained by replacement of metallic copper on the carbon surface by immersion of the surface in a K2PtCl6 aqueous solution. The amount of copper was estimated by stripping voltammetry in aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 whereas adsorption/desorption of hydrogen was used in the same electrolyte to quantify the platinum present on the carbon surface. The resulting metallic functionalized surfaces were characterized by cyclic voltammetry to determine their activity for the electrochemical reduction of nitrate and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

Here, self-assembled ultralow Ru, Ni-doped Fe2O3 with a lily shaped morphology was synthesized on iron foam (RuNi-Fe2O3/IF) via a facile one-step hydrothermal process, in which the intact lily shaped RuNi-Fe2O3/IF was obtained by adjusting the ratio of Ru/Ni. Benefitting from the Ru/Ni chemical substitution, the as-synthesized RuNi-Fe2O3/IF can act as free-standing dual-function electrodes that are applied to electrocatalysis for the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH, requiring an overpotential of 75.0 mV to drive 100 mA cm(-2) for HER and 329.0 mV for OER. Moreover, the overall water splitting catalyzed by RuNi-Fe2O3/IF only demands ultralow cell voltages of 1.66 and 1.73 V to drive 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 mol L-1 KOH and 1.0 mol L-1 KOH seawater electrolytes, respectively. The electrodes show remarkable long-term durability, maintaining current densities exceeding 100 mA cm(-2) for more than 100 h and thus outperforming the two-electrode system composed of noble catalysts. This work provides an efficient, economical method to synthesize self-standing bifunctional electrodes for large-current-density alkaline seawater electrolysis, which is of significant importance for ecological protection and energy exploitation.

One of the crucial advancements in this context was the development of more efficient inorganic carbon transporters which could help in increasing the influx of inorganic carbon (Ci) at the site of CO2 fixation. We conducted a survey to find out the genes coding for cyanobacterial Ci transporters in 40 cyanobacterial phyla with respect to transporters present in Gloeobacter violaceous PCC 7421, an early-diverging cyanobacterium. An attempt was also made to correlate the prevalence of the kind of transporter present in the species with its habitat. Basically, two types of cyanobacterial inorganic carbon transporters exist, i.e. bicarbonate transporters and CO2-uptake systems. The transporters also show variation in context to their structure as some exist as single subunit proteins (BicA and SbtA), while others exist as multisubunit proteins (namely BCT1, NdhI(3) and NdhI(4)). The phylogeny and distribution of the former have been extensively studied and the present analysis provides an insight into the latter ones. The in silico analysis of the genes under study revealed that their distribution was greatly influenced by the habitat and major environmental changes such as the great oxidation event (GOE) in the course of their evolution.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0022-1333	0973-7731		WOS:000372660600013	27019438

Mass-energy balance equations are developed which relate the biomass energetic yield coefficient to sets of variables which may be determined experimentally. Organic substrate consumption, biomass production, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, heat evolution, and nitrogen consumption are considered as measured variables. Application of the balances using direct and indirect methods of yield coefficient estimation is illustrated using experimental results from the literature. Product formation is included in the balance equations and the effect of product formation on biomass yield estimates is examined.

The fine-tuning of Co/Mo ratios in the Co-Mo precursors realized by controlling the dosages of capping agent (urea), which enables CoO to grow along its (111) crystalline orientation and retard the incorporation of Mo-O. As a result, the optimized CoP/MOL/NF-10 exhibits the best hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with low overpotentials (eta) of 87 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). DFT calculation confirmed the O-site on surface is more advantageous to the adsorption of H, when CoP with proper mounts of Mo-O linkages and giving rise to a decent Delta G(H) value. When the CoP/MOL/NF-10 employed as anode for OER, the current density of 20 mA cm(-2) is achieved at a low overpotential of 270 mV. In the end, a symmetric electrolyzer built by CoP/MOL/NF-10 deliveries a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.52 V with excellent stability.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000502007800023		
J	Srivastava, A; Strasser, RJ; Govindjee				Govindjee, Govindjee/ABF-3362-2021				Differential effects of dimethylbenzoquinone and dichlorobenzoquinone on chlorophyll fluorescence transient in spinach thylakoids								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY				31	3			163	169		10.1016/1011-1344(95)07177-6				DEC 1995	1995	In isolated thylakoids, the differential effects of 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone (DMQ) and 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ) on chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transients and O-2 evolution data have been used to differentiate between active and inactive photosystem II (PSII) centers. This conclusion was challenged by Lavergne and Leci (Photosynth. Res., 35 (1993) 323-343). Thus we have systematically re-investigated this phenomenon using different concentrations of DMQ and DCBQ in thylakoids exposed to various light intensities. We show that the differential effects of DMQ and DCBQ on Chl a fluorescence transients in spinach thylakoids include a larger decrease in the variable Chl a fluorescence by DCBQ than by DMQ and a decrease in the F-0 level with increasing [DCBQ] but not [DMQ] in the 5-150 mu M range. These differential effects confirm the results of Lavergne and Leci, and thus sustain the conclusion that the effects of DMQ and DCBQ on Chl a fluorescence cannot be used to distinguish between active and inactive PSII centers. The data show that the decrease in Chl a fluorescence follows Stem-Volmer behavior. Furthermore, our data confirm that the rate of O-2 evolution is higher in the DCBQ-supported Hill reaction than in the DMQ-supported Hill reaction. These results can be explained by a more efficient ability of DCBQ to oxidize the plastoquinol pool or a more efficient ability of DCBQ to displace Q(B) (secondary bound plastoquinone, a two-electron acceptor of PSII), rather than activating the inactive PSII centers. However, our results do not challenge the existence of inactive PSII.									27	6	0	0	26	0	33			1011-1344			WOS:A1995TN27400010

In the evolution of photosynthesis from aquatic to terrestrial environments, the structure of PSII core complex was highly conserved while a variety of antenna forms became differentiated. In order to study the principles for energy transport from antenna to the PSII reaction center, we have explored whether the major light harvesting complex of PSII (LHCII) of higher plants can transfer energy to the cyanobacteria PSII core complexes (CC). For this purpose, LHCII from pea and CC from Thermosynechococcus vulcanus were isolated and co-reconstituted into liposome at LHCII:CC molar ratios of 2:1, 4:1 and 6:1, respectively. Chemical-cross linking followed by LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed the biochemical interaction between LHCII and CC in the liposome membrane. The analyses of 77 K fluorescence emission spectra and antenna cross section of PSII indicated that LHCII can transfer energy directly to the cyanobacterial CC. The study has laid the basis for further research on the mechanism of energy transfer from LHCII to PSII CC. This result may also open a new possibility for design and development of new artificial PSII in the application of solar energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0981-9428			WOS:000566818900016	32563040

Herein, using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the new InSe-XS2(X = Mo, W) vdW heterojunction. Our results indicate that InSe-MoS(2)and InSe-WS(2)vdW heterojunctions possess direct band gaps of 1.48 and 1.421 eV, respectively. The reduction/oxidation potentials of water are within the valence-band maximum (VBM) and the conduction-band minimum (CBM) (VBM/CBM) of the InSe-XS2(X = Mo, W) vdW heterojunctions, showing significant potential for photocatalytic applications. The band gaps and band edge positions of the computed heterojunctions in a neutral environment meet the requirement for water splitting. Moreover, the results for InSe-XS2(X = Mo, W) vdW heterojunctions show an enhanced optical absorption and suitable CBM positions with respect to the water potential reduction. Our results indicate that InSe-XS2(X = Mo, W) heterojunctions have stronger driving force for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, biaxial strain can effectively modify the band gap values. Outstanding visible and near-infrared light absorption abilities from similar to 400 to around 1400 nm guide the InSe-MoS(2)vdW heterojunction to promising applications in photovoltaics.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000572343400011

Toward unlocking the energy capabilities of this neotype energy storage system, noble metal-catalyzed high surface area carbon materials have been widely used as the 02 cathodes, and some of them exhibit excellent electrochemical performances in terms of round-trip efficiency and cycle life. However, whether these outstanding electrochemical performances are backed by the reversible formation/ decomposition of Li2O2, i.e., the desired Li-O-2 electrochemistry, remains unclear due to a lack of quantitative assays for the Li-O-2 cells. Here, noble metal (Ru and Pd)-catalyzed carbon nanotube (CNT) fabrics, prepared by magnetron sputtering, have been used as the O-2 cathode in aprotic Li-O-2 batteries. The catalyzed Li-O-2 cells exhibited considerably high round-trip efficiency and prolonged cycle life, which could match or even surpass some of the best literature results. However, a combined analysis using differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, revealed that these catalyzed Li-O-2 cells (particularly those based on Pd-CNT cathodes) did not work according to the desired Li-O-2 electrochemistry. Instead the presence of noble metal catalysts impaired the cells' reversibility, as evidenced by the decreased O-2 recovery efficiency (the ratio of the amount of O-2 evolved during recharge/that consumed in the preceding discharge) coupled with increased CO2 evolution during charging. The results reported here provide new insights into the O-2 electrochemistry in the aprotic Li-O-2 batteries containing noble metal catalysts and exemplified the importance of the quantitative assays for the Li-O-2 reactions in the course of pursuing truly rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries.									132	9	0	0	3	0	132			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000366339600045	26535791

Steel slag generated from the steel-making industry contains a high content of calcium oxide, which is a potential medium to sequestrate CO2 via the carbonation process. In this paper, the influence of reaction parameters including solid to liquid ratio, CO2 flow rate, temperature, volume of water and carbonation time on aqueous carbonation of basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS) in maximizing CO2 sequestration was determined. The structural and mineralogical changes of carbonated BOFS were also analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Using an optimized aqueous carbonation condition, about 16.35% of CO2 can be sequestered, which was obviously higher compared with dry carbonation (about 4.91%) at ambient conditions. Subsequently, the effect of replacing cement with carbonated BOFS (either by aqueous or dry route) on the micro-mechanical properties and hydration characteristics of blended cement paste was studied. The results demonstrated that as a small ratio of aqueous carbonated BOFS (10%-20%) blended in the cement paste they can accelerate the rate of early heat evolution during the first 24 h. On the contrary, as the carbonated BOFS ratio increased, the overall heat of hydration and mechanical strength were decreased. In comparison, BOFS carbonated by aqueous method is found to perform better in blended cement paste than its counterpart carbonated by dry method at the same replacement ratio due to the presence of a greater calcite content (acting as nucleation sites) in the aqueous carbonated BOFS.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0950-0618	1879-0526		WOS:000697478200004

Electrochemical oxidation of persistent organic pollutant wastewater perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was carried out with the novel PbO2 anode. Ti/TiO2-NTs/Ag2O/PbO2 anode exhibited a pyramid structure, which was the typical PbO2 electrodes prepared using electrochemical deposition method. XRD spectra indicated that diffraction peaks of PbO2 coating conformed to that of JCPDS (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards) card for beta-PbO2. Ti/TiO2-NTs/Ag2O/PbO2 anode showed high oxygen evolution potential, and longer life service, compared with Ti/PbO2 and Ti/TiO2-NTs/PbO2 anodes. The degradation ratio of PFOS (90 mL of 0.0929 mmol L (1)) was 74.87%, with a pseudo first-order kinetic constant of 0.0165 min (1) and a half-life of 43.18 min (1) at a constant current density of 30 mA cm (2) after 180 min of electrolysis. PFOS oxidation yielded sulfate, fluoride, and perfluorocarboxyl anions (i.e., C3F7COO , C4F9COO , C5F11COO , C6F13COO , and C7F15COO ). The electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrum confirmed that oxygen in the intermediate products originated from a heavy-oxygen water electrolyte, and the degradation of PFOS was initiated by the dissociation of a sulfonic group. A possible mechanism was revealed; that was, PFOS was desulfated at the anode to form C8F17 and then transformed into C8F17OH, followed by intramolecular rearrangement and hydrolysis reactions to form C7F15COO . Kolbe decarboxylation occurred in C7F15COO at the anode to generate C7F15 , which evolved into C6F13COO in a similar way and the CF2 unit fell off from C7F15COO . PFOS was gradually degraded into short-chain perfluorocarboxyl anions by repeating the CF2 unzipping cycle.

Detonation initiation was carried out by burning the mixture in the prechamber connected to the channel. To measure the velocity of a flame front, photodiodes installed along the axis of the channel were used. To determine the boundary conditions at the entrance to the channel, a piezoelectric pressure transducer was used. The influence of the dimensions of the prechamber and equivalence ratio on the pressure profile, and evolution of the flame front along the axis of the channel are presented. Effect of the prechamber detonation initiation in the channel has been analyzed. It was shown that the dynamics of the flame front and shock waves in the channel can occur in different scenarios depending on the geometry of the prechamber and equivalence ratio. The pre-detonation distances were determined.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000378527400008

S-0 and S-2 are paramagnetic, and can be monitored by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Recently a new EPR signal from the S-0 state was discovered [Ahrling et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 13148-13152, Messinger et al, (1997), J Ant. Chem. Sec. 119, 11349-11350]. Here, we present a well-resolved So spectrum, taken at high power and low temperature. The spectrum is wider and more resolved than previously thought, with structure over more than 2500 G, and appears to have at least 20 reproducible peaks on each side of g = 2. We also present the temperature dependence of the unsaturated S-0 signal amplitude. A linear relationship was found between signal intensity and reciprocal temperature (1/T) in the region 5-25 K, clearly extrapolating to 0. This obeys the Curie law, indicating that the S-0 state is a ground S = 1/2 state with no thermally accessible excited state. The data are consistent with a minimum energy gap of 30 cm(-1) between the ground and first excited states.									51	1	0	0	23	0	52			0006-2960			WOS:000074061600024	9609706

The present work reports on the use of a Cu2+-macrocycle, formed by the interaction of copper perchlorate hexahydrate with ethylenediamine and 1,4-bis(2-carboxyaldehyde phenoxy)butane, as precursors for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on anode. In alkaline solution, using potassium borate electrolyte (pH 12.0) as electrolyte, the catalytic onset potential was less than 0.80 V, reflecting an overpotential of 524 mV for a catalytic current density of 1 mA cm(-2). The OER activity was much higher when compared to Cu2+ (e.g., Cu(OAc)(2)), which converts under these conditions into OER inactive Cu(OH)(2) precipitate in solution. The interest of this complex is that it can be used as homogeneous OER catalyst but can be in addition electrochemically deposited on electrode materials, where it maintained its robust electrocatalytic activity for the OER. Surface-supported thin catalytic film was grown on glassy carbon and indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes upon the application of a potential of 1.1 V for 5 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicate the preferential formation of Cu2O. Remarkably, under applied anodic potential of 1.1 V vs SCE, the ITO/Cu2O anode efficiently catalyze water oxidation by evolving oxygen. The overpotential was determined as 400 mV vs NHE at 1 mA cm(-2). This anode maintained a current density of about 5.1 mA cm(-2) for 5 h with a recession of about 11%. In addition, the same ITO/Cu2O anode could be used for several OER experiments without loss of activity.									20	2	0	0	1	0	21			1932-7447			WOS:000440520500007

A detail characterization on the microstructures, element distribution and phase composition of the HVOF sprayed CoCrAlYTa-10%Al2O3 coating was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructural evolution and microhardness of the coating at different temperatures were investigated. The results showed that the coating had a dense and uniform microstructure with a low porosity of 0.44%. The primary phases for the CoCrAlYTa-10%Al2O3 coating were identified as Co-based solid solution, Cr-based solid solution, Al2O3 phase and TaC particles. Compounds such as Cr7C3, Al13Co4 and aluminum-yttrium oxides Al5Y3O12 were also confirmed by TEM observation results. Owing to the rapidly cooling rates of the molten droplets, nano-crystalline phase was existed in the coating. The average microhardness of the coating was 640 HV0.1. Its high microhardness derived from the presence of certain volume fraction of hard Al2O3, Cr7C3 and TaC grains within the coating. After 1h of oxidation, oxides like CrO2 and Ta2O5 were formed when the coating exposed at the temperature up to 800 degrees C. At the temperature above 600 degrees C, the hardness of the coating remained at a high level (600 HV0.1). It possessed better high temperature softening resistance than H13 steel, indicated that the coating exhibited good mechanical properties at high temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2053-1591		WOS:000520133800001

Herein, an ultrathin CoO layer containing Zn-dopants and O-vacancies (V-o-Zn-CoO) is designed as an archetype to explore the influence mechanism of Zn on O-vacancies in ultrathin nanolayer for CO2 photoreduction. DFT calculations illustrate that Zn-dopants not only reduce formation barriers of *COOH and *CO intermediates, but also form pi-back-bonding with *CO stimulating CH4 evolution. Finally, V-o-Zn-CoO layer significantly enhances CO2 photoreduction efficiency and CH4 selectivity with 26.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (63.8%) compared to 7.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (23.6%) for CoO layer with O-vacancies. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Zn and O-vacancies benefits the stability of O-vacancies in photocatalysts, achieving durable photocatalytic performance of V-o-Zn-CoO layer. This work manifests that the strategy of metal atoms synergistic O-vacancies is effective to optimize CO2 photocatalytic efficiency, selectivity, and stability of photocatalyst with O-vacancies.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000736089800001

It was found that as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400 to 700 degrees C, the char yield decreased from 45.10 to 33.79 wt.% and the higher heating value increased from 17.32 to 22.72 MJ/kg. The largest BET surface area (13 m(2)/g) was created at 500 degrees C. Hydrogen atoms were continuously lost during pyrolysis, whereas oxygen atoms were difficult to eliminate. Whewellite, calcite, lime, and quartz were the minerals in the chars, and their forms and crystallinity changed with changing pyrolysis temperature. Activated carbon with a BET surface area of 1023 m(2)/g and a total pore volume of 0.595 cm(3)/g was obtained from the char prepared at 500 degrees C. Its characteristics were studied by N-2-adsorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The pyrolysis and KOH-activation processes were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the pyrolysis of SMS occurred primarily between 217 and 375 degrees C and that the energies needed for the pyrolysis reactions were relatively low due to the prior mushroom cultivation. Furthermore, lignin was incompletely decomposed in the char prepared at 500 degrees C, and KOH suppressed tar evolution and reduced the energy needed to decompose the residual lignin during activation.									23	3	0	0	10	0	26			1930-2126			WOS:000344184300017

T. cruzi invasion and replication in cardiomyocytes induce cellular injuries and cytotoxic reactions, with the production of inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide, both source of reactive oxygen species. The myocyte response to oxidative stress involves the progression of cellular changes primarily targeting mitochondria. We studied the cardiac mitochondrial structure and the enzymatic activity of citrate synthase and respiratory chain CI-CIV complexes, in Albino Swiss mice infected with T. cruzi. Tulahuen strain and SGO Z12 isolate, in two periods of the acute infection. Changes in the mitochondrial structure were detected in both infected groups, reaching values of 71% for Tulahuen and 88% for SGO Z12 infected mice, 30 days post infection. The citrate synthase activity was different according to the evolution of the infection and the parasite strain, but the respiratory chain alterations were similar with either strain.

Lim, CT; Goh, JCH		Simulation of Tissue-Engineering Cell Cultures Using a Hybrid Model Combining a Differential Nutrient Equation and Cellular Automata								13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOLS 1-3		IFMBE Proceedings		23	1-3			1737	+						2009	2009	One of the potential therapeutic strategies in tissue engineering is to regenerate tissues from in vitro cell cultivations with porous scaffolds, and then implant the cellular-scaffold into patients suffering tissue defects. Tissues engineering is a multi-discipline composed of many subjects, for which quantification by means of mathematical modeling can interpret experimental results and identify dominating factors. In this paper we develop a hybrid mathematic model to simulate the in vitro cell cultures in tissue engineering. A discrete cellular automation model is used to treat the cell population dynamics affected by the biological phenomena of cell proliferation, aggregation, contact inhibition, nutrient-limited viability, and cell random walks. Cell growth rates are randomly taken using a gamma distribution with its mean value determined by the local oxygen concentration. The oxygen evolution in the scaffold is modeled by a differential diffusion-reaction equation, which is solved with a finite difference method. Simulations show for a uniform seeding case, increasing cell migration speed enhances the cell population to a maximum; however further increasing the migration speed turns to reduce the cell number. This is because cells with faster speeds move to the scaffold periphery and block the oxygen transfer toward the interior region, resulting in a nutrient limitation on the overall cell growth. We also test an artificial seeding condition where the same number of cells is initially seeded around the scaffold center. It is found cells in such a case proliferate slowly for a longer time compared with the case of uniform seeding, and ultimately reach a higher cell population as the nutrient limitation is avoided to some extent. The model offers an effective method to assess the cell population dynamics, and the simulation results can provide a design reference for tissue engineering applications.					13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)13th International Conference on Biomedical Engineering (ICBME)	DEC 03-06, 2008DEC 03-06, 2008	AMTI; BES Technol; ESLSYS; VICON; INSTRON; Process Engn Publishing; Wiley BlackwellAMTI; BES Technol; ESLSYS; VICON; INSTRON; Process Engn Publishing; Wiley Blackwell	Singapore, SINGAPORESingapore, SINGAPORE	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-0737		978-3-540-92840-9	WOS:000268245600431

A stoichiometric Hydrogen/Oxygen mixture with different diluents (Argon and Nitrogen) is considered to assess effects of the mixture composition and reactivity on the initiation process. It is found that the mixture reactivity and the spatio-temporal evolution of the diffracted detonation wave are critical in controlling the development of the ignition kernels, and the possible transition to detonation. Due to curvature effects and the increasing shock angle, the incident shock wave transitions from a regular reflection to a Mach reflection. Through parametric studies, it is shown that for more reactive Argon-diluted mixtures, ignition first appears behind the regular shock reflection, which is followed by spontaneous re-initiation through the SWACER (Shock Wave Amplification by Coherent Energy Release) mechanism. By replacing Argon with Nitrogen, the reactivity reduces and reignition through Mach reflection is observed. The subsequent re-initiation is primarily controlled by flame-acoustic and wave-wave interactions. Hot-spot re-initiation behind the Mach stem is not found due to the short ignition window that exists over the limited range of shock angles. A theoretical model is developed to confirm these findings and to quantify the coupling among the incident shock angle, the thermodynamic state of the shock-compressed mixture, and the ignition delay. Effects of viscous-diffusive transport are also assessed, and it is shown that the viscous dissipation at the wall promotes ignition and transition to re-initiation.

The dynamic conditions inside a working battery had not been intensively explored until the advent of various in situ characterization techniques. Real-time transmission electron microscopy of electrochemical reactions is one of the most significant breakthroughs poised to enable radical shift in our knowledge on how materials behave in the electrochemical environment. This review, therefore, summarizes the scientific discoveries enabled by in situ transmission electron microscopy, and specifically emphasizes the applicability of this technique to address the critical challenges in the rechargeable ion battery electrodes, electrolyte and their interfaces. New electrochemical systems such as lithium-oxygen, lithium-sulfur and sodium ion batteries are included, considering the rapidly increasing application of in situ transmission electron microscopy in these areas. A systematic comparison between lithium ion-based electrochemistry and sodium ion-based electrochemistry is also given in terms of their thermodynamic and kinetic differences. The effect of the electron beam on the validity of in situ observation is also covered. This review concludes by providing a renewed perspective for the future directions of in situ transmission electron microscopy in rechargeable ion batteries.									218	10	0	0	12	0	219			2041-1723			WOS:000408377400001		
J	Sazou, Dimitra; Saltidou, Kyriaki; Pagitsas, Michael								Understanding the effect of bromides on the stability of titanium oxide films based on a point defect model								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				76				48	61		10.1016/j.electacta.2012.04.158				AUG 1 2012	2012	The effect of donor density, N-D On the critical localized breakdown potential, E-b Of the passivity on Ti was investigated in bromide-containing aqueous solutions. Oxide films of approximately fixed thickness were galvanostatically grown on Ti in 0.5 M H2SO4 at various current densities. The N-D was estimated using Mott-Schottky analysis. The stable localized breakdown induced by bromides manifested itself in potentiodynamic current-potential curves by a sudden current increase at E-b. The passive film on Ti is n-type and oxygen vacancies were considered as majority defects. The E-b tends to decrease as the oxygen vacancy and bromide concentration increases. Additionally, the E-b of anodically grown films was found to increase with the potential scan rate, inversely of the behavior observed for the native oxide on Ti, but in concert with corresponding relationships followed by other metals/alloys and predicted by the point defect model (PDM). Physico-electrochemical processes leading to growth and breakdown of passivity on Ti can be understood in terms of a PDM. The higher susceptibility of titanium oxide to local breakdown in presence of bromides than chlorides is interpreted by considering electrochemical reactions occurring at the TiO2 vertical bar solution interface and their effect on film surface and bulk properties upon increasing the potential during the positive-going potential scan. Finally, it should be noted that a further understanding on the mechanism of bromide-induced passivity breakdown on Ti might be useful to achieve optimized anodization conditions for ordered oxide nanostructures with desired properties in electrolytes other than fluorides and perhaps at lower anodization potentials.

An increasing number of studies indicated that immune genes of Tibetan endemic fish species underwent positive selection towards functional shift, while the insight into immune gene repertoire of Tibetan highland fishes from genome-wide studies has largely lagged behind. In this study, we performed one of the first comparative genomics study in particular focusing on the signatures of immune genes in a highland fish, Gymnocypris przewalskii based on immune-relevant tissue transcriptome assemblies. We identified seven putative rapidly evolving immune genes with elevated molecular evolutionary rate (dN/dS) relative to lowland fish species. Using tissue-transcriptome data, we found most of rapidly evolving immune genes were broadly expressed in head-kidney, spleen, gills and skin tissues, which significantly enriched for complement activation and inflammatory response processes. In addition, we found a set of complement activation related genes underwent accelerated evolution and showed consistently repressed expression patterns in response to parasite Ichthyophthirius multifiliis infection. Moreover, we detected a number of immune genes involved in adaptive immune system exhibited distinct signature of upregulated expression patterns after parasite infection. Taken together, this study provided putative transcriptomic signatures of rapidly evolving immune genes, and will gain the insight into Schizothoracine fish adaptation to high-altitude extreme aquatic environments including diversified pathogen challenge.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1050-4648	1095-9947		WOS:000513983700062	31891809

However, the effect of vacancies especially the role of cation vacancies in LDH has not been well illustrated. In this study, NiFe-LDH with Ni(II) vacancies (NiFe-LDH-V-Ni) or Fe (III) vacancies (NiFe-LDH-V-Fe) were fabricated via defect-engineering to tune catalytic activity on PS activation for tetracycline (TC) degradation. Characterizations of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy confirmed cation vacancies were successfully implanted in NiFe-LDH catalyst. Experiments demonstrated that cation vacancies enhance the catalytic performance while NiFe-LDH-V-Ni exhibited better activation performance since vacancies could facilitate the electron transfer, thereby forming more reactive oxygen species. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations disclosed that the NiFe-LDH with Ni(II) or Fe(III) vacancies possessed larger surface energy, lower Fermi energy and more positive Mulliken atomic charges than bare NiFe-LDH. About 80% of 30 mg.L-1 TC could be mineralized through the catalysis of NiFe-LDH-V-Ni/PS system in 90 min. Furthermore, quenching experiments confirmed that the SO4-center dot & nbsp;and (OH)-O-center dot generated by interface reaction accounted for the TC degradation. O-1(2) and O-2(-center dot)& nbsp;species were also identified in the presence of oxygen vacancies through nitrogen gas cleaning experiments. Ultimately, a possible mechanism of TC degradation was proposed in NiFe-LDH/PS system with Ni(II) or Fe(III) vacancies. This study provides a possible guideline to discover the appropriate cation vacancies that contribute to the activation process and also provides a strategy to rationally design high-activity catalysts based on defect engineering.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000781653900003

For the conversion without addition of < Zn > and < Al > the yield of volatile and liquid products was 3.1 and 47.3%, respectively, in relation to the weight of bitumen. As a result of a chemical interaction of H2O molecules with bitumen, oxygen atoms appeared in these products and conversion residue; the amount of hydrogen in them being increased. When < Zn > or < Al > was added, the conversion and hydrogenation of bitumen significantly increased owing to hydrogen evolution during the oxidation of metals by SCW. This oxidation via the synthesis of ZnO and Al2O3 nanoparticles was accompanied by on-site heating of reactants. Moreover, when adding < Zn > and < Al > into bitumen, the yield of the volatile products increased up to 15.3 and 38.2%, respectively. The addition of < Zn > resulted in the yield increase of the liquid products up to 62.3%, of the resins up to 33.5%, the content of oxygen in the products being increased too. While the addition of < Al > resulted in the yield decrease of the resins up to 7.5% and the yield increase of the oil up to 36.1%, no oxygen atoms in the structure of the liquid products being detected. A portion of sulfur was removed from bitumen via the SCW conversion with addition of < Zn > in terms of the ZnO + H2S = ZnS + H2O reaction. These and other peculiarities of the conversion and hydrogenation of bitumen in situ are reported in the present paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Fluctuations of light, temperature, and changing concentrations of the various reducible substrates pose unique regulatory problems to photoautotrophic plant cells. Covalent redox modification of enzyme proteins as mediated by the ferredoxin/thioredoxin-system is suited to provide short-term adaptation of various enzymatic activities in the chloroplast. This mode of regulation is based on the continuous turnover of interconvertible enzyme forms, as in the systems driven by protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, but is particularly adapted to the unique conditions of a compartment performing oxygenic photosynthesis by depending on the simultaneous presence of reducing power and of oxygen. Individual fine control of each of the enzymes subjected to redox modification is achieved by specific metabolites acting as additional positive or negative effectors of the reductive (and/or oxidative) modification reaction. The biochemical prerequisite for such a control is the presence of regulatory (extra) sequences carrying cysteine residues which are subjected to reversible redox changes. Although no common amino acid sequence has yet been identified among the known regulatory peptides, in all cases the evolution of autotrophy should be related to the presence of extrasequences in otherwise very conserved enzyme molecules.									157	3	3	0	148	0	165			0032-0889			WOS:A1991FN15700001	16668135

Ethane has been detected across the solar system, from the atmosphere of the giant planets and the surface of Saturn's satellite Titan to various comets and TNOs. To date, there were no experiments focused on icy mixtures of C2H6 and H2O exposed to ion irradiation simulating cosmic rays, a case study for many astronomical environments in which C2H6 has been detected. In this work, the radiolysis of a C2H6: H2O (2:3) ice mixture bombarded by a 40 (MeVNi11+)-Ni-58 ion beam is studied. The chemical evolution of the molecular species existing in the sample is monitored by a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The analysis of ethane, water, and molecular products in solid phase was performed. Induced chemical reactions in C2H6:H2O ice produce 13 daughter molecular species. Their formation and dissociation cross sections are determined. Furthermore, atomic carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen budgets are determined and used to verify the stoichiometry of the most abundantly formed molecular species. The results are discussed in the view of solar system and interstellar medium chemistry. The study presented here should be regarded as a first step in laboratory works dedicated to simulate the effect of cosmic radiation on multicomponent mixtures involving C2H6 and H2O.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000381912800017

The thin films were deposited at different pressures and temperatures, so as to determine the optimized growth parameter for the good quality BCT thin films. The pressure variation on the growth parameters made a dramatic impact in tailoring the dielectric constant and phase transition. The phase evolution of the BCT thin films evolves from 450degreesC and at higher substrate temperatures (similar to700degreesC) for different partial pressures of oxygen, the preferred orientation of the thin films were observed. The SIMS analysis reveals a sharp interface exist at the bottom electrode (Pt)-BCT thin films indicating no interdiffusion taking place which might lead to the degradation of devices. The BCT thin films deposited at higher pressures (>60 mtorr) exhibited higher Ba content indicating the possibility of the Ca occupying the Ti site and is reflected in the decrease of the dielectric phase transition temperature.

However, these two features have rarely been achieved together. Herein, we report the preparation of single-crystalline CoO hexagrams and demonstrate their exceptional electrocatalytic properties for water oxidation. The quasi-single-crystalline CoO hexagrams, prepared at the critical phase transition point of -Co(OH)(2)/Co(OH)F hexagrams, possess both abundant oxygen vacancies as defects and structural long-range ordering. The matching between the b-axis of Co(OH)F crystals and the a-axis of -Co(OH)(2) crystals is critical for the formation of the CoO hexagram single crystals. The quasi-single-crystalline CoO hexagrams with abundant defects are highly efficient for water oxidation by delivering a 10 mA cm(-2) current density at a low overpotential of 269 mV in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution.									44	7	0	0	3	0	46			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000444554100010	30210770

Redox processes are at the foundation of nearly all aspects of biology. Free radicals, related oxidants, and antioxidants are central to the basic functioning of cells and tissues. They set the cellular redox environment and, therefore, are the key to regulation of biochemical pathways and networks, thereby influencing organism health. To understand how short-lived, quasi-stable species, such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide, connect to the metabolome, proteome, lipidome, and genome we need absolute quantitative information on all redox active compounds as well as thermodynamic and kinetic information on their reactions, i.e., knowledge of the complete redoxome. Central to the state of the redoxome are the interactive details of the superoxide/peroxide formation and removal systems. Quantitative information is essential to establish the dynamic mathematical models needed to reveal the temporal evolution of biochemical pathways and networks. This new field of Quantitative Redox Biology will allow researchers to identify new targets for intervention to advance our efforts to achieve optimal human health.									51	2	1	0	39	0	53			1085-9195	1559-0283		WOS:000326282900025	22161621

The presence of C(18)O(16)O (m/z=46) during the anodic polarization clearly proves that the IrO(2) participated in the oxidation of the formic acid. Analysis of the experimental data showed that at maximum 3.7% of the surface IrO(2) participated in the exchange of oxygen between electrogenerated labeled IrO(3) (Ir(16)O(16)O(18)O) and adsorbed formic acid (HC(16)O(16)OH), producing carbon dioxide (C(16)O(18)O) and Ir(16)O(2).

Recently, tremendous efforts have been made in this field. Herein, we discuss some general design principles of electrochemical devices for the conversion of biomass-derived intermediates. We primarily focus on the review of electro-valorisation of glycerol and also summarize the most recent advances in electrochemical conversion of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural (HMF) through oxidation. We emphasize the role of both precious and non-precious metal electrocatalysts in electrocatalytic conversion in various practical electrochemical reactors and how to avoid competing reactions such as hydrogen evolution. We also provide a perspective on future opportunities and challenges in this field, including catalytic materials discovery, mechanism understanding, and system design.									74	8	0	0	2	0	78			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000437183200001

By engineering both electrocatalyst and electrolyzer to simultaneously regulate chemical kinetics and thermodynamic driving forces of the electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR), we report herein stereoconfinement-induced densely populated metal single atoms (Rh, Ru, Co) on graphdiyne (GDY) matrix (formulated as M SA/GDY) and realized a boosted ENRR activity in a pressurized reaction system. Remarkably, under the pressurized environment, the hydrogen evolution reaction of M SA/GDY was effectively suppressed and the desired ENRR activity was strongly amplificated. As a result, the pressurized ENRR activity of Rh SA/GDY at 55 atm exhibited a record-high NH3 formation rate of 74.15 mu g h(-1)cm(-2), a Faraday efficiency of 20.36%, and a NH3 partial current of 0.35 mA cm(-2) at -0.20 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which, respectively, displayed 7.3-, 4.9-, and 9.2-fold enhancements compared with those obtained under ambient conditions. Furthermore, a time-independent ammonia yield rate using purified N-15(2) confirmed the concrete ammonia electroproduction. Theoretical calculations reveal that the driving force for the formation of end-on N2* on Rh SA/GDY increased by 9.62 kJ/mol under the pressurized conditions, facilitating the ENRR process. We envisage that the cooperative regulations of catalysts and electrochemical devices open up the possibilities for industrially viable electrochemical ammonia production.									43	2	0	0	4	0	43			0027-8424			WOS:000593967200008	33172992

NiFe2O4 inhibit the photoreduction of Ag3PO4 into Ag and resulted in high stability. The photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4/Ag/NiFe2O4 samples was studied by methylene blue degrading under visible light irradiation. The Ag3PO4/Ag/NiFe2O4 photo catalyst with NiFe2O4 loading of 3% revealed good photocatalytic performance, high stability and quick degradation after 5 cycles. Photoluminescence spectra and photocurrent tests demonstrated that the formation of hetero-junction facilitated the separation of photo-generated carriers. The trapping experiments confirmed that h(+) and center dot OH were active species during the degradation process. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, exposed Fe species are susceptible to sintering and coking, which lead to deactivation. Here, we demonstrate that Fe nanoparticles encapsulated in pod-like carbon nanotubes (Pod-Fe) can be used as an efficient Fischer-Tropsch catalyst to produce light olefins. It gave a higher selectivity of light olefins (45%) and high stability over 120 h reaction (P = 0.5 MPa, T = 320 degrees C, CO:H-2 = 1:2, gas hourly space velocity = 3500 h(-1)). A catalyst with exposed Fe particles on the outside of the Pod-Fe (FeOx/Pod-Fe) catalyst showed a selectivity of light olefins of 42%, but had a significantly lower stability due to the agglomeration of Fe nanoparticles and carbon deposition. These results indicated that the graphene shell of Pod-Fe played an important role in protecting the Fe particles and provided a rational way to enhance the activity and stability of Fe-based catalysts in high temperature reactions.

TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2-NTs) after Sb and Sn electrodeposited were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). In contrast with the traditional Sb-doped SnO2 coating prepared by thermal decomposition, the Sb-doped SnO2 coating prepared by electrodeposition processes show more compact. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis indicates that the Sb-doped SnO2 coating prepared by electrodeposition processes are firmly combined with the TiO2-NTs formed on the Ti substrate. Accelerated service life tests reveal that the electrodeposition processes enhance the electrochemical stability of the Sb-doped SnO2 electrode. The cyclic voltammetry analysis shows that TiO2-NTs/SnO2-Sb electrodes have higher overpotential for oxygen evolution and higher electrochemical porosity. Besides, the enhanced stabilization mechanism of the TiO2-NTs/SnO2-Sb electrode prepared by electrodeposition processes has been studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, an Ir3Sn-CeO2/C heterogeneous catalyst is designed as low-price, alternative Pt-free electrocatalyst towards ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) in acidic conditions. Owing to the strong synergistic effect among Ir, Sn and CeO2 components, Ir3Sn-CeO2/C heterogeneous catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activity and stability for EOR in comparison with commercial Pt/C, as prepared Ir/C and Ir3Sn/C. Additionally, kinetics and mechanisms of EOR are also investigated. It proves that ethanol electrooxidation on Ir3Sn-CeO2W/C catalyst is a diffusion controlled irreversible process. Meanwhile, the H2SO4 and ethanol concentrations can affect the EOR activity. All results demonstrate Ir3Sn-CeO2/C heterogeneous catalyst is a promising Pt-free choice for EOR.

But its short service life limits its large-scale application in industry. Electro-catalytic degradation performances and service life of the electrode can be significantly improved by doping rare earth (RE) ions into the oxide coating of Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes doped with different RE elements (Ce, Dy, La, and Eu) were prepared by the thermal decomposition method at 550 degrees C. Electro-catalytic degradation performances of electrodes doped with different RE elements were evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel curves. During the electrolysis, the conversion of p-nitrophenol was performed with these electrodes as anodes under galvanostatic control. The structures and morphologies of the surface coating of the electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results demonstrate that the electro-catalytic degradation performances of Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes are improved to different levels by doping different RE ions. Improved Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes by the introduction of different RE have higher oxygen evolution potential, better electro-catalysis ability, better coverage, and longer electrode life.									17	2	0	0	2	0	18			1001-0521	1867-7185		WOS:000374572800010

The relationships of subsolidus recrystallisation to the structure of the Earth at several scales, to tectonic processes, and to planetary evolution were virtually unknown. Rapid strides were about to be made, thanks to substantial increases in governmental support of research, and to the resultant technological advances in. mineralogy, petrology, and geochemistry; the heightened activity went hand-in-hand with larger scale revolutions in thinking due to the advent of plate tectonic concepts, planetological information provided by space exploration, and comparative studies of metamorphic terranes around the world.Experimental phase equilibrium and calorimetric studies, laboratory-calibrated stable isotope fractionations, and synthetically determined exchange reactions subsequently allowed thermobarometric methods to be employed for a broad range of metabasaltic parageneses, and the erection of a quantitative petrogenetic grid. Coupled with computed thermal models for divergent and convergent lithospheric plate boundaries as well as stable plate interiors, it became possible to estimate the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of metamorphic assemblages for both oceanic and continental crustal regimes. Mineral parageneses in ophiolites, oceanic spreading centres, back-arc basins, and geothermal districts are now reasonably well known. So are phase assemblages in subducted metabasalts. However, inclusions of coesite and diamond in garnet at four disparate Eurasian sites, indicate that initially shallow portions of the continental crust have been taken to depths exceeding 100 km, then returned to the surface by as yet poorly understood processes. The deepest portions of continental interiors are still not well characterised.Continuing advances in instrumentation now allow the quantitative documentation of mineral paragenetic, thermobarometric, and age relationships in recrystallised mafic volcanics and their intrusive equivalents. Investigations of reaction rates, transformation mechanisms, and clay-mineral generation are in their infancy, as is the study of fluid-basalt interaction. All of these lines of research assume increasing importance as nations and institutions begin to focus their intellectual resources on global habitability, environmental change, and technological capability.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0028-8306			WOS:A1993MH19900001		
J	Billaud, C; Nicolas, J								Main oxidoreductases involved in the malting and brewing technological processes.								SCIENCES DES ALIMENTS				21	2			83	131		10.3166/sda.21.83-131				2001	2001	Organoleptic quality of beer during storage can be dramatically altered as a result of chemical and/or enzymatic oxidation of endogenous polyunsaturated lipids and phenolic compounds originating from brewery barley. Enzymatic-mediated oxidative reactions can take place during different stages of the process, viz barley germination, malt kilning and at the beginning of mashing. In this respect, the action of oxidoreductases can lead to flavour deterioration resulting in the development of staling and off-flavours, occurrence of haze, modification of bitterness and astringency, as well as a modification of the colour of the processed product. This review is undertaken to get a better knowledge on the relative importance of five oxidoreductases in beer deterioration. As a matter of fact, superoxide dismutase is one of the most important antioxidative enzymes which protects the medium from superoxide radicals by catalyzing the dismutation of O-.(2)- into molecular oxygen and H2O2. The action of this oxidoreductase can next be relayed by catalase. This latter, by speeding up the dismutation of H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, may constitute an in situ primary antioxidant system. Polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase are able to catalyze the O-2 or H2O2-mediated oxidation of endogenous polyphenols in reactive quinonic compounds and give rise to secondary oxidations altering the quality of beer. Moreover, peroxidase is also susceptible to realize oxidative cross-linking between proteins and/or soluble pentosans and, consequently, may hinder lautering and filterability of beer. Lastly, lipoxygenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of polyunsaturated free fatty acids, is mostly responsible for the production of volatile aldehydes such as trans 2-nonenal, originating from 9-hydroperoxide, widely suspected of leading to staling of beer. In this respect, the main biochemical characteristics of oxidoreductases and some of their physico-chemical properties will be first summarized; thereafter, the effects of these enzymatic reactions during the processing, from barley to beer, will be described, with a special attention for the evolution of oxidoreductases; activity as well as some possible interventions of these oxidoreductases on organoleptic and rheological properties of mash and beer during the technological process.									5	2	0	0	6	0	8			0240-8813	2116-5912		WOS:000170184100001

Defect engineering is an important strategy for modulating the electronic properties of electrocatalysts, which may endow unexpected physical and chemical properties to break the intrinsic bottleneck and, therefore, boost the electrocatalytic performance. To date, various defective nanomaterials (such as nanocarbon and transition metal compounds) have been synthesized that display great potential for the CRR and NRR. Therefore, a deep understanding of the influence of defects on the catalytic activity is urgently needed. In this review, the type, regulation strategy, fine defect characterization methods, and their application in the electrocatalytic CRR and NRR are discussed and summarized. Furthermore, the major challenges, opportunities, and future development direction of defect engineering in CRR and NRR catalysts are proposed. This review aims to provide a reference for the proof-of-concept design of highly active CRR and NRR electrocatalysts.									302	36	0	0	14	0	307			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000471283100001

Metal ions in life sciences				15				13	43		10.1007/978-3-319-12415-5_2				2015	2015	Oxygen, that supports all aerobic life, is abundant in the atmosphere because of its constant regeneration by photosynthetic water oxidation, which is catalyzed by a Mn₄CaO₅ cluster in photosystem II (PS II), a multi subunit membrane protein complex. X-ray and other spectroscopy studies of the electronic and geometric structure of the Mn₄CaO₅ cluster as it advances through the intermediate states have been important for understanding the mechanism of water oxidation. The results and interpretations, especially from X-ray spectroscopy studies, regarding the geometric and electronic structure and the changes as the system proceeds through the catalytic cycle will be summarized in this review. This review will also include newer methodologies in time-resolved X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy that have become available since the commissioning of the X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) and are being applied to study the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). The femtosecond X-ray pulses of the XFEL allows us to outrun X-ray damage at room temperature, and the time-evolution of the photo-induced reaction can be probed using a visible laser-pump followed by the X-ray-probe pulse. XFELs can be used to simultaneously determine the light-induced protein dynamics using crystallography and the local chemistry that occurs at the catalytic center using X-ray spectroscopy under functional conditions. Membrane inlet mass spectrometry has been important for providing direct information about the exchange of substrate water molecules, which has a direct bearing on the mechanism of water oxidation. Moreover, it has been indispensable for the time-resolved X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy studies and will be briefly reviewed in this chapter. Given the role of PS II in maintaining life in the biosphere and the future vision of a renewable energy economy, understanding the structure and mechanism of the photosynthetic water oxidation catalyst is an important goal for the future.									5	0	0	0	2	0	5			1559-0836			MEDLINE:25707465	25707465

The meteorite consists of rounded polycrystalline olivine clasts (35%), pores (8%), and microcrystalline matrix (57%). Clasts and matrix have oxygen isotopic values and chemical compositions (major and trace elements) characteristic of the ureilite group. The matrix contains olivine (Fo(83-90)), low-Ca pyroxene (En(84-92)Wo(0-5)), augite (En(71-56)Wo(20-31)), graphite, diamond, Fe-metal, sulfides, chromite, and felsic glass. Pores are partly filled by secondary Fe-oxihydroxide and desert alteration products. Pores are surrounded by strongly reduced silicates. Clasts consist of fine-grained aggregates of polygonal olivine. These clasts have an approximately 250 mu m wide reaction rim, in which olivine composition evolves progressively from the core composition (Fo(79-81)) to the matrix composition (Fo(84-87)). Veins crossing the clasts comprise pyroxene, Fe-oxihydroxide, C-phases, and chromite. Clasts contain Ca-, Al-, and Cr-rich glass along olivine grain boundaries (< 1 mu m wide). We suggest that a significant portion of JaH 422, including olivine and all the pyroxenes, was molten as a result of an impact. In comparison with other impact-melted ureilites, JaH 422 shows the highest melt portion. Based on textural and compositional considerations, clasts and matrix probably originated from the same protolith, with the clasts representing relict olivine that survived, but was recrystallized in the impact melt. During the melt stage, the high availability of FeO and elevated temperatures controlled oxygen fugacity at values high enough to stabilize olivine with Fo(similar to 83-87) and chromite. Along pores, high Mg# compositions of silicates indicate that in a late stage or after melt crystallization FeO became less available and fO(2) conditions were controlled by C-CO + CO2.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000287247900009

However, the PEC performance of BiVO4 based photoanodes is usually dragged down by the poor charge transport and slow kinetics for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, a novel composite photoanode of Ti3C2TX/BiVO4 was fabricated for the first time by spin coating thin Ti3C2TX (MXene) flakes onto the surface of a BiVO4 film grown on the FTO substrate. A facile re-annealing treatment of bare BiVO4/FTO photoanode in argon can impressively boost the photocurrent density from 2.1 mA cm(-2) up to 2.95 mA cm(-2). Experimentally, we clearly elucidated that by re-annealing, the interfacial (BiVO4/FTO) charge recombination could be effectively suppressed due to the better contact between the BiVO4 film and FTO. The coating of thin Ti3C2TX flakes onto the BiVO4 film would further increase the photocurrent density to 3.45 mA cm(-2) (measured at 1.23 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under 1 sun illumination), exhibiting a photoconversion efficiency of 0.78% and a surface charge separation efficiency of 73%. The outstanding PEC performance can be mainly ascribed to the coating of the thin Ti3C2TX (MXene) flakes which function as co-catalysts, facilitating the charge transfer of the photogenerated carriers and reducing the charge recombination on the BiVO4 surface. Our findings provide a facile re-annealing strategy and a novel two-dimensional (2D) material of Ti3C2TX (MXene) as co-catalysts to improve the performance of the BiVO4 photoanode for PEC water oxidation.									40	0	0	0	6	0	40			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000457096400084

In addition, the dynamic changes between light reaction and carbon assimilation were also discussed. The results indicated that the photosynthetic rate of sun leaves and the photochemical rate of photosystem Ⅱ（PSⅡ） for shade leaves were very low in winter. Meanwhile, photosynthetic electron transport was blocked. Under the stress of low temperature and high light, photoinhabition of sun leaves was more serious than that of shade leaves. Excessive excitation energy was reduced due to the winter. PSⅡmaintained high opening degree damage of light-harvesting antenna to decrease the harm of excitation energy to the centre of PSⅡ Nonlinear electron transport and heat dissipation except for the antenna system were also important photoprotection ways for E. japonicus in winter. Consequently, activity of light-harvesting antenna system as well as that of photosynthetic chain and photosynthetic rate recovered gradually as air temperature rising in early spring. But photoinhabition would take place again when low temperature happened in late spring.			该文利用调制式荧光仪与氧电极技术,研究北京地区大叶黄杨在春初返青过程中的荧光动力学及光合放氧的变化,探讨常绿阔叶植物在北方越冬过程中抵御逆境的适应机制,同时借助稳态荧光动力学曲线的变化揭示植物返青过程光暗反应的动态变化。结果表明：冬季大叶黄杨阳生叶与阴生叶的PSⅡ光化学效率、光合速率均很低;光合电子传递不通畅,低温强光双重胁迫导致阳生叶比阴生叶的电子链阻塞更严重;捕光天线系统遭遇破坏,这是植物减少过多激发能对PSⅡ反应中心破坏的一种光保护机制;PSⅡ保持较高的开放程度,借此减小激发能在供体侧积累对反应中心造成的伤害;同时非线性电子传递和天线系统之外的能量耗散是大叶黄杨越冬过程重要的光保护机制。初春随着温度的回升,捕光天线系统、光合电子链的活性、光合速率逐渐恢复。倒春寒发生时,大叶黄杨再次发生光抑制现象。						0	5	0	0	1	0	5			1000-1522			CSCD:3452713

In this paper, we introduce PdFeCoNiCu high-entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles as an efficient electrocatalyst for the HER, which has been prepared in an oil phase under facile conditions for the first time. PdFeCoNiCu/C shows excellent alkaline HER catalytic performance with an overpotential of only 18 mV and a Tafel slope of 39 mV dec(-1). Meanwhile, we achieved the highest mass activity (6.51 A mg(Pd)(-1) at -0.07 V vs. RHE) in the alkaline HER among all non-Pt electrocatalysts. PdFeCoNiCu/C also shows surprisingly stable catalytic properties for over 15 days without notable decay. Based on theoretical calculations, the HEA surface demonstrates the optimization of electronic structures based on a synergistic effect between all metals. Pd and Co are confirmed to be the dominant electroactive sites for both H-2 formation and initial water splitting, which are assisted by Ni, Fe, and Cu promotion, enhancing electron transfer and optimizing the binding energies of hydrogen intermediates. This work has supplied significant insight into the design of an efficient electrocatalyst based on HEA materials.									28	3	0	0	0	0	29			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500011

Geothermobarometric calculations using measured mineral compositions in Perple_X allowed the construction of a P-T path showing a steep, cool prograde metamorphic gradient of 2 degrees C/km to reach peak conditions of 5.8 GPa and 890 degrees C for the kyanite eclogite. The kyanite-out reaction formed bimineralic eclogite and is probably an integral part of the mineralogical evolution of most archetypal bimineralic eclogites at Roberts Victor and potentially elsewhere. The kyanite-out reaction occured at close to peak pressure (5.3 GPa) and was associated with a rise in temperature to 1380 degrees C. Mass balance calculations show that upon breakdown, the kyanite component is fully accommodated in garnet and omphacite via a reaction system with low water fugacity that required restricted fluid influx from metasomatic sources. The delta O-18 values of garnets are consistently higher than normal mantle values. Each sample has its characteristic trend of delta O-18 variance between garnets in the kyanite-bearing sections and those in the bimineralic parts covering a range between 5.1% and 6.8%. No systematic change in O-isotope signature exists across the sample population. Differences in garnet trace element signatures between differing lithologies in the eclogites are significant. Grossular-rich garnets coexisting with kyanite have strong positive Eu-anomalies and low Gd/Yb ratios, while more pyrope-rich garnets in the bimineralic sections have lost their positive Eu-anomaly, have higher Gd/Yb ratios and generally higher heavy rare earth element contents. Garnets in the original kyanite-bearing portions thus reflect the provenance of the rocks as metamorphosed gabbros/troctolites. The kyanite-out reaction was most likely triggered by a heating event in the subcratonic lithosphere. As kyanite contains around 100 ppm of H2O it is suggested that the kyanite-out reaction, once initiated by heating and restricted metasomatic influx, was promoted by the release of water contained in the kyanite. The steep (high-P low-T) prograde P-T path defining rapid compression at low heating rates is atypical for subduction transport of eclogites into the lithospheric mantle. Such a trajectory is best explained in a model where strong lateral compression forces eclogites downward to higher pressures, supporting models of cratonic lithosphere formation by lateral collision and compression.

Here we present the results of a survey with more than 200 simulations systematically scanning the white dwarf binary parameter space. We consider white dwarf masses ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 M? and account for their different chemical compositions. We find excellent agreement with the orbital evolution predicted by mass transfer stability analysis. Much of our effort in this paper is dedicated to determining which binary systems are prone to a thermonuclear explosion just prior to merger or at surface contact. We find that a large fraction of He-accreting binary systems explode: all dynamically unstable systems with accretor masses below 1.1 M? and donor masses above similar to 0.4 M? are found to trigger a helium detonation at surface contact. A substantial fraction of these systems could explode at earlier times via detonations induced by instabilities in the accretion stream, as we have demonstrated in our previous work. We do not find definitive evidence for an explosion prior to merger or at surface contact in any of the studied double carbonoxygen systems. Although we cannot exclude their occurrence if some helium is present, the available parameter space for a successful detonation in a white dwarf binary of pure carbonoxygen composition is small. We demonstrate that a wide variety of dynamically unstable systems are viable Type Ia candidates. The next decade thus holds enormous promise for the study of these events, in particular with the advent of wide-field synoptic surveys allowing a detailed characterization of their explosive properties.									77	2	0	0	1	0	77			0035-8711			WOS:000303858400046

The PTL allows transporting the reactant water to the anode and cathode CLs, removing produced oxygen gas and providing good electrical conductivity for effective electron conduction. This calls for an optimized microstructure for PTLs to ensure stable electrochemical performance of PEMWEs. In this review, efforts are made to identify various PTLs and their properties, current status and challenges. In an attempt to identify critical parameters for PTL specifications, and facilitate material development, component characterization, and quality control, a functional analysis of PTLs is performed by breaking down main functions, supporting attributes, and associated properties, as well as existing methods and tests to measure each property. As the interface between the CL and the PTL accounts for ohmic, kinetic, and mass transport overpotentials, the importance of the PTL/CL interface is emphasized. Efforts are also made to analyze the effects of PTL properties on performance from various studies conducted by different research groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000771046900001		
J	Di Meo, Sergio; Venditti, Paola								Evolution of the Knowledge of Free Radicals and Other Oxidants								OXIDATIVE MEDICINE AND CELLULAR LONGEVITY				2020						9829176	10.1155/2020/9829176				APR 24 2020	2020	Free radicals are chemical species (atoms, molecules, or ions) containing one or more unpaired electrons in their external orbitals and generally display a remarkable reactivity. The evidence of their existence was obtained only at the beginning of the 20th century. Chemists gradually ascertained the involvement of free radicals in organic reactions and, in the middle of the 20th century, their production in biological systems. For several decades, free radicals were thought to cause exclusively damaging effects . This idea was mainly supported by the finding that oxygen free radicals readily react with all biological macromolecules inducing their oxidative modification and loss of function. Moreover, evidence was obtained that when, in the living organism, free radicals are not neutralized by systems of biochemical defences, many pathological conditions develop. However, after some time, it became clear that the living systems not only had adapted to the coexistence with free radicals but also developed methods to turn these toxic substances to their advantage by using them in critical physiological processes. Therefore, free radicals play a dual role in living systems: they are toxic by-products of aerobic metabolism, causing oxidative damage and tissue dysfunction, and serve as molecular signals activating beneficial stress responses. This discovery also changed the way we consider antioxidants. Their use is usually regarded as helpful to counteract the damaging effects of free radicals but sometimes is harmful as it can block adaptive responses induced by low levels of radicals.									67	0	1	0	33	0	68			1942-0900	1942-0994		WOS:000532251100001	32411336

In this work, a simple and robust method to generate a wide range of osmotically driven surface patterns, including random, lamellar, peanut, and hexagonal structures is developed. This method does not require the use of organic solvents for swelling, pre-patterning of the film surface, or coating of a second layer on the gel. The patterns are fabricated by exposing a photocurable formulation to light while open to air and then swelling, using oxygen inhibition of the radical polymerization at the surface to create a gradient of crosslinking with depth, which was confirmed by measuring the double bond conversion at the surface, surface mechanics, and molecule diffusion into the network. The modulus gradient, and hence osmotic pressure, is controlled by the crosslinker concentration, and the characteristic size of the patterns is determined by the initial film thickness. The patterns are stable in both swollen and dry states, creating a versatile approach that is useful for diverse polymers to create complex patterns with long-range order.									250	10	0	0	23	0	256			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000271132700002

The adsorptive electrode utilized in the electrochemical filter was a porous Graphite-RuO2 electrode decorated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) adsorption layer, which was prepared by sol-gel coating, thermal decomposition, and vacuum filtration synthesis. The morphology and composition of adsorptive electrode characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a uniform distribution of RuO2 active coating and MWCNTs adsorption layer. Electrochemical measurements indicated that the adsorptive electrode possessed a favorable oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of 1.42 V and inner voltammetric charge 170.05 mC.cm(-2), which were higher than that of non-MWCNTs electrode. Furthermore, the mass transfer of adsorptive electrode was enhanced as high as 4.6-fold in the electrochemical filter. The optimal operation parameters obtained was 3 mA.cm(-2) and 7 g.L-1 Na2SO4. Under this condition, the electrochemical filter can remove > 97% of pyrrole and > 75% of total organic carbon. The pyrrole oxidation mechanism of electrochemical filter was also investigated, revealed three dominant reaction stages: adsorption (<= 0.3 V), direct oxidation (0.3-1.2 V) and indirect oxidation (> 1.2 V). In general, the high electrochemical performance of Graphite-RuO2-MWCNTs filter on pyrrole removal resulted from the enhanced mass transfer, which attributed to the synergistic effect of adsorption from MWCNTs, electrochemical oxidation and convection by filtration.									31	2	0	0	12	0	32			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000414083300094

Both the evolution of the interface layer and the initial oxide growth have been investigated in detail. Evaporated Ce overlayers in the range 1-8 angstrom were found to interdiffuse with Al(111) to form a mixed interface with at least three different Ce-Al coordinations. At room temperature, one of the Ce-Al coordinations predominates as the mixed layer grows. At 100 K a wide variation of Ce-Al coordinations is observed, but none of these is preferred during growth. An enhancement in the initial rate of Al(111) substrate oxide growth is observed in the presence of a approximately 2 angstrom Ce overlayer at both temperatures. Decomposition of the Al 2p emission spectrum shows the presence of three suboxide peaks, which are similar to peaks previously observed in the pure oxygen/Al(111) system.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0039-6028			WOS:A1994MW78400015

The objective of the current paper is to give a concise overview about recent researches considering the application of LDH in the textile industry as well as in nanofibers. In this review, firstly, the recent applications of LDHs and their composites as promising adsorbents and/or efficient photocatalyst in the textile dyeing wastewater treatment have been reviewed. Since LDHs have been playing an important role in the design of wearable electronics, the applications of different fibers for creating and developing textile energy storage devices have been presented. In the following, the applications of LDHs for creating textiles with other special features such as UV protection, flame retardancy, and On-demand personal thermal management and also the applications of metal oxide/LDH composite in the textile industry are mentioned. In addition, since nanofibers can be considered as attractive aspects in textile academic circles, new opportunities provided by the synchronous application of LDHs and nanofibers in different areas including medical applications, environmental applications, the catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction, and high-performance supercapacitor electrode have been introduced.

Traditional synthesis methods such as hydrothermal method which is dangerous and high cost limited the scalable developments. Herein, we report a fast, simple, and low-cost synthesis method of nanomaterials based on NF by Joule-heating and water soaking treatment. Thin carbon-coated CoS on NF (NF-C/CoS) was synthesized by Joule-heating for a few seconds with rapid cooling. And then, NF-C/CoS/NiOOH with core-shell heterostructure was fabricated by soaking treatment of NF-C/CoS in water on which NiOOH nanosheets grew spontaneously. The formation mechanism is proposed that the coordination complex precursor converts into C/CoS on NF driven by Joule-heating, and the nickel on the surface of NF is activated to form metastable nickel simultaneously. The metastable nickel reacting with water leads to the formation of NiOOH, and the induction of CoS makes NiOOH grow continuously. This synthesis technology provides a new route to manufacture NF-based nanostructures, and the as-fabricated NF-C/CoS/NiOOH exhibits great potential as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction.									37	5	0	0	0	0	38			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000562862200001	34138175

A fluid inclusion study of quartz veins at the Bidjovagge Au-Cu mine, Ucca-vuovdas, Masi River and Object 43, and of pegmatitic quartz at Daelljadas, has been conducted in order to model fluid evolution along the shear zone at different crustal levels. Fluid inclusions associated with the pegmatitic intrusions in amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks are composed of a low to moderately saline H2O+CO2 solution. Within the upper to middle greenschist facies, fluid inclusions contain immiscible highly saline H2O and CO2. At low greenschist facies, fluid inclusions contain immiscible highly saline H2O and N-2. The highly saline H2O + CO2 fluids were at temperatures between 250 and 400 degrees C and resulted in the albitization, carbonatization and scapolitization of the wall rocks along the shear zones. High temperatures, high salinities, and high fO(2) of the fluid resulted in transport of gold and base metals as chloride complexes. Mineralization, such as at the Bidjovagge Au-Cu mine, formed within the ductile to brittle transition in the shear zone as a result of phase separation and reaction of the mineralizing fluids with graphitic schist. Reduced solubility of metal chloride complexes resulted from the phase separation of CO2 from H2O-rich fluids which increased pH, and from interaction with graphitic schist that drastically reduced the oxygen fugacity of the fluid. Reaction with the graphitic schist also resulted in oxidation of the schist, and addition of CH4 and higher hydrocarbons to the fluid. A metal zonation exists, with copper occurring at each crustal level examined and gold restricted to the brittle-ductile transition. The tendency of gold to be precipitated predominantly in the brittle-ductile transition may reflect the dependence of gold transport on temperature and pressure. Methane in fluid inclusions may serve as a guide to areas where fluid reaction with graphitic schist occurred, such as in the Bidjovagge Au-Cu deposit.									25	4	0	0	1	0	26			0375-6742			WOS:A1993MV89600002

The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5 flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.									4	0	0	0	4	0	4			2041-2851			WOS:000469435200004	30705745

In this communication, a preliminary characterization of the CP43-Glu354Gln mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is presented. The steady-state rate of O-2 evolution in the mutant cells is only approximately 20% compared with the wild-type, but the kinetics of O-2 release are essentially unchanged and the O-2-flash yields show normal period-four oscillations, albeit with lower overall intensity. Purified PSII particles exhibit an essentially normal S-2 state multiline electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal, but exhibit a substantially altered S-2-minus-S-1 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectrum. The intensities of the mutant EPR and FTIR difference spectra (above 75% compared with wild-type) are much greater than the O-2 signals and suggest that CP43-Glu354Gln PSII reaction centres are heterogeneous, with a minority fraction able to evolve O-2 with normal O-2 release kinetics and a majority fraction unable to advance beyond the S-2 or S-3 states. The S-2-minus-S-1 FTIR difference spectrum of CP43-Glu354Gln PSII particles is altered in both the symmetric and asymmetric carboxylate stretching regions, implying either that CP43-Glu354 is exquisitely sensitive to the increased charge that develops on the Mn4Ca cluster during the S-1 -> S-2 transition or that the CP43-Glu354Gln mutation changes the distribution of Mn(III) and Mn(IV) oxidation states within the Mn4Ca cluster in the S-1 and/or S-2 states.									21	0	0	0	16	0	21			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000253117000012	17954433

However, the poor selectivity and activity of H2O2 production hamper traditional industrial applications and emerging photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Herein, we report a C5N2 photocatalyst with a conjugated C=N linkage for selective and efficient non-sacrificial H2O2 production in both normoxic and hypoxic systems. The strengthened delocalization of pi-electrons by linkers in C5N2 downshifted the band position, thermodynamically eliminating side H-2 evolution reaction and kinetically promoting water oxidation. As a result, C5N2 had a competitive solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.55 % in overall H2O2 production and exhibited by far the highest activity under hypoxic conditions (698 mu M h(-1)). C5N2 was further applied to hypoxic PDT/CDT with outstanding performance in apparent cancer cell death and synchronous bioimaging. The study sheds light on the photosynthesis of H2O2 by carbon nitrides for health applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000860075900001	35939064

PS II, a membrane-bound multi-subunit pigment protein complex, couples the one-electron photochemistry at the reaction centre with the four-electron redox chemistry of water oxidation at the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Under illumination, the OEC cycles through five intermediate S-states (S-0 to S-4)(1), in which S-1 is the dark-stable state and S-3 is the last semi-stable state before O-O bond formation and O-2 evolution(2,3). A detailed understanding of the O-O bond formation mechanism remains a challenge, and will require elucidation of both the structures of the OEC in the different S-states and the binding of the two substrate waters to the catalytic site(4-6). Here we report the use of femtosecond pulses from an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) to obtain damage-free, room temperature structures of dark-adapted (S-1), two-flash illuminated (2F; S-3-enriched), and ammonia-bound two-flash illuminated (2F-NH3; S-3-enriched) PS II. Although the recent 1.95 angstrom resolution structure of PS II at cryogenic temperature using an XFEL7 provided a damage-free view of the S-1 state, measurements at room temperature are required to study the structural landscape of proteins under functional conditions(8,9), and also for in situ advancement of the S-states. To investigate the water-binding site(s), ammonia, a water analogue, has been used as a marker, as it binds to the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S-2 and S-3 states(10). Since the ammonia-bound OEC is active, the ammonia-binding Mn site is not a substrate water site(10-13). This approach, together with a comparison of the native dark and 2F states, is used to discriminate between proposed O-O bond formation mechanisms.									249	1	0	0	94	0	251			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000389716800046	27871088	
J	Gong, Xiaohan; Tian, Liyan; Dong, Yanhui								Contrasting melt percolation and melt-rock reactions in the Parece Vela back-arc oceanic lithosphere, Philippine Sea: A mineralogical perspective								LITHOS				422						106727	10.1016/j.lithos.2022.106727				AUG 2022	2022	The accretion and evolution of oceanic lithosphere beneath back-arc spreading ridges remain less understood compared with mid-oceanic ridges (MOR). Here, we investigate mantle peridotites and gabbros recovered from the southernmost side of the Parece Vela back-arc basin, Philippine Sea. The peridotites contain multiple types of clinopyroxenes (Cpx) and amphiboles (Amp) which record contrasting melt percolation and melt-rock reaction processes. Type-1 Cpx shows primary texture and light rare-earth elements (LREE)-depleted pattern, which can be reproduced by ~8-10% fractional melting of depleted MORB mantle. Type-2 Cpx occurs in the deformed peridotites (SY224-1280-2a &-2b) and shows less depleted LREE at similar middle to heavy REE (M-HREE) contents compared with type-1 Cpx. Such features reflect re-equilibration with MORB-type percolating melts, which is further evidenced by elevated TiO2 and Cr# in coexisting spinels and crystallization of associated MORB-type gabbros. Type-3 Cpx occurs in the undeformed peridotites (SY225-1255-1 &-2) and is texturally replaced by type-1 Amp. They show variably enriched large ion lithophile elements (LILE) and LREE at similar M-HREE contents compared with type-1 Cpx, which reflect an open-system (flux) melting and reaction process with a melt flux enriched in LILE and LREE. Type-1 Amp is almost magnesio-hornblende and shows trace-element pattern characteristic of supra-subduction amphiboles, which supports the hydrous melt that formed type-3 Cpx probably originated from subducted slab. In contrast, type-2 Amp occurs in a leucocratic vein in sample SY225-1255-1 and is characterized by nearly flat M-HREE pattern at 600-200 x CI, LREE depletion and marked negative Eu anomaly. These features are consistent with crystallization from an amphibole-saturated melt formed by extreme differentiation of MORB-type melts. Our data, together with previous observations, suggest co-occurrence of hydrous MORB-type and slab-derived melt percolations beneath the Parece Vela spreading ridge, which may affect the chemical evolution of back-arc oceanic lithosphere different from MOR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0024-4937	1872-6143		WOS:000807576600001

We herein demonstrate the clever design and construction of alkali-metal-oxides membrane coated ultrasmall Pt sub-nanoparticle that is deposited on alkali-metal-atoms intercalated carbon nitride for efficient overall water splitting. We verify that the intercalated alkali-metal-atoms (K, Na, Li) would bridge the adjacent layers of carbon nitride for efficient charge interlayer transportation, boosting charge carrier separation; while the formation of mixed alkali-metal-oxides shell on the ultrasmall Pt sub-nanopartile would function as a membrane that is H2 permeable but O2 impermeable. Such a selective permeable membrane is found to block H2/O2 recombination to form H2O. Benefited from these advantages, the as-prepared photocatalyst exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution performance (vacuum condition: AQY = 37%, air condition: AQY = 4.9%) as well as overall water splitting activity in a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1 with suppressed H2/O2 recombination. The innovative design demonstrated here provides new ideas for designing advanced photocatalysts with high charge separation for efficient overall water splitting with no H2/O2 recombination.

This work designed and fabricated the efficient photo-Fenton Schottky catalysts via a facile electrostatic self-assembly of metallic Fe2N nanoparticles scattering on the surface of red g-C3N4 (ultrathin porous oxygen-doped 2D g-C3N4 nanosheets). The porous morphology and exceptional electrical structure of red g-C3N4 endowed more active sites and facilitated the photoexcited charge separation. Benefitting from the Schottky effect and unique dimensional coupling structure, the strong visible light absorption and fast spatial charge transfer were realized in the Schottky junction system. More strikingly, Fe2N as an efficient co-catalyst was in favor of the trap and export of e(-), leading to the Fe3+/Fe2+ transformation and H2O2 activation during the photo-Fenton process. Accordingly, the as-prepared catalysts revealed outstanding activity in photo-Fenton like degradation of tetracycline (TC) although under 5 W white LED light irradiation. Furthermore, the reasonable degradation pathway of TC and corresponding toxicity of the intermediates, as well as the photo-Fenton catalytic mechanism were interpreted and discussed in detail. This study would be a great aid in the development of various Schottky catalysts for heterogeneous photo-Fenton-based environmental remediation systems. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

While the 4H-hexagonal phase is predominant in pure SrMnO3 ceramics, a small amount of 6H-hexagonal polymorph is identified in addition to the primary 4H-hexagonal SrMnO3 and the secondary hexagonal SrAl2O4 phases in the as-sintered ceramics, evidenced by x-ray diffraction and subsequent Rietveld refinement analyses. The existence of the 6H-hexagonal SrMnO3 phase is corroborated using Raman spectroscopy. The chemical compositions and electronic structures of the Al2O3-inserted SrMnO3 compounds are also examined using energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The firstprinciples calculations reveal that there is no clear difference between the total energies of 4H- and 6H-hexagonal polymorphs regardless of the presence/absence of Sr and oxygen vacancies. Possible origins are discussed with the estimation of actual strain based on the refined lattice parameter of 6H SrMnO3.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000651856300001

In this study, a flower-like bismuth oxycarbonate/bismuth oxybromide (Bi2O2CO3/BiOBr, BOC/BiOBr) Z-scheme heterojunction was prepared via generation of BOC followed by in situ self-growth of BiOBr on just generated BOC. The obtained photocatalyst has an interlaced nanosheet structure with oxygen vacancies, which enhances light adsorption and facilitates the migration and separation of charge carriers. The highest apparent rate constants (k) in the degradation of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin using the BOC/BiOBr-2 photocatalyst under visible-light irradiation were 0.0282 and 0.0220 min(-1), respectively; these values were 6.1 and 6.2 times, respectively higher than that achieved using BOC as a photocatalyst. The hybrid mode of BOC and BiOBr, and the Z scheme electron transfer path and oxygen vacancies present in BOC/BiOBr are the factors responsible for its high photocatalytic activity.

The physicochemical properties and electrochemical performance of the coatings were investigated by simultaneous differential scanning calorimetry/thermogravimetric analysis (DSC-TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Results indicate that the degree of IrO2 crystallinity significantly affects the coating properties. XRD pattern of the coating prepared at 350 degrees C has shown no reflection peaks indicating that the IrO2 and Ta2O5 were amorphous. The DSC-TGA showed two major exothermic peaks at 475 and 575 degrees C attributed to the crystallization of IrO2 and oxidation of Ta2O5 from chloride precursor solution, respectively. XPS data reveals the presence of both Ir valance states, which confirms the reversible redox transition of Ir (III)/Ir (IV). The Raman spectra of the coatings demonstrated that the MWCNT gradually loses its tube structure at the calcination temperatures of 450 and 550 degrees C, and they transform into a graphite-like structure by crystallization of IrO2. However, in the coating without IrO2, the modification of the MWCNT structure was not observed at the calcination temperature of 550 degrees C. The performance of calcined anodes for brine electrolysis was studied using a membrane cell, which showed that the output current density reduces with increasing calcination temperature. The results of the EIS analysis at oxygen evolution potential showed that the charge transfer resistance of IrO2-Ta2O5-MWCNT composite increases from 1.1 to 18.2 (Omega.cm(2)) due to gradual IrO2 crystallization, which illustrates a sharp reduction in the electrochemical OER activity.									17	0	0	0	3	0	17			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000488148100045

Here, we propose a method to remove SO2 with highly synergistic H2O2 production based on a novel dual-function photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system in which the jointed spontaneous reaction of desulfurization and H2O2 production was integrated instead of nonspontaneous reaction of O-2 to H2O2. SO2 was absorbed by alkali liquor then oxidized quickly into SO42- by a nanorod alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, which possessed high alkali corrosion resistance and electron transport properties. H2O2 was produced simultaneously in the cathode chamber on a gas diffusion electrode and was remarkably boosted by the conversion reaction of SO32- to SO42- in the anode chamber in which the released chemical energy was effectively used to increase H2O2. The photocurrent density increased by 40% up to 1.2 mA.cm(-2), and the H2O2 evolution rate achieved 58.8 mu mol.L-1.h(-1).cm(-2) with the synergistic treatment of SO2, which is about five times than that without SO2. This proposed PEC cell system offers a cost-effective and environmental-benign approach for dual purpose of flue gas desulfurization and simultaneous high-valued H2O2 production.									15	0	0	0	4	0	15			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000572834700054	32786587

We now report the kinetic profiles of water splitting by a self-assembled nickel-borate (NiBi) OEC. Mechanistic studies of anodized films of NiBi exhibit the low Tafel slope of 2.3 X RT/2F (30 mV/decade at 25 degrees C). This Tafel slope together with an inverse third order rate dependence on H+ activity establishes NiBi as an ideal catalyst to be used in the construction of photoelectrochemical devices for water splitting. In contrast, nonanodized NiBi films display significantly poorer activity relative to their anodized congeners that we attribute to a more sluggish electron transfer from the catalyst resting state. Borate is shown to play two ostensibly antagonistic roles in OEC activity: as a promulgator of catalyst activity by enabling proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and as an inhibitor in its role as an adsorbate of active sites. By defining the nature of the PCET pre-equilibrium that occurs during turnover, trends in catalyst activity may be completely reversed at intermediate pH as compared to those at pH extremes. These results highlight the critical role of PCET pre-equilibria in catalyst self-assembly and turnover, and accordingly suggest a reassessment in how OEC activities of different catalysts are compared and rationalized.									352	10	0	0	45	0	353			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000315936700057	23360238

The genes, rppA (sll0797) and rppB (sll0798), represent a two-component regulatory system that controls the synthesis of photosystem IE (PSII) and PSI genes, in addition to photopigment-related genes. rppA. (regulator of photosynthesis- and photopigment-related gene expression) and rppB exhibit strong sequence similarity to prokaryotic response regulators and histidine kinases, respectively. In the wild type, the steady-state mRNA levels of PSII reaction center genes increased when the plastoquinone (PQ) pool was oxidized and decreased when the PQ pool was reduced, whereas transcription of the PSI reaction center genes was affected in an opposite fashion. Such results suggested that the redox poise of the PQ pool is critical for regulation of the photosystem reaction center genes. In Delta rppA, an insertion mutation of rppA, the PSII gene transcripts were highly up-regulated relative to the wild type under all redox conditions, whereas transcription of phycobilisome-related genes and PSI genes was decreased. The higher transcription of the psbA gene in Delta rppA was manifest by higher translation of the D1 protein and a concomitant increase in O-2 evolution. The results demonstrated that RppA is a regulator of photosynthesis- and photopigment-related gene expression, is involved in the establishment of the appropriate stoichiometry between the photosystems, and can sense changes in the PQ redox poise.									114	2	0	0	113	0	121			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000088216800020	10894737

The oxidized SWNTs exhibited lower absorption and radial breathing mode ( RBM) peaks and a higher intensity ratio of the D band to the G band ( D/G) in their absorption and Raman spectra than those of the pristine SWNTs. After the thermal treatment, the D/G ratio of the oxidized SWNTs almost recovered its original intensity, regardless of the degree of oxidation. The absorption, photoluminescence ( PL), and RBM peaks could not recover their original intensities when the oxidation degree was high. The results indicate that the elimination and decomposition reactions proceeded competitively depending on the degree of oxidation. In addition, a new PL peak was observed in the near-infrared region, and the PL peak intensity increased with the subsequent thermal treatment. The theoretical calculations provided an insight into the possible pathways for the decomposition of oxidized SWNTs, showing that the O-2 elimination and CO/CO2 evolution proceed competitively during thermal treatment.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000384807600026	27624674

In all types of meteorites, diamond is restricted to the metallic taenite-kamacite phase, in which it occurs together with moissanite (SiC), daubreelite, troilite, and spinel. The diamond is specifically high in its abundances of hydrogen, nitrogen, and noble gases, with a uniform ''spectrum'' of species. The diamond of ureilites is magmatic; it was the first phase to crystallize from the nickel-iron fluid-bearing melt, from which graphite and kamacite crystallized later. The latter mineral occurs as drop-shaped inclusions in graphite. The diamondiferous melt of ureilites fills interstitions and veinlets. As a result of the fluid effect of this melt, the olivine iron mole fraction decreases from 17 - 20 to 0, and native iron and enstatite form:Mg1.7Fe0.3SiO4 + 0.3H(2) = 0.7Mg(2)SiO(4) + 0.3MgSiO(3) + 0.3Fe + 0.3H(2)O.The high-pressure conditions of this effect are evident from the occurrence of both diamondiferous mineralization and pyrope, which we first discovered in ureilites. The diamond of chondrites is restricted to the taenite-kamacite melt in the matrix, which actively affects the pyroxene-olivine chondrules. The paper describes the proposed two-stage genetic model for the evolution of parental meteoritic planets: stage I, under high pressure of the hydrogen envelopes and progressively more reduced conditions, and stage II, after the migration of the gas envelopes in a progressively more oxidized environment. The model explains the relict nature of diamondiferous mineralization in chondrites, which originated exclusively during stage I of planetary evolution. The progresively stronger effect of hydrogen on the molten meteoritic material during this stage accounts for the coexistence of diamondiferous mineralization and the isotopic anomalies of the chondrites. The metallic compounds that formed during this stage show anomalously low oxidation states (SiO, SiH2, SiCl2, etc.) due to reactions such as SiO2 + H-2 = SiO + H2O. Such reactions result in that the silicates in assemblage with diamond are anomalously enriched in isotopically light oxygen, for example:2MgO + 2Si0 + CH2 + CO = Mg2SiO4 + SiC + C + H2O.The chondritic assemblage of diamond and moissanite (SiC) and the occurrence of native silicon provide evidence for the operation of such reactions during diamond-forming processes.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			0869-5911			WOS:A1995RW79800001

One of the least understood steps of Chl biosynthesis is formation of the fifth (E) ring, where the red substrate, magnesium protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester, is converted to the green product, 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide a. In oxygenic phototrophs, this reaction is catalyzed by an oxygen-dependent cyclase, consisting of a catalytic subunit (AcsF/CycI) and an auxiliary protein, Ycf54. Deletion of Ycf54 impairs cyclase activity and results in severe Chl deficiency, but its exact role is not clear. Here, we used a.ycf54 mutant of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to generate suppressor mutations that restore normal levels of Chl. Sequencing.ycf54 revertants identified a single D219G amino acid substitution in CycI and frameshifts in slr1916, which encodes a putative esterase. Introduction of these mutations to the original.ycf54 mutant validated the suppressor effect, especially in combination. However, comprehensive analysis of the.ycf54 suppressor strains revealed that the D219G-substituted CycI is only partially active and its accumulation is misregulated, suggesting that Ycf54 controls both the level and activity of CycI. We also show that Slr1916 has Chl dephytylase activity in vitro and its inactivation up-regulates the entire Chl biosynthetic pathway, resulting in improved cyclase activity. Finally, large-scale bioinformatic analysis indicates that our laboratory evolution of Ycf54-independent CycI mimics natural evolution of AcsF in low-light-adapted ecotypes of the oceanic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus, which lack Ycf54, providing insight into the evolutionary history of the cyclase enzyme.									3	0	0	0	3	0	3			0027-8424			WOS:000627429100102	33649240

There is much epidemiological evidence for disease prevention by dietary antioxidants and chemical evidence that such compounds react in one-electron reactions with free radicals in vitro. Nonetheless, kinetic constraints indicate that in vivo scavenging of radicals is ineffective in antioxidant defense. Instead, enzymatic removal of nonradical electrophiles, such as hydroperoxides, in two-electron redox reactions is the major antioxidant mechanism. Furthermore, we propose that a major mechanism of action for nutritional antioxidants is the paradoxical oxidative activation of the Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) signaling pathway, which maintains protective oxidoreductases and their nucleophilic substrates. This maintenance of "nucleophilic tone," by a mechanism that can be called "para-hormesis," provides a means for regulating physiological nontoxic concentrations of the nonradical oxidant electrophiles that boost antioxidant enzymes, and damage removal and repair systems (for proteins, lipids, and DNA), at the optimal levels consistent with good health.

Lowtemperature conversion of chemical to electrical energy is of particular importance to minimize the impact to the environment while sustaining the consumptive economy. In this review, we shed light on one of the most versatile energy-conversion technologies: heterogeneous catalysts. We establish the integrity of structural tailoring in heterogeneous catalysts at different scales in the context of an emerging paradigm in materials science: catalytic nanoarchitectonics. Fundamental backgrounds of energy-conversion catalysis are first provided together with a perspective through state-of-the-art energy-conversion catalysis including catalytic exhaust remediation, fuel-cell electrocatalysis and photosynthesis of solar fuels. Finally, the future evolution of catalytic nanoarchitectonics is overviewed: possible combinations of heterogeneous catalysts, organic molecules and even enzymes to realize reaction-selective, highly efficient and long-life energy conversion technologies which will meet the challenge we face.									205	4	0	0	7	0	205			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000368910800016

Four different regimes are encountered. (1) At the highest accretion rates, models become red giants after the accretion of only a very small amount of mass. As the accretion rate is decreased, models are encountered that (2) burn hydrogen at the same rate at which it is accreted, (3) experience a series of nondynamical hydrogen shell flashes followed eventually by a powerful helium shell flash, and, finally, (4) experience nova-like hydrogen shell flashes.Although all of the regimes have been explored, special attention has been given to models that experience recurrent mild hydrogen-burning pulses or burn hydrogen at a stationary rate. For lower accretion rates, the helium flash is so powerful that the convective layer forced by helium burning penetrates deeply into the hydrogen-rich envelope; this penetration may lead to the ejection of external layers even if the helium flash would not of itself have become dynamical. For higher accretion rates, even when convection does not penetrate into hydrogen-rich layers, the helium layer expands, and much, if not most, of the accreted matter is lost during the event because of the interaction of the expanded envelope with the companion star.Analysis of the results suggests that it is unlikely that, in the real world, a hydrogen-accreting CO white dwarf with a typical initial mass will attain the Chandrasekhar mass. Dynamical helium-burning flashes are probable.									85	3	0	0	0	0	86			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000072782900033

Its effects on plants may depend on the duration of exposure. We focused on two different phases of microgravity responses in space. When higher plants are exposed to short-term (seconds to hours) microgravity, such as on board parabolic flights and sounding rockets, their cells usually exhibit abiotic stress responses. For example, Ca (2+)-, lipid-, and pH-signaling are rapidly enhanced, then the production of reactive oxygen species and other radicals increase dramatically along with changes in metabolism and auxin signaling. Under long-term (days to months) microgravity exposure, plants acclimatize to the stress by changing their metabolism and oxidative response and by enhancing other tropic responses. We conclude by suggesting that a systematic analysis of regulatory networks at the molecular level of higher plants is needed to understand the molecular signals in the distinct phases of the microgravity response and adaptation.									28	1	1	0	19	0	30			0938-0108	1875-0494		WOS:000366103800001

Here, we investigate glutathione (GSH)-dependent redox homeostasis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial respiratory functions in camel tissues and compare them with imported domestic goats and laboratory rats and mice. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) and GSH-metabolizing enzymes were differentially expressed in the liver and kidney of these animals. Camel liver has significantly lower GSH pool than that in goats, rats and mice. Mitochondria isolated from the tissues of these animals showed a comparable ability to metabolize specific substrates for respiratory enzyme complexes I, II/III and IV. These complexes were metabolically more active in the kidney than in the liver of all the species. Furthermore, the activity of complex IV in camel tissues was significantly lower than in other species. On the other hand, complex II/III activity in camel kidney was higher compared to the other species. In addition, as expected, we observed that inhibitors of these enzyme complexes augment the production of mitochondrial ROS in camel and goat tissues. These results help to better understand the metabolic ability and adaptation in desert camels in comparison with domestic goats and laboratory rats and mice since they are exposed to different environmental and dietary conditions. Our study may also have implications in the pharmacology and toxicology of drugs and pollutants in these species.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000283139900001	20532892

Its use, performing numerical simulations on initiation and propagation of planar detonation waves in combustible mixtures H-2-Air and H-2-O-2-Ar, is described. Unsteady one dimensional (1D) Euler equations coupled with sources to take into account chemical activity, are numerically solved using the Kurganov, Noelle and Petrova second order scheme in a domain discretized with finite volumes. The computational code can work with any number of species and its corresponding reactions, but here it was tested with 13 chemically active species (one species inert), and 33 elementary reactions. A gaseous igniter which acts like a shock-tube driver, and powerful enough to generate a strong shock capable of triggering exothermic chemical reactions in fuel mixtures, is used to start planar detonations. The following main aspects of planar detonations are here, treated: induction time of combustible mixtures cited above and required mesh resolutions; convergence of overdriven detonations to Chapman-Jouguet states; detonation structure (ZND model); and the use of reflected shocks to determine induction times experimentally. The rhoCentralRfFoam code was verified comparing numerical results and it was validated, through analytical results and experimental data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It was demonstrated to play a crucial role in stimulating absorption ability and photodegradation performance for the removal of methylene blue present in high concentration. In contrast, direct calcination was almost ineffective, whereas post-calcination was significantly detrimental. Moreover, the photocatalytic water oxidation activity of hydrothermally crystallizated volborthite was comparable to that of BiVO4, and it was clearly higher than those of WO3 and g-C3N4 from aqueous NaIO3 solution. By further in situ decoration with an optimum amount of CoOx cocatalysts (i.e., 2 wt%), the oxygen evolution rate of volborthite was greatly enhanced, and it was 1.6-fold, 1.8-fold and 2.9-fold higher than those of BiVO4, WO3 and g-C3N4, respectively. The importance of hydrothermal crystallization can be elucidated in terms of water-Kagome lattice structure interactions involving built-in intrinsic electric field and formation of single hydrogen bonds.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000449171800008	30027964

Nitrate samples and complementary data were collected at Alert, Nunavut, Canada (82 degrees 30' N, 62 degrees 19' W) in spring 2004. Covering the polar sunrise period, characterized by the occurrence of severe boundary layer ozone depletion events (ODEs), our data show a significant correlation between the variations of atmospheric ozone (O-3) mixing ratios and Delta O-17 of nitrate (Delta O-17( NO3-)). This relationship can be expressed as: Delta O-17(NO3-)/parts per thousand = (0.15 +/- 0.03) x O-3/(nmol mol(-1))+( 29.7 +/- 0.7), with R-2=0.70(n=12), for Delta O-17(NO3-) ranging between 29 and 35 parts per thousand. We derive mass-balance equations from chemical reactions operating in the Arctic boundary layer, that describe the evolution of Delta O-17( NO3-) as a function of the concentrations of reactive species and their isotopic characteristics. Changes in the relative importance of O-3, RO2 and BrO in the oxidation of NO during ODEs, and the large isotope anomalies of O-3 and BrO, are the driving force for the variability in the measured Delta O-17( NO3-). BrONO2 hydrolysis is found to be a dominant source of nitrate in the Arctic boundary layer, in agreement with recent modeling studies.									68	5	0	0	13	0	72			1680-7316			WOS:000245048700002

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)-based materials have attracted a great deal of attention as the potential candidate for effectively catalyzing ORR/OER due to their adjustable composition and porous structure. Herein, we first introduce the Mn species into zeolitic-imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) and then further pyrolyze the Mn-containing bimetallic ZIFs to synthesize core-shell-structured Co@Co4N nanoparticles embedded into MnO-modified porous N-doped carbon nanocubes (Co@Co4N/MnO-NC). Co@Co4N/MnO-NC exhibits the outstanding catalytic activity toward ORR and OER which is attributed to its abundant pyridinic/graphitic N and Co4N, the optimized content of MnO species, highly dispersed catalytic sites and porous carbon matrix. As a result, the Co@Co4N/MnO-NC-based Zn-air battery exhibits enhanced performances, including the high discharge capacity (762 mAh g(Zn)(-1)), large power density (200.5 mW cm(-2)), stable potential profile over 72 h, low overpotential (< 1.0 V) and superior cycling life (2800 cycles). Moreover, the belt-shaped Co@Co4N/MnO-NC cathode-based Zn-air batteries are also designed which exhibit the superb electrochemical properties at different bending/twisting conditions.

J	Kjartansdottir, Cecilia Kristin; Nielsen, Lars Pleth; Moller, Per								Development of durable and efficient electrodes for large-scale alkaline water electrolysis								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				38	20			8221	8231		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.101				JUL 9 2013	2013	A new type of electrodes for alkaline water electrolysis is produced by physical vapour depositing (PVD) of aluminium onto a nickel substrate. The PVD Al/Ni is heat-treated to facilitate alloy formation followed by a selective aluminium alkaline leaching. The obtained porous Ni surface is uniform and characterized by a unique interlayer adhesion, which is critical for industrial application. IR-compensated polarisation curves prepared in a half-cell setup with 1 M KOH electrolyte at room temperature reveals that at least 400 mV less potential is needed to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen with the developed porous PVD Al/Ni electrodes as compared to solid nickel electrodes. High-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR-SEM) micrographs reveal Ni-electrode surfaces characterized by a large surface area with pores down to a few nanometre sizes. Durability tests were carried out in a commercially produced bipolar electrolyser stack. The developed electrodes showed stable behaviour under intermittent operation for over 9000 h indicating no serious deactivation in the density of active sites.

Notably, the defects concentration and type greatly affect the intrinsic properties of ZnO. Thus, controllable adjustment of ZnO defects is particularly important for studying its photoelectric properties. In this work, we fabricated ZnO ceramics (ZnO(C)) with different defects through spark plasma sintering (SPS) process by varying sintering temperature and using reduction environment. The experimental results indicate that the changes of color and light absorption in as-prepared ZnO originate from the different kinds of defects, i.e., oxygen vacancies (V-O), interstitial zinc (Zn-i), and Zinc vacancies (V-Zn). Moreover, with the increase in calcination temperature, the concentration of oxygen defects and interstitial zinc defects in the ceramics increases gradually, and the conductivity of the ceramics is also improved. However, too many defects are harmful to the photoelectrochemical properties of the ceramics, and the appropriate oxygen defects can improve the utilization of visible light.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2079-4991		WOS:000711471400001	34684947

It has confirmed that Ni reduction from Ni4+ to Ni2+ plays the leading role in charge compensation when the lithiation voltage is above 4.5 V. Our study also unveils the participation of oxygen in the charge compensation. Furthermore, the enhanced difference in the electronic structures of the surface and bulk in electrochemically cycled samples, and the different surface electronic structures of the fully discharged LNMO and the pristine one, highlight the importance of electrochemical activation. These findings are critical for a better understanding of the electrochemical reaction of LNMO and the influence of structural modifications to the surface region upon its performance, and will assist further efforts to improve this high-voltage cathode material for its application in lithium ion batteries.									37	2	0	0	2	0	38			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000338116700034	24912501

An anodic oxide layer of this inexpensive alloy has been noted to have interesting photoelectrochemical behaviour similar to that of alpha-Fe2O3 prepared using other expensive starting materials. An ordered nanoporous oxide layer has been grown on to the low-carbon steel surface by a simple electrochemical anodization process in different electrolytes such as ethylene glycol containing 0.05M NH4F and 3-10 vol% water and 0.5M phosphoric acid solution containing 0.05M NH4F. After anodization, the nanoporous anodic oxide layer has been transformed to alpha-Fe2O3 by a low-temperature annealing process. Photoelectrochemical characterization of the anodic iron oxide materials has been carried out in 1M KOH electrolyte under a solar simulated illumination using Air Mass (AM) 1.5. The ordered nanoporous oxide layer prepared in ethylene glycol-based electrolyte showed a photocurrent density of about 85 mu A cm(-2) at 0.4 V-Ag/AgCl. Whereas the anodic iron oxide prepared by anodization of the low-carbon steel in 0.5M H3PO4 + 0.05M NaF solution showed a photocurrent density of 800 mu A cm(-2) at 0.4 V-Ag/AgCl. The improved photoactivity of the phosphate-modified oxide layer could be attributed to the high charge carrier concentration, low charge transfer resistance and better ability to expend holes in the oxygen evolution reaction.									11	1	0	0	1	0	12			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000283296200011

Unfortunately, due to the development of oxidative reactions, some quality indices change during storage leading to a progressive deterioration of EVOO quality. To avoid the risk of product downgrading in the virgin oil category, the development of effective shelf-life prediction models is extremely important for the olive oil industry. In this research, the accelerated shelf-life testing (ASLT) protocol was applied to evaluate the temperature dependence of selected oxidation indexes as well as to develop a shelf-life predictive model. The evolution of conventional (peroxide value, K232, K270, polyphenols, tocopherols and hexanal) and unconventional parameters (conjugated trienes and pyropheophytin a) was monitored in bottled EVOO stored in the dark at increasing temperature (25, 40, 50 and 60 degrees C). Accordingly, for well-packed products with reduced oxygen in headspace, the best shelf-life index allowing the ability to predict EVOO SL turned out to be K270. In addition, pyropheophytin a (%) has been shown to be more sensitive to temperature changes than the secondary oxidation indices, thus suggesting its use as a freshness indicator for storage temperatures higher than 25 degrees C.									19	0	0	0	10	0	19				2304-8158		WOS:000526529800088	32150931

Furthermore, the frequency of occurrence of ECSNe is not known, though it has been estimated to be of the order of a few per cent of all core-collapse supernovae. We attempt to constrain the explosion mechanism (neutron-star-forming implosion or thermonuclear explosion) and the frequency of occurrence of ECSNe using nucleosynthesis simulations of the latter scenario, population synthesis, the solar abundance distribution, pre-solar meteoritic oxide grain isotopic ratio measurements and the white dwarf mass-radius relation. Tracer particles from the 3d hydrodynamic simulations were post-processed with a large nuclear reaction network in order to determine the complete compositional state of the bound ONeFe remnant and the ejecta, and population synthesis simulations were performed in order to estimate the ECSN rate with respect to the CCSN rate. The 3d deflagration simulations drastically overproduce the neutron-rich isotopes Ca-48, Ti-50, Cr-54, Fe-60 and several of the Zn isotopes relative to their solar abundances. Using the solar abundance distribution as our constraint, we place an upper limit on the frequency of thermonuclear ECSNe as 1-3% the frequency at which core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe) occur. This is on par with or 1 dex lower than the estimates for ECSNe from single stars. The upper limit from the yields is also in relatively good agreement with the predictions from our population synthesis simulations. The Cr-54/Cr-52 and Ti-50/Ti-48 isotopic ratios in the ejecta are a near-perfect match with recent measurements of extreme pre-solar meteoritc oxide grains, and Cr-53/Cr-52 can also be matched if the ejecta condenses before mixing with the interstellar medium. The composition of the ejecta of our simulations implies that ECSNe, including accretion-induced collapse of oxygen-neon white dwarfs, could actually be partial thermonuclear explosions and not implosions that form neutron stars. There is still much work to do to improve the hydrodynamic simulations of such phenomena, but it is encouraging that our results are consistent with the predictions from stellar evolution modelling and population synthesis simulations, and can explain several key isotopic ratios in a subset of pre-solar oxide meteoritic grains. Theoretical mass-radius relations for the bound ONeFe WD remnants of these explosions are apparently consistent with several observational WD candidates. The composition of the remnants in our simulations can reproduce several, but not all, of the spectroscopically-determined elemental abundances from one such candidate WD.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			1432-0746			WOS:000457148300001

J	Osano, Yugo; Ono, Kouichi								Atomic-scale cellular model and profile simulation of poly-Si gate etching in high-density chlorine-based plasmas: Effects of passivation layer formation on evolution of feature profiles								JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY B				26	4			1425	1439		10.1116/1.2958240				JUL 2008	2008	Atomic-scale cellular model has been developed to simulate the feature profile evolution during poly-Si gate etching in high-density Cl-2 and Cl-2/O-2 plasmas, with emphasis being placed on the formation of passivation layers on feature surfaces. The model took into account the behavior of Cl+ ions, Cl and O neutrals, and etch products and byproducts of SiClx and SiClxOy in microstructural features. The transport of ions and neutrals in microstructures and in substrates was analyzed by the two-dimensional Monte Carlo calculation with three velocity components. The surface chemistry included ion-enhanced etching, chemical etching, and passivation layer formation through surface oxidation and deposition of etch products and byproducts. The computational domain was taken to consist of two-dimensional square cells or lattices of atomic size, and the evolving interfaces were represented by removing Si atoms from and/or allocating them at the cells concerned. Calculations were performed for different line-and-space pattern features of down to 30 nm space width, with an incoming ion energy, ion flux, and neutral reactant-to-ion flux ratio of E-i=50 eV, Gamma(0)(i)=1.0x10(16) cm(-2) s(-1), and Gamma(0)(n)/Gamma(0)(i)=10. Numerical results reproduced the evolution of feature profiles, critical dimensions, and their microscopic uniformity (or aspect-ratio dependence) on nanometer scale, depending on substrate temperature, incoming flux of oxygen and etch byproducts, and sticking probability of etch products and byproducts on feature surfaces: the lateral etching on sidewalls is suppressed by surface oxidation thereon. The oxidation also reduces the etch rate on bottom surfaces, leading to a transition from regular to inverse reactive ion etching (RIE) lag with increasing flux of oxygen; in practice, the RIE lag remains almost unchanged for narrow space features owing to reduced oxygen fluxes thereinto, thus leading to regular and inverse RIE lags coexistent in a series of different pattern features. The deposition or redeposition of etch products (desorbed from feature surfaces) onto sidewalls results in the sidewall tapering, which is more significant for narrower space features; in contrast, the deposition of byproducts (coming from the plasma) onto sidewalls results in the tapering, which is more significant for wider features. Synergistic effects between the deposition of etch products/byproducts and surface oxidation enhance the passivation layer formation on feature surfaces, which in turn increases the sidewall tapering and the degree of regular and inverse RIE lags depending on feature width. The present model also enabled the authors to simulate the surface reaction multilayers and passivation layers on atomic scale, along with their chemical constituents and surface roughness.

In order to study the discharge characteristics of hydrogen and oxygen mixed gas, Bolsig + solver was used to calculate the energy loss fraction of different electron collisions with the reduced field strength. ZDplaskin package was used to simulate the hydrogen and oxygen mixed gas discharge process. Variation of active particles concentration with time under different discharge conditions was obtained. The results show that the proportion of the energy consumed in the collisions of different types of electrons in the hydrogen-oxygen mixed gas is different. When the reduced field is low, most of the electron energy is consumed by the collision and motivation of molecules, and when the reduced field strength is high, the electron energy is mainly used for the dissociation and ionization of molecules. When the reduced field strength is more than 100Td, the electron concentration in the discharge process rapidly increases, which is more conducive to the generation and accumulation of active particles.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1001-1609			INSPEC:21108846

Here, this challenge is addressed by overlaying arbitrary surfaces with a thermally evaporated metal layer to enable the well-aligned growth of ultralong quasi-2D MOF nanoarrays comprising cobalt ions and thiophenedicarboxylate acids. This interfacial engineering approach allows preferred chelation of carboxyl groups in the ligands with the metal interlayers, thereby making possible the fabrication and patterning of MOF nanoarrays on substrates of any materials or morphologies. The MOF nanoarrays grown on porous metal scaffolds demonstrate high electrocatalytic capability for water oxidation, exhibiting a small overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), or 317 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) as well as negligible decay of performance within 30 h. The enhanced performance stems from the improved electron and ion transport in the hierarchical porous nanoarrays consisting of in situ formed oxyhydroxide nanosheets in the electrochemical processes. This approach for mediating the growth of MOF nanoarrays can serve as a promising platform for diverse applications.									30	4	0	0	2	0	31			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000498282700001	31762172

This is particularly true for exfoliated black phosphorus, which suffers from easy decomposition by air and moisture, hampering its highly desirable applications, especially in electronics. The present work suggests an innovative approach to the functionalization process of this 2D-material based on the selective introduction of chalcogen atoms on the material surface through a reaction with suitable molecular precursors such as stibine chalcogenides (R3Sb(X), X = O or S; R = organyl group). These molecules may readily act as chalcogen-transfer agents and, upon releasing the chalcogen atom atop the bP surface, leave stable stibines (R3Sb) as byproducts, which may be easily removed from the functionalized bP surface. The work provides an overview of all the possible structural, electronic and energy aspects associated with the chalcogen-atom transfer from the stibine to phosphorus based compounds, exemplified by trialkyl phosphines and single layer exfoliated black phosphorus, i.e. phosphorene, P-n. In both cases the oxygen transfer is more exergonic than the sulfur transfer, with the associated free energy barrier for the phosphine process being higher. Although the sulfur transfer for the P-n is found to be endergonic (ca. +3.6 kcal mol(-1)), the process may surely occur at high temperature. The evolution of the band structure upon the chalcogen transfer has been depicted in detail.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000589506700035	33107525

Two sets of ASBRs were subjected to double organic load that influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations were increased from 4,000 +/- 100 to 8,000 +/- 150 mg L-1 for a week. Bioaugmented reactor received the enriched butyric acid-utilizing syntrophic culture (10% w/w) and evolutions of microbial community were analyzed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Aftershock load, the performance of acidification was attained with the effluent COD concentrations increased from 70 to 5,300 mg L-1 and pH decreasing from 7.1 to 5.1 approximately in two reactors. Smithella was badly inhibited by the VFAs accumulation and high H-2 partial pressure. Bioaugmented reactor achieved significantly less time to recover than the non-bioaugmented reactor, 40 and 110 d respectively. The rapid recovery for the bioaugmented reactor was mainly attributed to the added microorganisms containing a large number of Methanobacteriales and Syntrophomonas, released the feed-back inhibition and resulted in a rapid recovery of Smithella, thus accelerated the degradation of propionic acid. Therefore, bioaugmentation is a promising approach for promoting the recovery of the acidified anaerobic reactors caused by the organic shock load.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-3994	1944-3986		WOS:000545021200005

Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons, resulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio (Ye) in the regions processed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne mantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools. This is unstable to efficient mixing. We use the results of MESA models with different size C/O cores to quantify the rate at which the cores mix with the mantle as they cool. In all cases, we find that the WDs undergo significant core/mantle mixing on timescales shorter than the time available to grow the WD to the Chandrasekhar mass (M-Ch) by accretion. As a result, hybrid WDs that reach M-Ch due to later accretion will have lower central carbon fractions than assumed thus far. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for the possibility of SNe Ia from hybrid WDs.									19	2	0	0	0	0	19			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000393890200001

The nanocomposite was characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results demonstrated that the Mn3O4 nanoparticles had been successfully hybridized with the mesoporous WO3 and the WO3/Mn3O4 hybrid was well dispersed on the surface of N-doped graphene with superior interactions. The nanocomposite exhibits higher photocatalytic activity for water oxidation than the individual mesoporous WO3 and WO3/Mn3O4 catalysts. The amount of oxygen evolution from the optimized heterostructural photocatalyst (1.5 wt% Mn3O4 and 2 wt% N-doped graphene) was 294 mu mol g(-1), which was about 3.6 times as high as that from m-WO3. The heterostructure formed between Mn3O4 and m-WO3 enhances photogenerated electron/hole transfer and restrains the recombination of charges greatly. N-doped graphene in the nanocomposite acting as an excellent electron acceptor and mediator also contributes to the increase in photocatalytic performance by promoting the separation and transfer of photogenerated charges. This study suggests a promising method to enhance photocatalytic activity by combining the heterostructural WO3/Mn3O4 hybrid with graphene in a ternary system.									24	1	0	0	3	0	24			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000355487900036

J., Madhu/0000-0003-1424-6952			Influence of TiO2 on the electrochemical performance of pasted type beta-nickel hydroxide electrode in alkaline electrolyte								JOURNAL OF ENERGY CHEMISTRY				25	1			41	48		10.1016/j.jechem.2015.11.006				JAN 2016	2016	Nickel hydroxide was used as the positive electrode material in rechargeable alkaline batteries, which plays a significant role in the field of electric energy storage devices. beta-nickel hydroxide (beta-Ni(OH)(2)) was prepared from nickel sulphate solution using potassium hydroxide as a precipitating agent. Pure beta-phase of nickel hydroxide was confirmed from XRD and FT-IR studies. The effects of TiO2 additive on the beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode performance are examined. The structure and property of the TiO2 added beta-Ni(OH)(2) were characterized by XRD, TG-DTA and SEM analysis. A pasted-type electrode is prepared using nickel hydroxide powder as the main active material on a nickel sheet as a current collector. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies were performed to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the beta-Ni(OH)(2) and TiO2 added beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrodes in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Anodic (E-pa) and cathodic (E-pc) peak potentials are found to decrease after the addition of TiO2 into beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode material. Further, addition of TiO2 is found to enhance the reversibility of the electrode reaction and also increase the separation of the oxidation current peak of the active material from the oxygen evolution current. Compared with pure beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode, TiO2 added beta-Ni(OH)2 electrode is found to exhibit higher proton diffusion coefficient (D) and lower charge transfer resistance. These findings suggest that the TiO2 added beta-Ni(OH)(2) electrode possess improved electrochemical properties and thus can be recognized as a promising candidate for the battery electrode applications.

Herein, mesoporous melamine (MMA) comprising nanorods was prepared via facile acid processing on commercial MA (CMA), with similar to 40 times increased specific surface area. By jointly using MMA and the gas template (NH4Br) as the precursor for the first time, hierarchically mesoporous CN (HMCN) was simply synthesized with much thinner nanosheets, similar to 4 times higher specific surface area, stronger photo-absorption, and faster charge separation than bulky CN. On this account, HMCN exhibits much higher photoactivity in H-2 production and for environmental purification. Its visible-light photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate, 1412 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) is similar to 8.9 times that of bulky CN, and reactive oxygen species generation rates are prominently higher than those of CN. The chemical stability of HMCN in the photoreactions is satisfactory. This work provides a simple way to prepare MMA and a novel strategy to synthesize HMCN, which may guide synthesis of other mesoporous CN-based photocatalysts.									19	1	0	0	5	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000494815600113

Herein, heterojunction MFe2O4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Mn) nanofiber (NF) based films with three-dimensional configurations were synthesized by electrospinning and the subsequent thermal treatment processes. Characterization results indeed show the 3D net-like textural structures of the electrospun spinel-type MFe2O4 NFs. In particular, the resulting MFe2O4 NFs have lengths up to several dozens of micrometers with an average diameter size of about 150 nm and possess abundant micro/meso/macropores on both the surface and within the films. The hierarchically porous structures and high surface areas of these MFe2O4 NFs (for example, the CoFe2O4 NFs possess a larger BET specific surface area (61.48 m(2) g(-1)) than those of the CoFe2O4 NPs (5.93 m(2) g(-1))) can afford accessible transport channels for effectively decreasing the mass transport resistances, enhancing the electrical conductivity, and increasing the density and reactivity of the exposed catalytic active sites. All these advantages will be responsible for the better electrocatalytic performances of these MFe2O4 NFs compared with their structural isomers (i.e. the MFe2O4 NPs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and H2O2 reduction in alkaline solution. Meanwhile, both the OER and H2O2 reduction catalytic activities for these MFe2O4 NFs obey the order of CoFe2O4 NFs > CuFe2O4 NFs > NiFe2O4 NFs > MnFe2O4 NFs > Fe2O3 NFs. The CoFe2O4 NFs represent a new class of highly efficient non-noble-metal catalysts for both OER and H2O2 reduction/detection in alkaline media.									341	11	0	0	25	0	345			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000354204400031	25917286

The phosphate removal rate increased with the increase of DO and Fe(II)(0) but firstly increased and then decreased with pH. The reaction kinetics of phosphate removal as a function of DO, Fe(II)(0) and pH all followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. For the tested DO conditions, quantitative relationship between k(P) and k(Fe) was described by the equation: k(p) = 0.6024 k(Fe)+0.0004. For the tested Fe(II)(0) conditions, the evolution of k(P) versus k(Fe) was expressed by two equations: k(p) =1.9573 k(Fe) - 0.0233 (Fe(II)(0) from 10 to 30 mg/L) and k(p) =13.252 k(Fe) - 0.2215 (Fe(II)(0) from 30 to 45 mg/L). For the tested pH conditions, relationship between k(p) and k(Fe) followed two equations: k(p)= 0.5911 k(Fe) - 0.0001 (pH from 6.0 to 8.0) and k(p) = 0.2274 k(Fe) + 0.4401 (pH from 8.0 to 9.0). The precipitates formed at higher DO tended to be more compact, and featured by relatively bigger size, thus it resulted in better solid-liquid separation.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1018-4619	1610-2304		WOS:000333071900005		
J	OLIVE, KA; STEIGMAN, G					Olive, Keith/0000-0001-7201-5998			ON THE ABUNDANCE OF PRIMORDIAL HELIUM								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES				97	1			49	58		10.1086/192134				MAR 1995	1995	We have used recent observations of helium-4, nitrogen, and oxygen from some four dozen, low-metallicity, extragalactic H II regions to define mean N vs. O, He-4 vs. N, and He-4 vs. O relations which are extrapolated to zero metallicity to determine the primordial He-4 mass fraction Y-P. The data and various subsets of the data, selected on the basis of nitrogen and oxygen, are all consistent with Y-P = 0.232 +/- 0.003. For the 2 sigma (statistical) upper bound we find Y(P)2(sigma) less than or equal to 0.238. Estimating a 2% systematic uncertainty (sigma(syst) = +/- 0.005) leads to a maximum upper bound to the primordial helium mass fraction: Y-P(MAX) = YP2sigma + sigma(syst) less than or equal to 0.243. We compare these upper bounds to Y-P With recent calculations of the predicted yield from big bang nucleosynthesis to derive upper bounds to the nucleon-to-photon ratio eta(eta(10) = 10(10)eta) and the number of equivalent light (less than or similar to 10 MeV) neutrino species. For Y-P less than or equal to 0.238 (0.243), we find eta(10) less than or equal to 2.5(3.9) and N-nu less than or equal to 2.7(3.1). If indeed Y-P less than or equal to 0.238, then BBN predicts enhanced production of deuterium and helium-3 which may be in condlict with the primordial abundances inferred from model-dependent (chemical evolution) extrapolations of solar system and interstellar observations. Better chemical evolution models and more data-especially D-absorption in the QSO Ly-alpha clouds-will be crucial to resolve this potential crisis for BBN. The larger upper bound, Y-P less than or equal to 0.243, is completely consistent with BBN which, now, bounds the universal density of nucleons (for Hubble parameter 40 less than or equal to H-0 less than or equal to 100 km s(-1) Mpc(-1) and cosmic background radiation temperature T = 2.726 +/- 0.010) to lie in the range 0.01 less than or equal to Omega(BBN) less than or equal to 0.09 (for H-0 = 50 h(50) km s(-1) Mpc(-1), 0.04 less than or equal to Omega(BBN) h(50)(2) less than or equal to 0.06).									192	0	0	0	0	1	193			0067-0049			WOS:A1995QJ43600002

We examine the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of this element, combining these data with previous samples of turnoff stars over the full range of halo metallicities. We find that A(Li) increases from a level of similar to2.10 at [Fe/H] = -3.5 to similar to2.40 at [Fe/H] = 1.0, where A(Li) = log(10) (n(Li)/n(H)) + 1200. We compare the observations with several GCE calculations, including existing one-zone models and a new model developed in the framework of inhomogeneous evolution of the Galactic halo. We show that Li evolved at a constant rate relative to iron throughout the halo and old disk epochs but that during the formation of young disk stars, the production of Li relative to iron increased significantly. These observations can be understood in the context of models in which postprimordial Li evolution during the halo and old disk epochs is dominated by Galactic cosmic-ray fusion and spallation reactions, with some contribution from the nu -process in supernovae. The onset of more efficient Li production (relative to iron) in the young disk coincides with the appearance of Li from novae and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The major challenge facing the models is to reconcile the mild evolution of Li during the halo and old disk phases with the more efficient production (relative to iron) at [Fe/H] > -0.5. We speculate that cool-bottom processing (production) of Li in low-mass stars may provide an important late-appearing source of Li, without attendant Fe production, that might explain the Li production in the young disk.									69	1	0	0	0	0	70			0004-637X			WOS:000167594200005		
J	De Geronimo, Francisco C.; Miller Bertolami, Marcelo M.; Plaza, Francisco; Catelan, Marcio								The composition of massive white dwarfs and their dependence on C-burning modeling								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				659						A150	10.1051/0004-6361/202142341				MAR 21 2022	2022	Context. Recent computations of the interior composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs (WDs) have suggested that some WDs could be composed of neon (Ne)-dominated cores. This result is at variance with our previous understanding of the chemical structure of massive WDs, where oxygen is the predominant element. In addition, it is not clear whether some hybrid carbon (C) oxygen (O)-Ne WDs might form when convective boundary mixing is accounted for during the propagation of the C-flame in the C-burning stage. Both the Ne-dominated and hybrid CO-Ne core would have measurable consequences for asteroseismological studies based on evolutionary models. Aims. In this work, we explore in detail to which extent differences in the adopted micro- and macro-physics can explain the different final WD compositions that have been found by different authors. Additionally, we explore the impact of such differences on the cooling times, crystallization, and pulsational properties of pulsating WDs. Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the evolution of intermediate massive stars from the zero age main sequence to the WD stage varying the adopted physics in the modeling. In particular, we explored the impact of the intensity of convective boundary mixing during the C-flash, extreme mass-loss rates, and the size of the adopted nuclear networks on the final composition, age, as well crystallization and pulsational properties of WDs. Results. In agreement with previous authors, we find that the inclusion of convective boundary mixing quenches the carbon flame leading to the formation of hybrid CO-Ne cores. Based on the insight coming from 3D hydro-dynamical simulations, we expect that the very slow propagation of the carbon flame will be altered by turbulent entrainment affecting the inward propagation of the flame. Also, we find that Ne-dominated chemical profiles of massive WDs recently reported appear in their modeling due to a key nuclear reaction being overlooked. We find that the inaccuracies in the chemical composition of the ultra-massive WDs recently reported lead to differences of 10% in the cooling times and degree of crystallization and about 8% in the period spacing of the models once they reach the ZZ Ceti instability strip.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000783030100002

The S-state population distribution obtained by the application of n flashes (n = 0 ... 6) was determined by analysis of EPR spectra; Mn K-edge X-ray absorption spectra were collected. Taking into consideration the likely statistical error in the data and the variability stemming from the use of three different approaches for the determination of edge positions, we obtained an upshift of the edge position by 0.8-1.5, 0.5-0.9, and 0.6-1.3 eV for the S-0-S-1, S-1-S-2, and S-2-S-3 transitions, respectively, and a downshift by 2.3-3.1 eV for the S-3-S-0 transition. These results are highly suggestive of Mn oxidation state changes for all four S-state transitions. In the So-state spectrum, a clearly resolved shoulder in the X-ray spectrum around 6555 eV points toward the presence of Mn(II). We propose that photosynthetic oxygen evolution involves cycling of the photosystem II manganese complex through four distinct oxidation states of this tetranuclear complex: Mn(II)-Mn(III) -Mn(IV)(2) in the So-state, Mn(III)(2)-Mn(IV)(2) in the S-1-state, Mn(III)(1)-Mn(IV)(3) in the S-2-state, and Mn(IV)(4) in the S-3-state.									171	2	0	0	79	0	171			0006-2960			WOS:000077555800002	9860823

When NbTiZrAlV RCCAs were exposed at 500 degrees C, the oxidation behavior was controlled by internal oxygen (O) diffusion, and single oxide layer predominating by Ti2ZrO6 and Nb(2)Zr6O(17) were produced after oxidation for 200 h. The mass gains of alloys with 3 and 11 at% V were 0.042 and 0.018 mg/mm(2), and corresponding average thickness of oxide layer was 70 and 30 mu m. As oxidation temperature was increased to 800 degrees C, volatilization of V2O5 brought out the aggravation of oxidation degree for NbTiZrAlV RCCA, and complex oxide layers consisting of Nb9VO25, Nb(2)Zr6O(17) and TiO2 were obtained after thermal exposure for 24 h. The mass gains of alloys with the V content of 3 and 11 at% were 1.135 and 0.514 mg/mm(2), and the average thickness of oxide layer was 500 and 300 mu m, respectively. In both cases, the antioxidant performance of NbTiZrAlV RCCA was significantly improved by the increased content of V. And the enhanced oxidation resistance could be ascribed to the fact that the increase of V addition enhanced the atom diffusion resistance via minimizing mixing enthalpy and maximizing configurational entropy.

Higher mortality in the asexual form due to a higher parasite load will provide an advantage to the sexual form. In Lake Suwa, Japan, the parasite load (Metagonnimus sp.; Trematoda) of triploid gynogenetic females of Carassius auratus was significantly higher than that of diploid sexual females. In an immunoassay using healthy wild fish that were conditioned for 1 month in laboratory tanks, the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) immune reaction of sexual females was significantly higher than that of gynogenetic females. The NET activity indicates the abundance of oxygen radicals from phagocytes, and hence the level of immune activity of the phagocytes. We suggest that the higher parasite load of the gynogenetic form is in part due to the lower immune activity of the phagocytes (nonspecific immune reaction) in the gynogenetic form compared to the sexual form.

INTELEC - EIGHTEENTH INTERNATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENERGY CONFERENCE								358	366						1996	1996	After more than 18 months on float, production AGM cells continued to emit gas (ie: lose water) at rates too high to permit a 20 year life. The rates did not appear to be declining with time. Gel cells on the same test, but at a lower float voltage, had lower gas emission rates. Catalysts placed in the gas space of AGM cells reduced gas evolution very significantly, mainly by keeping the negative plates from discharging.In a second experiment the effects of voltage and temperature were studied in more detail, both with and without catalysts. The results indicate that AGM cells hi their present form are ill suited to high temperature applications The effects of catalysts in AGM cells gave very encouraging results: a reduction in float current, an increase in negative polarization, a lowering of positive polarization, a reduction in gas emissions by a factor of 2 or more, and the ability to neat safely al lower voltages with consequent beneficial effect on positive grid corrosion and growth.Our results point to the conclusion that a central VRLA cells in general, and our AGM test cells in particular, is that their negative plates tend to discharge, even on steady-state float, due to the oxygen cycle itself.					18th Telecommunications Energy Conference (INTELEC 96)18th Telecommunications Energy Conference (INTELEC 96)	OCT 06-10, 1996OCT 06-10, 1996	IEEE Power Electr SocIEEE Power Electr Soc	BOSTON, MABOSTON, MA	3	0	0	0	0	0	3					0-7803-3508-2	WOS:A1996BH05U00055

The Ca2+-dependent oxygen evolution was competitively inhibited by K+, Rb+, and Cs+, the ionic radii of which are larger than the radius of Ca2+ but not inhibited significantly by Li+ and Na+, the ionic radii of which are smaller than that of Ca2+. Ca2+-depleted membranes without metal cation supplementation showed normal S-2 multiline electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal and an S(2)Q(A)(-) thermoluminescence (TL) band with a normal peak temperature after illumination under conditions for single turnover of PSII. Membranes supplemented with Li+ or Na+ showed properties similar to those of the Ca2+-depleted membranes, except for a small difference in the TL peak temperatures. The peak temperature of the TL band of membranes supplemented with K+, Rb+, or Cs+ was elevated to similar to 38 degreesC which coincided with that of Y(D)(+)Q(A)(-) TL band, and no S-2 EPR signals were detected. The K-induced high-temperature TL band and the S(2)Q(A)(-) TL band were interconvertible by the addition of K+ or Ca2+ in the dark. Both the Ca2+-depleted and the K+-substituted membranes showed the narrow EPR signal corresponding to the S2YZ+ state at g=2 by illuminating the membranes under multiple turnover conditions. These results indicate that the ionic radii of the cations occupying Ca2+-binding site crucially affect the properties of the manganese cluster.									32	1	0	0	19	1	33			0006-3495			WOS:000171205100001	11566758

Particularly, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been extensively studied in the search for sustainable ways of converting solar energy into chemical energy to produce energy-dense fuel with minimal carbon footprint. Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has attracted a lot attention in recent years due to its visible-light activity, favorable conduction and valence band edge positions, and low-cost facile synthesis route. However, BiVO4 still suffers from low carrier separation efficiency and slow oxygen evolution kinetics on its surface. To overcome these weaknesses, various modification strategies, including nanostructural morphology control, element doping, heterostructures (particularly Z-scheme), plasmonic enhancement and surface passivation, have been proposed and implemented to improve its PEC activity. This short review summarizes the most recent advances on the designs of BiVO4-based photocatalysts and photoanodes. Some of the best-performing BiVO4-based photo-electrode structures to date are demonstrated, and the critical parameters that contribute to these outstanding performances are discussed.									30	2	0	0	4	0	32			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000475744800004

However, the key factors controlling such Z-scheme in the binary heterostructures are still unclear. In this paper, we showed that oxygen vacancies could act as an interface electron transfer mediator to promote the direct Z-scheme charge transfer process in binary semiconductor heterostructures of CdS/ZnS. Increasing the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies of ZnO crystal can greatly enhance photocatalytic hydrogen generation of CdS/ZnO heterostructure. This was attributed to the strengthened direct Z-scheme charge transfer process in CdS/ZnO, as evidenced by steady-state/time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and selective photodeposition of metal particles on the heterostructure.

The cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya sp. strain JSC-1, exhibits an extensive photoacclimative response to growth in far-red light that includes the synthesis of chlorophylls d and f. During far-red acclimation, transcript levels increase more than twofold for similar to 900 genes and decrease by more than half for similar to 2000 genes. Core subunits of photosystem I, photosystem II, and phycobilisomes are replaced by proteins encoded in a 21-gene cluster that includes a knotless red/far-red phytochrome and two response regulators. This acclimative response enhances light harvesting for wavelengths complementary to the growth light (lambda = 700 to 750 nanometers) and enhances oxygen evolution in far-red light.									228	5	1	0	197	0	234			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000341483800056	25214622

The development of high-performance cathodes for SIBs will be a favorable choice for competing with the market-dominant lithium-ion batteries. Among the various cathodes, Na3V2(PO4)(2)O2-2xF1+2x (0 <= x <= 1) materials have become a preferred choice due to their superior structural stability, fast ion transport and high operating potential. Herein, a series of materials with various ratios of F- and O2- (F/O) are prepared via a high temperature solid-state method, and the tuning mechanism of different F/O ratios is studied in detail by analyzing the structural evolution, electrochemical performance and reaction kinetics of materials. The optimal F/O ratio material Na3V2(PO4)(2)O0.6F2.4 (x = 0.7) exhibits a favorable rate and cycling performance. The capacity at 20C is equivalent to that of the x = 0 material at 5C, and each cycle decay is 0.040% after 200 cycles at 0.5C. Moreover, the optimized F/O ratio material (x = 0.7) also demonstrates excellent reaction kinetics, and the Na apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app,D-Na) for the high potential region is about 10(-10)-10(-12) cm(2) s(-1). A systematic research of dual anion substitution in phosphates will be useful for the structural design and performance improvement of other cathode materials in SIBs.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1				2052-1537		WOS:000659476700001

The reaction path and phase evolution during the synthesis process are investigated using DSC and X-ray diffraction. High purity and well crystalline Yb3Al5O12 are obtained after calcining the mixed powders at 1150 degrees C for 2 h in air. The average particle size of the Yb3Al5O12 powders is similar to 600 nm. The crystallite size determined from FWHM of XRD reflections is similar to 53 nm. The lattice constant of Yb3Al5O12 determined by Rietveld method is a = 11.930 angstrom. And the atomic positions of Yb3Al5O12 are identified as Yb (0.125, 0, 0.25), Al(1) (0, 0, 0), Al(2) (0.375, 0, 0.25), O (0.2799, 0.1008, 0.1990). The sintering behavior of synthesized Yb3Al5O12 in air and argon atmospheres is studied by means of dilatometer. It is shown that the Yb3Al5O12 powders sintered in argon have a faster densification rate and a higher density than that sintered in air. Furthermore, bulk sample with a density of similar to 97% of the theoretical is obtained after sintering in argon for 4 h at 1600 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Atmospheric Corrosion								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				167	2					021510	10.1149/1945-7111/ab6c61				JAN 30 2020	2020	A novel respirometric approach to monitor atmospheric corrosion kinetics is presented. Simultaneous real-time monitoring of the H-2 evolution reaction (HER) and the O-2 reduction reaction (ORR) is possible with a combination of optical O2 sensor measurements with gravimetric volume sensitive techniques or pressure sensor based techniques in closed chambers. The respirometric method is a universal, non-destructive tool applicable to any metal or alloy. It shows a high sensitivity for low corrosion rates and has a high time-resolution. Different examples of relevant engineering metals and alloys will be provided. Mass loss validation measurements carried out at the end of exposure show a good correlation with the total recorded cathodic charge. For metals with different oxidation states the average valency in the corrosion products can be calculated from the cathodic charge together with mass loss. The versatility of the novel monitoring technique is further demonstrated by studying the influence of wet-dry cycling, temperature steps or changes in the gas composition in situ. The rate of HER, ORR and total corrosion rate during these changing exposure conditions can be tracked directly on the same sample. Overall the new method contributes to bridging the gap between lab tests, accelerated testing and field exposure. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Charge transport and recombination processes were detected through transient photocurrent responses. The visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen production rate and the apparent reaction rate constant of RhB photodegradation with 3%-Ag/TiO2-x catalyst are about 5.3 and 14.0 fold higher than those with the pristine macro-/meso-porous TiO2 framework, respectively. A mechanism based on the synergistic effects of Ag plasmonics and Ti3+-doping at the Ag/TiO2-x heterojunction is proposed, which consistently explains the high photocatalytic performance in hydrogen evolution and the improved photocatalytic decomposition of RhB under visible light. This study demonstrates the effective route to synthesize new heterojunction photocatalytic materials with multifunctional properties using low-cost and rapid microwave processes.									36	3	0	0	5	0	34			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000528481900085

Chronocoulometry and chronoamperometry were performed on the modified electrodes in both phosphate buffer and buffer containing low concentrations of the inorganic complex Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) (bpy = 2,2' bipyridine), which catalyzes guanine oxidation, The charge and current evolution with and without the catalyst were compared to the charge and current evolution for electrodes that were treated with identical oligonucleotides that were substituted at every guanine with the electrochemically inert nucleobase hypoxanthine. Chronocoulometry over 2.5 s shows that roughly 2 electrons per guanine were transferred to the electrode in both the presence and absence of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+), although at a slower rate for the uncatalyzed process. Chronoamperograms measured over 250 ms can be fit to a double exponential decay, with the intensity of the fast component roughly 6-20 times greater than that of the slow component. First- and second-order rate constants for catalytic and direct guanine oxidation were determined from the fast component. The maximum catalytic enhancement for immobilized guanine was found to be i(cat)/i(d) = 4 at 25 muM Ru(bpy)32+, The second-order rate constant for the catalyzed reaction was 1.3 x 10(7) M-1 s(-1), with an apparent dissociation constant of 8.8 muM. When compared to parallel studies in solution, a smaller value of the dissociation constant and a larger value of the second-order rate constant are observed, probably due to distortion of the immobilized DNA, an increase in the local negative charge due to the oxygen sites on the ITO surface, and redox cycling of the catalyst, which maintains the surface concentration of the active form.									104	4	0	0	26	0	104			0003-2700			WOS:000166780200031	11217762

Then, at a temperature of 500 degrees C, the second layer was formed on the first layer from a mixture of amorphous particles of metallic platinum and rutile-structured iridium dioxide nanocrystals having an average crystal grain size of 26 nm.Rutile phase nanocrystals are characterized by a high density of chaotically distributed dislocations and high internal microstrain values. The coatings exhibit a compact granular morphology without cracks on the surface. Their catalytic activity is similar to that of conventional DSAs for the anodic oxidation of chloride ions from both concentrated and dilute sodium chloride solutions. The anodic current efficiency both during chlorate formation and active chlorine production was several percentage points higher in electrolyzers containing these anodes than in those containing DSAs. The catalytic activity of anodes having these coatings is about 50 mV lower than that of DSAs and about 350 mV higher than that of lead/antimony alloy electrodes, for oxygen evolution from acid sulfate solutions (0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4) characteristic of processes for the production of some metals. An accelerated corrosion test showed that the stability of the double-layer anodes is about twelve-fold higher than that of conventional DSAs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

We report here an alkali-heating synthesis to achieve phase-mixed cobalt diselenide material with nearly homogeneous distribution of cubic and orthorhombic phases. Using water electroreduction as a model reaction, we observe that the phase-mixed cobalt diselenide reaches the current density of 10 milliamperes per square centimeter at overpotential of mere 124 millivolts in acidic electrolyte. The catalyst shows no sign of deactivation after more than 400 h of continuous operation and the polarization curve is well retained after 50,000 potential cycles. Experimental and computational investigations uncover a boosted covalency between Co and Se atoms resulting from the phase mixture, which substantially enhances the lattice robustness and thereby the material stability. The findings provide promising design strategy for long-lived catalysts in acid through crystal phase engineering.									47	6	0	0	2	0	47			2041-1723			WOS:000503000900001	31767845

In addition, Li-ion is observed to migrate from the TM(transition metal) layer to the AM(alkali metal) layer during the discharge process, and the O-O bond length becomes significantly shorter (similar to 2.41 angstrom) which suggests peroxo-like O-O dimers are formed. After the calculation of the O-2 evolution potential (>2.11 eV), it is found that O2- would not become O-2 to escape after the transformation from O2- to peroxide pair, which suggests that the redox of O is reversible.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0009-2614	1873-4448		WOS:000599846800001

Photocatalytic activity experiments demonstrated that the g-C3N4 synthesized from guanidine thiocyanate exhibited a much higher H-2 evolution rate than the reference sample prepared from dicyanamide. Further improvement in the activity was achieved by optimization of the condensation temperature. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the samples synthesized at a high temperature of 700 degrees C feature a high crystallinity and a low density of surface defects, with an enhanced optical absorbance extending to the visible light region. As a result, the sample prepared at 700 degrees C has been found to be 7 times more reactive towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution than the sample polymerized at the normal temperature of 550 degrees C. Other guanidine halides have also been applied to synthesize g-C3N4 materials, and the structure and activity of the resultant g-C3N4 were compared to the carbon nitride polymer from guanidine thiocyanate.									163	9	0	0	17	0	165			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000331248600012

The pure compounds were used, firstly, as sensitive materials for sensitive and selective optical and fluorescence detection of hydroquinone with the best results in the range 0.039-6.71 mu M and a detection limit of 0.013 mu M and, secondly, as corrosion inhibitors for carbon-steel (OL) in an acid medium giving a best performance of 88% in the case of coverings with Pt-porphyrin. Finally, the electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) of the free-base and Pt-metalated A(3)B porphyrins was evaluated in strong alkaline and acidic electrolyte solutions. The best results were obtained for the electrode modified with the metalated porphyrin, drop-casted on a graphite substrate from an N,N-dimethylformamide solution.

Herein, we report construction of Co3O4 quantum dots (QDs)/TiO2 nanobelts (NBs) hybrids via a facile hydrothermal method for simultaneous H-2 and O-2 productions from pure water, with high evolution rates of 41.8 and 22.0 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), respectively, which are significantly enhanced compared with TiO2 NBs and Co3O4 materials. The Co3O4 QDs not only improve light sensitivity but also change the work function of TiO2, promoting the transfer of electrons from TiO2 to Co3O4 QDs and H-2 generation on the surface of Co3O4 QDs. Moreover, the size effect of Co3O4 QDs (similar to 3 nm) facilitates the electron trapping due to the shorter pathway, and the generation of heterojunctions favors to suppress the recombination of photo-excited carries.									151	11	0	0	23	0	154			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000437965900040

The interaction between the nanodiamonds and the plasma was investigated as a function of the chamber pressure and the substrate temperature. At 40 Torr and 935 C, 90% of the seeds were etched, and growth induction occurred with an impractically long time of 23.5 h. Varying the substrate temperature between 827 C and 935 C did not lead to faster growth induction. Reducing the chamber pressure to 30 Torr instead resulted in continuous films with induction time as short as 12 min. The induction time and the growth rate exhibited an Arrhenius dependence in the temperature range 769-884 C with apparent activation energies of 3.7 eV/atom and 0.3 eV/atom, respectively. When at 30 Torr the concentration of the oxygen additive was raised to 1 vol%, the seeds were completely dissolved and no film deposition took place. However, film growth was possible with an oxygen admixture as high as 1.5 vol% on a diamond precursor layer of approximately 55 nm thickness, which was nucleated in an oxygen-free plasma.									1	0	0	0	0	1	1			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000762841300007

Herein, based on a feasible design idea, we fabricate an iron and oxygen co-doped nickel phosphide ((Fe0.1Ni0.9)(2)P(O)) by phosphating metal-organic framework (MOF) derivatives supported on nickel foam (NF) for efficient water splitting. In 1.0 M KOH, the (Fe0.1Ni0.9)(2)P(O)/NF electrode only requires an overpotential of 240 mV to reach 100 mA cm(-2) for the OER and 87 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER, respectively. Encouragingly, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled with the (Fe0.1Ni0.9)(2)P(O)/NF electrode can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an extremely low voltage of 1.50 V, which is one of the lowest values currently achievable with non-precious metal electrocatalysts. Undoubtedly, this work provides a novel and practical strategy to synthesize highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts based on MOF derivatives for overall water splitting and other electrocatalysis.									62	3	0	0	1	0	62			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200038

In this work, we designed an efficient photocatalyst by integrating lamellar oxygen-doped carbon nitride (CNO) nanosheets into ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) microflowers by a one-step hydrothermal method. A well-fitted 2D hierarchical hybrid heterostructure was fabricated. Under visible light irradiation, the ZIS@CNO composite with 40 wt% CNO (ZC 40%) showed the highest hydrogen evolution rate from water (188.4 mu mol.h(-1)), which was approximately 2.1 times higher than those of CNO and ZIS (88.6 and 90.2 mu mol.h(-1), respectively). Furthermore, the selective CO production rates of ZC 40% (12.69 mu mol.h(-1)) were 2.2 and 14.0 times higher than those of ZIS (5.85 mu mol.h(-1)) and CNO (0.91 mu mol.h(-1)), respectively, and the CH4 production rate of ZC 40% was 1.18 mu mol.h(-1). This enhanced photocatalytic activity of CNO@ZIS is due mainly to the formation of a heterostructure that can promote the transfer of photoinduced electrons and holes between CNO and ZIS, thereby efficiently avoiding recombination of electron-hole pairs.

Hydrogen and oxygen were obtained from water under argon atmosphere by sonophotocatalysis and each product was isolated using alternating irradiation method. This method involves irradiation in turn with ultrasound and light. Hydrogen was also isolated from sodium chloride solution, like seawater, using a similar technique. However, the ratio of products from NaCl solution was different from the ideal value. Chloride ions (Cl-) in the solution were activated to . Cl radicals by . OH radicals. which were produced from water by sonolysis. In other words, hydroxyl radicals( . OH) were scavenged by Cl- ions in the solution. When chloride ions (Cl-) are in the solution, it is thought that not only the amount of hydroxyl radicals ( . OH) but also hydrogen peroxide decreases. Due to decreasing H2O2 and/or . OH radicals, O-2 evolution rate would be expected to decrease. (C) 2001 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The structural evolution of the vitreous network was studied as a function of composition by thermal analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Raman scattering, high resolution P-31 solid state NMR and XANES at the W-L-1 absorption edge. For compositions with x ranging from 0 to 0.5 a pronounced increase in the glass transition temperature is observed, suggesting a significant increase in the glass network connectivity. At the same time Raman spectra indicate that tungsten atoms are linked to non-bridging oxygen atoms (W-O- or W=O bonded species) whereas the P-31 MAS-NMR spectra indicate the successive formation of new P-O-W linkages. The formation of some anionic tungsten sites (if these are revealed by the presence of W-O terminal bonds) implies an increase in the average degree of polymerization of the phosphate network, which is consistent with the compositional evolution of the P-31 MAS-NMR spectra at low x values. For higher x-values. the Raman spectra indicate the presence of W-O-W linkages. W-L-1 XANES data indicate that at least 90% of tungsten atoms are octahedrally coordinated. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still challenging to develop well-arrayed catalyst NPs on supports over multiple-length scales. Herein, we presented a facile strategy of producing well-ordered Pt-based NPs toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts assisted by the self-assembly of block copolymers. In contrast to the conventional Pt/C ORR catalysts with a random dispersion on carbon, the as-prepared Pt, PtCo, and PtCo@Pt NPs in our work were hexagonally arranged with a uniform quasi-spherical shape and ordered distribution. The systematic study related to their ORR activities revealed that the PtCo@Pt core-shell NP arrays were more active and more durable than PtCo, Pt, and the commercial Pt/C catalyst. In the rotating-disk electrode test, a half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.86 V versus RHE and a 4-e ORR mechanism were found for PtCo@Pt. Single-cell performance showed that the current density and the peak power density of PtCo@Pt achieved 0.86 A/cm(2)@0.7 V and 1.05 W/cm(2), respectively, with a Pt loading of similar to 0.15 mg/cm(2) on the cathode. Also, they held 81.4 and 82.9% retention, respectively, after the durability test in the single-cell test. Density functional theory calculation results revealed that PtCo@Pt NPs had a lower d-band center and a weaker oxygen binding energy compared to Pt and PtCo, which contributed to the enhancement of the ORR activity.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000687172000017	34355891

In this study, iron (III) metaphosphate/iron phosphide/partly-graphitized carbon ((Fe(PO3)(3))/FeP/PGC) catalysts obtained at 750-950 degrees C are used as air-cathode catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in single-chamber MFCs. As temperature increases, graphitization degree of carbon skeleton in (Fe(PO3)(3))/FeP/PGCs gradually increases to obtain a higher electrical conductivity. At 900 and 950 degrees C, monoclinic structured Fe(PO3)(3) is formed in PGC structure to constitute the Fe(PO3)(3)/FeP heterojunctions, which should originate from the partial oxidation of FeP. The maximum power density (1.162 +/- 0.022 Wm(-2)) of MFCs is obtained by Fe(PO3)(3)/FeP/PGC (900 degrees C) cathode, which is higher than that of commercial Pt/C (1.052 +/- 0.015Wm(-2)) and only has a decline of 4.56% after 1900 h operation (excellent durability). Well-dispersed Fe(PO3)(3)/FeP heterojunctions and abundant oxygen-containing groups (C-O-C, C-O-H and C-OH) play the important roles in achieving the high charge transfer efficiency (8.7 +/- 0.2 Omega) and long-term durability in bio-electricity generation. Fe(PO3)(3)/FeP/PGC (900 degrees C) primarily proceeds the efficient four-electron ORR pathway by exploiting the synergistic effects between the active components (Fe(PO3)(3)/FeP) and porous structure (533.77 m(2) g(-1)). This study provides the promising non-precious-metal ORR electro-catalysts for replacing Pt/C in renewable energy-generation systems.									25	1	0	0	6	0	26			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000440404800021

In this work, the sulfated TiO2 photocatalyst is successfully constructed in situ via a soft-templated method for photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen. The content of sulfate species in TiO2 can be tuned by changing the amount of the surfactant. The photocatalyst with the appropriate content of sulfate ions exhibits an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 3.9% at 365 nm and a high hydrogen production rate of 24.32 mmol h(-1) g(-1), which is 1.65 times that of commercial TiO2 (P25). The optimized photocatalyst has excellent photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution benefitting from the presence of sulfate ions on the surface of TiO2, large surface area and oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the rapid migration of photo-generated electrons to its surface and the improvement of the separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers. This work may inspire the rational design and the development of high-efficiency photocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100033	33367362

Titania hollow sphere particles were prepared using poly (styrene-methacrylic acid) latex as template material, and BaCl2 was used precursor material during barium doping over spheres. The morphology and structure of Ba/TiO2 hollow spheres were characterized by BET, XRD, TGA and TEM analysis. XRD results had confirmed the presence of rutile TiO2 and BaTiO3 phases in the catalysts. The catalysts have shown almost similar surface area values (around 97 m(2)/g) irrespective of their compositions. On the other hand, surface area values were diminished remarkably with rise in the calcination temperatures. In TEM images, hollow sphere formation with uniform layer of barium over the spheres could clearly be observed. Diameter of Ba-doped TiO2 hollow sphere was found 0.4-0.5 mu m irrespective of the variation in calcination temperatures. In cyclic voltammograms, both the hydrogen and oxygen evolution peaks were present for all the hollow sphere samples; although the peak positions had changed to some extent for few samples. Anodic polarization curves have shown 60 mA cm(-2) current density for 20 wt% Ba/TiO2 hollow sphere sample. Tafel slope is revealed as 122 mV for the same electrocatalyst. Barium doped titania hollow spheres have also shown long time electrocatalytic stability in acid solution. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Diatoms are a key component in the carbon (C) cycle, by taking up large amounts of anthropogenic CO2 through the biological carbon pump. In this study, we investigated the effects of Fe availability (no Fe and 4 nM FeCl3 addition) on the physiology of Chaetoceros cf. simplex, an ecologically relevant SO diatom. Our results are the first combining oxygen evolution and uptake rates with particulate organic carbon (POC) build up, pigments, photophysiological parameters and intracellular trace metal (TM) quotas in an Fe-deficient Antarctic diatom. Decreases in both oxygen evolution (through photosynthesis, P) and uptake (respiration, R) coincided with a lowered growth rate of Fe-deficient cells. In addition, cells displayed reduced electron transport rates (ETR) and chlorophyll a (Chla) content, resulting in reduced cellular POC formation. Interestingly, no differences were observed in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) or in the ratio of gross photosynthesis to respiration (GP:R). Furthermore, TM quotas were measured, which represent an important and rarely quantified parameter in previous studies. Cellular quotas of manganese, zinc, cobalt and copper remained unchanged while Fe quotas of Fe-deficient cells were reduced by 60% compared with High Fe cells. Based on our data, Fe-deficient Chaetoceros cf. simplex cells were able to efficiently acclimate to low Fe conditions, reducing their intracellular Fe concentrations, the number of functional reaction centers of photosystem II (RCII) and photosynthetic rates, thus avoiding light absorption rather than dissipating the energy through NPQ. Our results demonstrate how Chaetoceros cf. simplex can adapt their physiology to lowered assimilatory metabolism by decreasing respiratory losses.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0722-4060	1432-2056		WOS:000605101600001

In this study, the first high-entropy photocatalyst is synthesized by mechanical alloying via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method followed by high-temperature oxidation. The synthesized oxide contains 60 mol% of AB(2)O(7) monoclinic perovskite and 40 mol% of A(6)B(2)O(17) orthorhombic perovskite, where A represents Ti, Zr and Hf and B represents Nb and Ta. This two-phase oxide with an overall composition of TiHfZrNbTaO11 and a d(0) electronic configuration shows an appreciable light absorbance in the visible-light region with a bandgap of 2.9 eV and appropriate valence and conduction bands for water splitting. The material successfully produces hydrogen by photocatalytic water splitting, suggesting the potential of HEOs as new low-bandgap photocatalysts.									51	3	0	0	1	0	51			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521346600027

To this end, in this work, grain size, and hence the charge carrier migration path, is reduced by lowering the synthesis temperature of two-dimensional visible light-responsive La2NiO4 perovskite. Interestingly, the hydrogen yield for the piezoelectric response of La2NiO4 under only 40 kHz ultrasonic vibration is as high as 680 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 80 times that under only 600 mW cm(-2) visible light irradiation. More surprisingly, the hydrogen production rate under both light illumination and ultrasonic vibration is 129 times higher than under visible light irradiation alone. Clearly, a synergistic effect exists between piezocatalysis and photocatalysis. The hydrogen production activity of the samples with water splitting can reach 1097 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) without any sacrificial reagent or co-catalyst, when the light intensity reaches about 1000 mW cm(-2), which is a much higher hydrogen evolution rate by piezo-photocatalysis than is achieved by either piezocatalysis or photocatalysis individually. Further analysis indicates that the internal electric field generated by deformation of the La2NiO4 edge under piezoelectric action facilitates the directional separation and migration of photogenerated charges, which in turn significantly enhances the efficiency of use of photogenerated charges for hydrogen production. The investigation here provides a novel approach to design a new reaction system for hydrogen production by coupling multiple external physical fields.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000787850200001	35476112

This 3D architecture on glassy carbon electrode characterised systematically by voltammetry and other physical characterisation techniques like Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) etc,. Electrochemical Quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) studies helped out to calculate the total mass change during Co MnHCF formation. Electrochemical studies reveal that the formal redox potentials of both Co and MnHCF films remained close to that of newly formed Co MnHCF hybrid films. These 3D modified films were successfully applied for two different electrochemical applications i) For pseudocapacitor studies in KNO3 medium ii) Investigated the electrocatalytic behaviour of redox film towards water oxidation reaction in alkaline medium. Electrochemical performances of newly formed Co MnHCF are compared with their individual transition metal (Co, Mn) hexacyanoferrates. The resulting material shows a specific capacitance of 350 F g(-1) through its fast reversible redox reaction of electrochemically formed Co MnHCF modified film. Interestingly we showed the overpotential of 450 mV (from its thermodynamic voltage 1.2 V) to attain its optimum current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for O2 evolution in alkaline medium.

Here by means of density functional theory (DFT) computations, the formation configuration and CO2RR catalytic activity of boron nitrogen cluster-doped graphdiyne (BN-doped GDY) were systematically investigated. The band structure and optical adsorption spectra reveal that BN-doped GDY exhibits semiconductor with the band gap of 0.902 eV and shows photothermal effect under visible and even infrared light irradiation. The BN-doped GDY could act as a hot spot to enhance CO2RR. The adsorption configurations of various reaction intermediates indicate that boron atoms are active sites, which can be further confirmed by charge analysis. Based on thermodynamic analysis, the reaction pathways and onset potentials were studied as compared with Cu(111) surface. For the production of CO, the onset potential for BN-doped GDY (-1.06 V) is higher than that for Cu(111) surface. While for the reduction of CO(2)to HCOOH, CH4, CH3OH, and C(2)H(4)on BN-doped GDY, the onset potentials are lower than that on Cu(111) surface, which are -0.57 V, -0.62 V, -0.57 V, and -0.82 V, respectively. Moreover, the onset potential of competitive hydrogen evolution reaction on BN-doped GDY is high to -0.82 V, which shows us a good selectivity towards to CO2RR rather than HER. Our results may pave a new avenue for the conversion of CO(2)into high-value fuels and chemicals.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000576354200001	32990268

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization exhibited that the Ti/PANI-alpha-PbO2/PDMS-Ce-beta-PbO2 electrode (Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2) has denser surface morphology and smaller crystal size compared to the Ti/beta-PbO2 electrode (Ti/PbO2). The BET test showed that the specific surface area of the modified PbO2 electrode increased from 0.2591 to 0.2783 m(2) g(-1), which also means an increase in active sites. The results of linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) indicated that the Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2 electrode has higher oxygen evolution potential of 1.91 V vs.SCE than the Ti/PbO2 electrode (1.74 V vs.SCE), which can effectively reduce the impact of oxygen evolution side reaction on organic pollutants degradation. The fitting results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) exhibited that the impedance of the Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2 electrode was greatly reduced to 39.5 Omega. The modified electrode showed higher current efficiency in the experiment of electrochemical oxidation of gallic acid, proving that the electrocatalytic performance of the modified PbO2 electrode was further improved. Therefore, the Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2 electrode was used for sonoelectrochemical oxidation of aged landfill leachate. The effects of three key parameters on the sonoelectrochemical system were investigated, including current density, initial pH, and ultrasonic power, and the results revealed that the current density played a dominant role. Under the optimal parameters: 42 mA cm(-2) current density, initial pH of 6, 50 W ultrasonic power, 61.9% chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was achieved. Both the ten repeated experiments and the accelerated life tests demonstrate that Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2 electrode has good stability and potential for long-term application. Furthermore, the results of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) manifested that the sonoelectrochemical system with Ti/PANI/PDMS-Ce-PbO2 electrode will not cause secondary pollution to the effluent. The analysis results of ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) show that the organic components of the aged landfill leachate changed greatly after the treatment of sonoelectrochemical oxidation, and the refractory substances have been effectively removed.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000821433900002

The evolution of the bonding network in the pseudo-molecular CO2-II phase is found to point towards an incipient stabilization of six-fold coordinated carbon at high pressure (stishovite-like) as proposed by Iota et al. [V. Iota, C.-S. Yoo, J.-H. Klepeis, Z. Jenei, W. Evans, and H. Cynn, Nat. Mater. 6 (2007), pp. 34-38]. The relevance of secondary interactions in the polymerization is identified as a polarization of the oxygen lone pairs that gives rise to a synchronic birth of a new intermolecular C- O bond along with the weakening of the intramolecular (C= O) double bond. These results have been derived thanks to a new computational code developed in our laboratory that allows us to perform general topological analysis of the electron localization function in crystalline solids.					46th Annual Meeting of the European-High-Pressure-Research-Group Meeting (EHPRG 46)46th Annual Meeting of the European-High-Pressure-Research-Group Meeting (EHPRG 46)	SEP 07-12, 2008SEP 07-12, 2008		Valencia, SPAINValencia, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0895-7959	1477-2299		WOS:000264375400022

Pt-Pd eutectic alloy NPs was prepared by two-step chemical reduction, and was subsequently loaded on the surface of CdS photo-catalyst by photo induced electrons when water splitting reaction was occurring under 300 W Xe light (lambda > 420 nm). According to the experimental results, the photo-activity is significantly promoted as bi-metal modified on the surface of CdS. The H-2 evolution rate of Pt-Pd/CdS, 25.28 mmol/h/gCat., is ca. 2.4 times as much as that of Pt/CdS, and 3.8 times as much as that of Pd/CdS. HRTEM/ED/EDS revealed that the so-obtained Pt-Pd hybrid NPs with a particle size of 5-8 nm is of similar twin structure. XPS revealed that the as-prepared Pt-Pd bi-metal NPs mainly composed of metallic Pt-0 and Pd-0. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of CdS nanoparticles interpreted its trait in visible light adsorption, and PL lifetime indicated that the high active of Pt-Pd/CdS lies in its high separation efficiency. 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Converting solar energy to hydrogen using a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell is one of the most promising approaches to meet future energy demands. As an earth abundant metal oxide, tungsten trioxide (WO3), which has a moderate band gap (2.5-2.7 eV), ideal valence band position, and high resistance to photocorrosion, has been widely utilized in PEC photoanodes. To obtain a WO3 photoanode with high PEC efficiency, tremendous efforts have been made to improve the light absorption capacity, charge carrier dynamics, and oxygen evolution activity. In this report, the recent advances in WO3 photoanode optimization, including morphology design, dopants doping, heterojunction fabrication, and surface modification are summarized. In this review, these developments and representative applications of WO3 photoanodes in unassisted water splitting devices are also discussed. Finally, perspectives on the significant challenges and future prospects for the development of WO3 photoanodes for PEC water splitting are provided.									92	9	0	0	2	0	93			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000472676300010

The calculations are done within the framework of the distorted-wave Born approximation and the proton and neutron density distributions are evaluated adopting a relativistic Dirac-Hartree model. We present results for the elastic and quasi-elastic cross sections and for the parity-violating asymmetry. As a first step, the results of the models are tested in comparison with some of the data available for elastic and quasi-elastic scattering on O-16 and Ca-40 nuclei. Then, the evolution of some nuclear properties is investigated as a function of the neutron number. We also present a comparison with the parity-violating asymmetry parameter obtained by the PREX Collaboration on Pb-208 and give a prediction for the future experiment CREX on Ca-48.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000319654500005

An unappreciated uncertainty in these analyses is the input physics intrinsic to each SNe grid and its effect on stellar nucleosynthesis. We demonstrate how such uncertainties, coupled with the uncertain metal-poor halo star normalization, only allow us to set an approximate lower limit to m(u) of similar to 30 M-.; for reasonable IMF slopes, the allowable range is shown to be poorly constrained, with m(u) approximate to 30-200 M-..									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			0004-637X			WOS:000074853400022

PCC6803. The open reading frame is designated sll1926 in the complete Synechocystis gene sequence. The deduced amino acid sequence has no homologues in current sequence databases and no recognizable sequence motifs. It encodes a putative integral membrane protein of 16 kDa, which we have designated RpaC (regulator of phycobilisome association C). Fluorescence measurements of an insertional inactivation mutant of rpaC (Delta sll1926) show that it is specifically unable to perform state transitions. Delta sll1926 has approximately wild-type levels of PS1, PS2 and phycobilisomes. Measurements of oxygen evolution and uptake show Delta sll1926 to have no deficiency in electron transport rates. In vitro [gamma-P-32]-ATP labelling experiments suggest that RpaC is not the 15 kDa membrane phosphoprotein previously implicated in state transitions. Delta sll1926 grows more slowly than the wild type only at very low light intensities.									56	0	0	0	55	0	56			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:000082779700014	10476038

The gels offer chemical variety and hierarchically porous structures and are susceptible to modification via porphyrin metal centres. The Pd gel shows cathodic electrocatalytic activity to produce H-2 when coated on FTO electrodes. The gels are stable and active for visible-light driven hydrogen production in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor and a cocatalyst. Impregnation of the Pd metal centre greatly enhances the H-2 evolution rate. The Pd gel enables efficient photocatalytic H-2 evolution via photoinjection of electrons from the lightharvesting gel network into the Pt nanoparticles. When illuminated with visible light, the Pt-doped PdTAPP-TFPT gel produces hydrogen from aqueous sodium ascorbate solution without significant degradation during four runs (1.0744 x 10(5) mu mol g(-1) for 120 h totally). Interestingly the wet gels show remarkably higher H-2 production efficiency than their dried counterparts.									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000425302700037

The stability of such nanostructures is nevertheless speculative, and catalytically active species have been less explored. Herein, NiMoO4 nanorods and NiWO4 nanoparticles are prepared via a solvothermal route and deposited on nickel foam (NF) (NiMoO4/NF and NiWO4/NF). After ensuring the chemical and structural integrity of the catalysts on electrodes, an OER study has been performed in the alkaline medium. After a few cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles within the potential window of 1.0-1.9 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), ex situ Raman analysis of the electrodes infers the formation of NiO(OH)(ED) (ED: electrochemically derived) from NiMoO4 precatalyst, while NiWO4 remains stable. A controlled study, stirring of NiMoO4/NF in 1 M KOH without applied potential, confirms that NiMoO4 hydrolyzes to the isolable NiO, which under a potential bias converts into NiO(OH)(ED). Perhaps the more ionic character of the Ni-O-Mo bond in the NiMoO4 compared to the Ni-O-W bond in NiWO4 causes the transformation of NiMoO4 into NiO(OH)(ED). A comparison of the OER performance of electrochemically derived NiO(OH)(ED), NiWO4, ex-situ-prepared Ni(OH)(2), and NiO(OH) confirmed that in-situ-prepared NiO(OH)(ED) remained superior with a substantial potential of 238 (+/- 6) mV at 20 mA cm(-2). The notable electrochemical performance of NiO(OH)(ED) can be attributed to its low Tafel slope value (26 mV dec(-1)), high double-layer capacitance (C-dl, 1.21 mF cm(-2)), and a low charge-transfer resistance (R-ct, 1.76 Omega). The NiO(OH)(ED)/NF can further be fabricated as a durable OER anode to deliver a high current density of 25-100 mA cm(-2). Post-characterization of the anode proves the structural integrity of NiO(OH)(ED) even after 12 h of chronoamperometry at 1.595 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). The NiO(OH)(ED)/NF can be a compatible anode to construct an overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer that can operate at a cell potential of 1.64 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Similar to that on NF, NiMoO4 deposited on iron foam (IF) and carbon cloth (CC) also electrochemically converts into NiO(OH) to perform a similar OER activity. This work understandably demonstrates monoclinic NiMoO4 to be an inherently unstable electro(pre)catalyst, and its structural evolution to polycrystalline NiO(OH)(ED) succeeding the NiO phase is intrinsic to its superior activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000829343700001	35830301

At the same time, suitable amounts of coolants are added in order to govern the increase of the bath temperature and reduce the impurities (favoring the slag formation). The aim is to direct the bath of melted steel to the desired final condition, in terms of temperature and carbon content. At around 92-93% of the complete process of conversion, the oxygen blowing is suspended and the In-Blow is performed, i.e. a steel sample is collected by means of a lance introduced in the melted bath and its carbon percentage and temperature measured.A dynamic model, through two characteristic equations, describes the evolution of the carbon percentage and temperature of the melted steel during the final phase of the conversion process, i.e. from the In-Blow until the end. Based on this model, the volume of oxygen to be blown during this phase and the amount of coolant to be added in order to reach the required final (End-Point) conditions of carbon percentage and temperature can be calculated. The model is nonlinear and depends on four parameters to be estimated. Based on a dimensional analysis and on a large set of experimental data, the nominal model has been modified introducing the hypothesis that the parameters are not constant, but depend on the temperature. Within this framework the novel model is identified exploiting Least Squares (LS) methods and its output is compared with the existing practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, it has also been suggested that low atmospheric O-2 is one of the major drivers for at least two of the five mass-extinction events in the Phanerozoic. At the molecular level, our understanding of the responses of plants to sub-ambient O-2 concentrations is largely confined to studies of the responses of underground organs, e.g. roots to hypoxic conditions. Oxygen deprivation often results in elevated CO2 levels, particularly under waterlogged conditions, due to slower gas diffusion in water compared to air. In this study, changes in the transcriptome of gametophytes of the moss Physcomitrella patens arising from exposure to sub-ambient O-2 of 13% (oxygen deprivation) and elevated CO2 (1500 ppmV) were examined to further our understanding of the responses of lower plants to changes in atmospheric gaseous composition. Microarray analyses revealed that the expression of a large number of genes was affected under elevated CO2 (814 genes) and sub-ambient O-2 conditions (576 genes). Intriguingly, the expression of comparatively fewer numbers of genes (411 genes) was affected under a combination of both sub-ambient O-2 and elevated CO2 condition (low O-2-high CO2). Overall, the results point towards the effects of atmospheric changes in CO2 and O-2 on transcriptional reprogramming, photosynthetic regulation, carbon metabolism, and stress responses.									9	0	0	0	9	0	9			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000358533400027	25948702

Chen et al. (2003) Planta 218:98-106] reported on the genomic, proteomic, phylogenetic and evolutionary aspects of a putative nuclear gene (SulP) encoding a chloroplast sulfate permease in the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In this article, evidence is provided for the envelope localization of the SulP protein and its function in the uptake and assimilation of sulfate by the chloroplast. Localization of the SulP protein in the chloroplast envelope was concluded upon isolation of C. reinhardtii chloroplasts, followed by fractionation into envelope and thylakoid membranes and Western blotting of these fractions with specific polyclonal antibodies raised against the recombinant SulP protein. The function of the SulP protein was probed in antisense transformants of C. reinhardtii having lower expression levels of the SulP gene. Results showed that cellular sulfate uptake capacity was lowered as a consequence of attenuated SulP gene expression in the cell, directly affecting rates of de novo protein biosynthesis in the chloroplast. The antisense transformants exhibited phenotypes of sulfate-deprived cells, displaying slow rates of light-saturated oxygen evolution, low levels of Rubisco in the chloroplast and low steady-state levels of the photosystem-II D1 reaction-center protein. The role of the chloroplast sulfate transport in the uptake and assimilation of sulfate in C. reinhardtii is discussed along with its impact on the repair of photosystem-II from a frequently occurring photo-oxidative damage and potential use for the elucidation of the H-2-evolution-related metabolism in this green alga.									30	1	0	0	27	0	36			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000225521200002	15278455

This combination boosts the H-2 evolution rate to an outstanding value of 894 mu mol h(-1) g(-1) under visible-light irradiation, which is among the highest H-2 evolution rates reported to date for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The H-2 generation rate exhibited by Ni2P/MIL-125-NH2 is almost 3 times higher than that of the Pt/MIL-125-NH2 system, highlighting the impact of the co-catalyst on photocatalytic water splitting. Additionally, our system outperforms the Ni2P/TiO2 system under UV-vis irradiation. The exceptional performance of Ni2P/MIL-125-NH2 is due to the efficient transfer of photogenerated electrons from MIL-125-NH2 to Ni2P, high intrinsic activity of Ni2P and exceptional synergy between them. This system exhibits the highest apparent quantum yields of 27.0 and 6.6% at 400 and 450 nm, respectively, ever reported for MOFs.									62	3	0	0	7	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000424466300007		
J	Xue, Xingyu; Caton, Jerald A.								Nitric oxide and soot emissions determined from a multi-zone thermodynamic direct-injection diesel engine combustion model								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH				15	2			135	152		10.1177/1468087412466253				FEB 2014	2014	A three-step phenomenological soot model and a nitric oxide emission model have been developed by applying the current understanding of conceptual models for direct-injection diesel engine combustion processes. The three-step soot model incorporates the physical processes of fuel pyrolysis, soot inception and soot oxidation. The nitric oxide model is governed by the Zeldovich (thermal) mechanism and N2O intermediate mechanism. With the local information provided by the previously developed multi-zone thermodynamic diesel engine combustion model, the emission models can be successfully applied via specific detection concerning where and when each of these reactions mainly occur within the diesel fuel jet evolution process. The simulation was completed for a 4.5-L, inline four-cylinder diesel engine. The results demonstrated that this method, which incorporates emission models into the developed multi-zone diesel engine combustion model, has the potential to qualitatively predict the effects of various engine parameters on the engine-out soot and nitric oxide emissions. The results showed that advanced injection timing and higher injection pressure lead to the increase of nitric oxide concentration because of not only the increased residence time but also the higher entrainment rate of fresh gas into combustion products. Soot formed in-cylinder decreases with increasing injection pressure and advanced start of injection timing mainly due to the extension of the lift-off length and lower local equivalence ratio. In spite of decreased ambient oxygen concentration, the extended lift-off length and the reduced combustion temperature contribute to the reduction of soot formation under heavy exhaust gas recirculation levels.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1468-0874	2041-3149		WOS:000335809700001

First-principles calculations show that the N dopants promote the substitution of Ti with Ru on the anatase TiO2(101) surface by chemical bonding between Ru and N, and increase the stability of the system. Isolated Ru-1 atoms act as active sites for the reduction of protons, and Ru-1-N-1/TiO2 has a hydrogen evolution activity comparable to that of Pd. The impurity bands within the band gap lead to a significant red-shift of the absorption edge towards the visible region, improving the photoabsorption and photocatalytic performance of TiO2 under sunlight. The reason is the charge compensation effect localized to the doped Ru-N dimers. We expect that this generic scheme that simultaneously realizes band-structure tailoring and reaction control also applies to other single-atom loaded oxide-based photocatalytic systems.									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000538039300017	32374318

The Co-Pi cocatalyst couples effectively to photoholes generated in the surface polyheptazine layer of the TiO2PH photoanode, as evidenced by complete photooxidation of water to oxygen under visible-light (?>420 nm) irradiation at moderate bias potentials. In addition, the presence of the cocatalyst also reduces significantly the recombination of photogenerated charges, particularly at low bias potentials, which is ascribed to better photooxidation kinetics resulting in lower accumulation of holes. This suggests that further improvements of photoconversion efficiency can be achieved if more effective catalytic sites for water oxidation are introduced to the surface structure of the hybrid photoanodes.									51	1	0	0	3	0	51			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000307841900020	22488957

The films were prepared on etched Al foil samples by ZrO2 sol-gel coating and anodizing. To inhibit O-2 evolution during anodization, 2-methyl-1, 3-propanediol (MPD) was used with boric acid solution as an electrolyte. In this study, we investigated the effects of the ratio of MPD in boric acid solution on the anodizing behaviors and electrical properties of ZrO2-coated Al foil. The thickness of the Al2O3 layer decreased as the MPD ratio increased. The MPD-boric acid solution effectively inhibited O-2 evolution. The samples anodized in MPD-boric acid electrolyte with a ratio of 3:10 (volume %) exhibited the highest specific capacitance. Relative to those of samples anodized in boric acid solution, the specific capacitances of samples analyzed in the MPD-boric acid electrolyte increased by 45.5% at 700 V, 40.0% at 800 V, and 66.7% at 900 V.

Despite numerous efforts on M-N-Cs, attaining both adequate activity and a satisfactory stability simultaneously is a principal issue. Herein, we demonstrated the synthesis of a single-atom tungsten catalyst supported on the N-doped carbon matrix (W-N-C) and its application as an ORR catalyst. W-N-C was synthesized using the economically viable, simple, one-step pyrolysis of dicyandiamide and tungsten(VI) chloride at moderate temperature (700 degrees C). The synthesis of W-N-C avoids any post acid treatment as it does not require any subsidiary sacrificial metal like Zn and, hence, does not induce any burden associated with chemical waste management. The atomic dispersion of W atoms stabilized by N-doped porous carbon and the formation of WN2C2 were confirmed by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Interestingly, as-synthesized WN2C2 exhibited unprecedented electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 764 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) as well as significantly enhanced stability (retaining >99% diffusion-limited current density and the loss in activity is 10.5% at 0.84 V after 10,000 potential cycles), which is much better than the stability limit set by the US Department of Energy in an alkaline medium. Overall, the activity of W-N-C surpasses that of Pt/C after 5000 cycles. The excellent stability is believed to be due to the symmetric coordination of the metal active site (W2N2C2).									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000577111700024	32867468

We find that Ir on vertical graphene (Ir_ VG) is an all- round bifunctional catalyst. A high content of metallic Ir (Ir0) manifests as active catalytic sites supported by a superaerophobic vertical graphene surface designed to facilitate two-/four- electron transfer processes. This binder- free, nanoscale hybrid catalyst yields low overpotentials for the HER and OER in both acidic and alkaline media. With aminimal catalyst loading of 50 mg cm 2 for the HER, the catalyst delivers a current density of 10 mA cm 2 at overpotentials of 47 mV and 17 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. For the OER, the catalyst achieves a current density of 10 mA cm 2 at overpotentials of 300 mV and 320 mV in acidic and alkaline media, respectively. This highly active bi- functional catalyst enables total water splitting at 1.58 V (acidic) and 1.57 V (alkaline) for 10 mA cm 2. Unlike other catalysts, Ir_ VG shows good stability against corrosion with undiminished current density even at high potential in harsh acidic or alkaline environments over 24 h. This unprecedented, versatile catalyst offers an appealing, cost- effective noble- metal- based scheme for pHindependent water electrolysis.									36	0	0	0	2	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000488618600011

In this study, pristine carbon nanotube (CNT) is easily modified to form the graphene nanoclusters-CNT (GN-CNT) composite with rich active N species via a facile and one-step energetic material (NaN3) deflagration method for the first time. Thanks to the controllable introduction of defects/edges into the CNT structure during the ultrafast (< 1 s) deflagration reaction, the active N species (graphitic N and pyridinic N) can be doped more susceptibly and account for as high as 85% of the total N content (> 5 at%) in the product, which leads to an excellent ORR performance of the prepared catalyst. An optimized GN-CNT sample is capable of achieving an excellent ORR performance with the half-wave potential of 0.84 V (300 mV positive than Pt/C) and limiting current density of - 5.5 mA.cm(-2) (similar to 10% higher than Pt/C). In addition, the prepared catalysts also show significant higher intrinsic catalytic activity, long-term stability and methanol tolerance than commercial Pt/C. Such an energetic material induced deflagration method may provide a rapid, one-step and controllable way to effectively modify or synthesize other N-doped functional materials which can be widely used in the field of catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000604558800005

The flexible working electrode was fabricated using thoroughly analyzed S/N-CLs composite as an active electrode energy material for supercapacitor and HER. The S/N-CLs composite shows a higher specific capacitance of 266 F g(-1) at a current density of 0.5 A g(-1) and a satisfied cycling stability with 84% capacitance retention even after 5000 cycles of galvanostatic charge-discharge. On the other hand, the synthesized S/N-CLs composite was used as an electrocatalyst for HER and it exhibits an excellent HER performance with an onset overpotential of -75 mV, and a Tafel slope of 73 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Also, the S/N-CLs composite displayed good stability and strong durability. The high electrocatalytic activity and stability of S/N-CLs composite toward HER due to the active site of a compound which may originate from the heteroatom-functional groups including N and S in the carbon structure. Overall, the high-performance supercapacitors and enhancing HER based on heteroatom-doped carbon structures could be promising in replacing traditional supercapacitors for many electronic devices and electrocatalyst for HER.									33	0	0	0	2	0	33			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000456759900043

Oxygenation of graphene creates a bandgap to produce semiconducting graphene oxide, nitrogen doping extends the resonant -conjugation to prolong the charge lifetime, and sulfur doping breaks the electron neutrality to facilitate charge transfer. Accordingly, ammonia-treated sulfur-nitrogen-co-doped graphene oxide dots (A-SNGODs) are synthesized by annealing graphene oxide sheets in sulfur-ammonia, oxidizing the sheets into dots, and then hydrothermally treating the dots in ammonia. The A-SNGODs exhibit a high nitrogen content in terms of quaternary and amide groups that are formed through sulfur-mediated reactions. The peripheral amide facilitates orbital conjugations to enhance the photocatalytic activity, whereas the quaternary nitrogen patches vacancy defects to improve stability. The simultaneous presence of electron-withdrawing S and electron-donating N atoms in the A-SNGODs facilitates charge separation and results in reactive electrons. When suspended in an aqueous triethanolamine solution, Pt-deposited A-SNGODs demonstrate a hydrogen-evolution quantum yield of 29% under monochromatic 420 nm irradiation. The A-SNGODs exhibit little activity decay under 6-day visible-light irradiation. This study demonstrates the excellence of the heteroatom-doping strategy in producing stable and active graphene-based materials for photoenergy conversion.									19	3	0	0	4	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000434692000047	29845156	
J	Sawai, K; Suzuki, N								Heat-treated transition metal hexacyanometallates as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction insensitive to methanol								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				151	5			A682	A688		10.1149/1.1690287				2004	2004	Highly active catalysts for electrochemical reduction of oxygen insensitive to the presence of methanol were prepared from transition metal hexacyanometallate precursors by heat-treatment with carbon black under an inert atmosphere. The catalytic activity for oxygen reduction was examined with the floating electrode technique under an air atmosphere at room temperature. The electrolyte used in most of the measurements was 1 M sodium phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.5), whereas acid and alkaline solutions were also used in addition to the neutral buffer solution to examine the catalytic activity of the prepared catalyst over a wide range of pH. Remarkable enhancements in the catalytic activity were observed for samples heat-treated at temperatures higher than 500degreesC. Among several 3d-transition metals incorporated in the inorganic precursor, the combination of cobalt and iron incorporated at neighboring sites gave the highest activity, comparable to that of platinum black catalyst (Pt/C). The catalytic activity for oxygen reduction was not affected by the presence of 2.5 M methanol in the electrolyte, while that of Pt/C was severely impaired by the presence of methanol. The catalysts prepared from the inorganic precursors were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared (IR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The XRD and IR data indicated that the cyanide structure of the inorganic precursor was decomposed when heating beyond 500degreesC. The XPS data indicated that the oxidation states of cobalt and iron are close to metallic ones and two types of nitrogen forming new bonding are present in the heat-treated samples. The same structural and spectral changes were observed for samples heat-treated without carbon black. From these results, the evolution of the high catalytic activity by heat-treating the inorganic precursors is discussed.

Two-dimensional (2D) layered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), known to contain active edge sites and a chemically inert basal plane, has provided great promise as a non-precious alternative to platinum-based catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production from water. Here, we directly synthesize fractal-shaped single-layer MoS2 with large tensile strain on fused silica. The as-synthesized MoS2 with a large amount of exposed edge sites is superior to the triangle-shaped MoS2 grown on SiO2 for catalyzing HER. By controlling the MoS2 grain size and coverage, etc., we identify the active sites of the MoS2. Electrocatalytic activity of the MoS2 for the HER correlates linearly with the number of edge sites with an enhanced activity of similar to 2.74 x 10(-7) mu A mu m(-1), due to the increased supplying of electrons to the active edge sites caused by the large tensile strain. The optimal HER electrocatalyst of the fractal-shaped single-layer MoS2, which has an edge-to-substrate ratio of about 0.33 mu m(-1), exhibits superior HER catalytic activities such as a low overpotential of 185 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 45 mV/dec, an exchange current density of 50.9 mu A cm(-2), and long-term stability. The present study provides new ways to design 2D HER electrocatalysts, including controlling the geometry, strain, and modulating the electrical conductivity.									72	3	0	0	2	0	74			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000440682100087

A furnace annealing (FA) treatment was applied to the as-grown thin films to initiate solid-phase crystallization (SPC) in nitrogen atmosphere and oxygen atmosphere. Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the crystallization and grain growth behaviors in the annealed films in N-2. The crystalline fraction of the annealed films can reach similar to 80%, and a grain size of up to 17 nm can be obtained from the FA treatment at high temperatures. The surface morphologies and microstructures of annealed films were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The evolution of crystallization with the nucleation and grain growth processes in the annealed film was described by classical thermal kinetics. The activation energies for the incubation time and grain growth of the ECRCVD film were 3.51 +/- 0.09 eV and 2.54 +/- 0.13 eV, respectively. The results indicate that the ECRCVD deposited films exhibited more voids which would lead to lower nucleation barrier for crystallization and faster rate for grain growth when compared to other different fabrication methods. This was also the reason for the ease of grain growth. Furthermore, the chemical states of silicon in thermally oxidized a-Si:H films were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The crystalline fraction of annealed films in oxygen atmosphere is higher than that of film in nitrogen atmosphere due to the Si daggling bonds easily form bonding reaction with O atoms for the amorphous phase in oxygen atmosphere. Overall this study provided not only a better understanding of crystallization kinetics in ECRCVD-grown a-Si:H films in N-2 vs. O-2 atmosphere but also this investigation provided a good understanding on the enhancing effect of crystallization behavior related to mechanism and characteristics of ECRCVD-grown a-Si:H films being oxidized at high annealing temperatures.

Physiological relevance and functional connection to photosystems								BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOENERGETICS				1837	6			734	743		10.1016/j.bbabio.2014.01.012				JUN 2014	2014	Chromera velia is an alveolate alga associated with scleractinian corals. Here we present detailed work on chromatic adaptation in C velia cultured under either blue or red light. Growth of C velia under red light induced the accumulation of a light harvesting antenna complex exhibiting unusual spectroscopic properties with red-shifted absorption and atypical 710 nm fluorescence emission at room temperature. Due to these characteristic features the complex was designated "Red-shifted Chromera light harvesting complex" (Red-CLH complex). Its detailed biochemical survey is described in the accompanying paper (Bina et al. 2013, this issue).Here, we show that the accumulation of Red-CLH complex under red light represents a slow acclimation process (days) that is reversible with much faster kinetics (hours) under blue light. This chromatic adaptation allows C. velia to maintain all important parameters of photosynthesis constant under both light colors. We further demonstrated that the C velia Red-CLH complex is assembled from a 17 kDa antenna protein and is functionally connected to photosystem II as it shows variability of chlorophyll fluorescence. Red-CLH also serves as an additional locus for non-photochemical quenching. Although overall rates of oxygen evolution and carbon fixation were similar for both blue and red light conditions, the presence of Red-CLH in C velia cells increases the light harvesting potential of photosystem II, which manifested as a doubled oxygen evolution rate at illumination above 695 nm. This data demonstrates a remarkable long-term remodeling of C velia light-harvesting system according to light quality and suggests physiological significance of 'red' antenna complexes.

Water electrolysis is a green method for hydrogen production and simple technology that produces very clean gases. However, the main problems with this method are that this process possesses slow kinetic, consumes many energies and its common electrocatalyst is platinum (Pt) based which is an expensive and rare substance. The use of accessible electrocatalyst materials with new shape or structure, which can reduce the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of the electrolyzers. Herein, first, a graphite sheet was modified with graphene oxide (GO) and then a hyperbranched structure of gold was electrodeposited on it by controlling the electrodeposition conditions. The electrode surface was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The HER performance of the prepared electrodes was evaluated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The as-prepared electrode revealed outstanding HER performance with a near-zero onset overpotential (4.7 mV), overpotential of 44 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a high current density of 127.9 mA cm(-2) at 200 mV and also satisfactory stability. Such results suggest that this electrocatalyst is promising for generating clean energy on an industrial scale. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Photosystem II membranes were treated with 1-ethyl-3-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide which cross-links amino groups to carboxyl groups which are in van der Waals contact. This treatment did not affect the oxygen evolution rates of these membranes and increased the retention of oxygen evolution after CaCl2 washing. Analysis of the proteins cross-linked by this treatment indicated that two cross-linked species with apparent molecular masses of 95 and 110 kDa were formed which cross-reacted with antibodies against both the 33-kDa manganese-stabilizing protein and the chlorophyll protein CPa-1. Cleavage of the 110-kDa cross-linked species with cyanogen bromide followed by N-terminal sequence analysis was used to identify the peptide fragments of CPa-1 and the manganese-stabilizing protein which were cross-linked. Two cyanogen bromide fragments were identified with apparent molecular masses of 50 and 25 kDa. N-Terminal sequence analysis of the 50-kDa cyanogen bromide fragment indicates that this consists of the C-terminal 16.7-kDa fragment of CPa-1 and the intact manganese-stabilizing protein. This strongly suggests that the manganese-stabilizing protein is cross-linked to the large extrinsic loop domain of CPa-1. N-Terminal analysis of the 25-kDa cyanogen bromide fragment indicates that this consists of the C-terminal 16.7-kDa peptide of CPa-1 and the N-terminal 8-kDa peptide of the manganese-stabilizing protein. These results indicate that the domain 364E-440D of CPa-1 is cross-linked to the domain 1E-76K of the manganese-stabilizing protein. The large extrinsic loop domain of CPa-1 thus appears to anchor the manganese-stabilizing protein to the photosynthetic membrane via a charge-pair interaction.									79	2	0	0	71	0	81			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JA43200027	1610808

The industrial viability of the process strongly depends on cathode electrocatalyst. However, current catalysts rely on rare, noble metals and their composite. Thus, it remains a great challenge of cost-effective catalyst with both high activity and selectivity. Herein, we made use of extremely low-cost fungi residue biomass, developing a multi-non-precious metal doped carbon catalyst (named as FRC) for H2O2 electrogeneration by facile in-situ synthesis. The one-step prepared FRC balances the performance of different metal oxides and exhibits not only high activity but also high selectivity at a spacious potential range. Specifically, the current density for ring reaches 0.45 mA cm(-2) at -0.5 V (vs SCE). Besides, the selectivity achieves 98% and remain above 91% in wide potential range (-0.7 similar to -0.3 V), which exceeds almost all metal contained carbon materials to our knowledge. As the first study of fungi residue towards H2O2 electrogeneration, this novel approach provides a highly promising and low cost electrocatalyst for real production, moreover, exploring a new direction for H2O2 electrocatalyst development.

Iron nitride has emerged as a promising catalyst for its cost-effective nature, but the corresponding acidic stability must be promoted. Herein, phosphorus-decorated Fe2N and reduced graphene oxide (P-Fe2N/rGO) composite are designed and synthesized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) show that a thin layer amorphous iron phosphide is coated on the surface of Fe2N nanoparticles, which could be responsible for the well resistance of chemical corrosion in acidic media. Meanwhile, the P-decoration could tune the electronic state and coordination environment of iron atom as evidenced by XAFS, resulting in dramatically enhanced electrocatalytic activity of P-Fe2N/rGO. Density functional theory calculations reveal that both the P-connected N atoms and the Fe atoms in P-Fe2N/rGO catalyst are the main active sites for H* adsorption. The hydrogen-binding free energy vertical bar Delta G(H)*vertical bar value is close to zero for P-Fe2N/rGO, suggesting a good balance between the Volmer and Heyrovsky/Tafel steps in HER kinetics. As expected, P-Fe2N/rGO catalyst could achieve a low eta(onset) of 22.4 mV, a small Tafel plot of 48.7 mV dec(-1), and remarkable stability for HER in acid electrolyte.									60	1	0	0	1	0	60			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000443012700009	30073797

The second and third residues, proline and valine, respectively, have also been mutated, Y1P is the only strain that did not grow photoautotrophically. The other strains show cytochrome b(6)f complex/photosystem I reaction center chlorophyll, photosystem I unit size and chlorophyll a+b/cell ratios comparable with wild-type cells. Rates of cytochrome f photooxidation in all strains were similar (t(1/2) congruent to 300 mu s), whereas the rate of re-reduction sensitive to stigmatellin (at E(h) = 0 mV, (where E(h) is the ambient redox potential) for wild-type, Y1W, Y1F, Y1S, P2V, and V3P had a t(1/2) of 3, 4, 5, 9, 40, and 2 ms, respectively. Rates of oxygen evolution by whole cells of P2V, Y1F, and Y1S were 67, 80, and 80% of wild-type rates, respectively. At low light intensity, all competent strains had the same growth rate whereas at saturating intensities, only P2V showed a significant inhibition. These results are considered in relation to structure function relationships in the cytochrome f molecule.									28	0	0	0	23	0	28			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1996UA36300043	8626414

Identification of host factors that interact with viral proteins is a fundamental step to understand the pathogenesis of PCV2. Our previous study reported that ORF5, a newly identified PCV2 viral protein supports PCV2 replication and interacts with multiple host factors. Here, we showed that a host factor YWHAB is an ORF5-interacting protein and plays essential roles during PCV2 infection. By using protein-protein interaction assays, we confirmed that YWHAB directly interacts with PCV2-ORF5 protein. We further showed that YWHAB expression was potently induced upon ORF5 overexpression and PCV2 infection. Remarkably, we found that the YWHAB strongly inhibited PCV2 replication, suggesting its role in defending PCV2 infection. By using the ectopic overexpression and gene knockdown approaches, we revealed that YWHAB inhibits PCV2-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), autophagy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis, suggesting its vital role in alleviating PCV2-induced cellular damage. Together, this study demonstrated that an ORF5-interacting host factor YWHAB affects PCV2 infection and PCV2-induced cellular response, which expands the current understanding of YWHAB biological function and might serves as a new therapeutic target to manage PCV2 infection-associated diseases.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0378-1135	1873-2542		WOS:000596517800007	33096469

The prepared sample 6Cu-NM-101 exhibited the best hydrogen evolution activity of 5770.96 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), which was 4.06 times higher than the original NH2-MIL-101(Fe). A series of characterization tests, especially the CV and the Auger Cu LMM, demonstrated that the transient Cu-II/Cu-I center played a significant part in the novel ligand to linker metal charge transfer (LLMCT) process. In other words, the electrons could transfer from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the excited state Eosin Y (EY*) to the transient Cu-II/Cu-I center to further accelerate the carrier transfer and separation rate. Our work provided a more convenient and effective strategy to prepare various earth-abundant metal ions based on MOFs as low-cost cocatalysts via transient metal centers to boost the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

Nevertheless, simultaneously optimizing each of these processes represents a materials conundrum owing to conflicting requirements of materials attributes at the electrode surface. Here we show an approach that can circumvent these challenges by collaboratively exploiting corrosion-resistant surface stoichiometry and structurally-tailored reactive interface. Nanoporous, density-graded surface of 'black' gallium indium phosphide (GaInP2), when combined with ammonium-sulfide-based surface passivation, effectively reduces reflection and surface recombination of photogenerated carriers for high efficiency photocatalysis in the hydrogen evolution half-reaction, but also augments electrochemical durability with lifetime over 124 h via strongly suppressed kinetics of corrosion. Such synergistic control of stoichiometry and structure at the reactive interface provides a practical pathway to concurrently enhance efficiency and durability of semiconductor photoelectrodes without solely relying on the development of new protective materials.									31	0	1	0	3	0	32			2041-1723			WOS:000477706400003	31358745

The catalytic activity of the coatings for the hydrogen evolution process was investigated in 6 M KOH electrolyte. The thin films were deposited from baths containing a mixture of Co2+, Ni2+, and Rh3+ chloride complexes. A wide range of alloy compositions were achieved by applying different deposition potentials from -0.5 to -0.9 V vs SCE. The obtained coatings were examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The surface morphology and chemical composition were also characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with EDX. The hydrogen evolution activity of some selected electrodes were examined in 6 M KOH using current-potential curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The SEM results showed that the surface morphology of the electrodes can be tailored by modification of the deposition potential. The higher exchange current densities were observed in catalytic measurements for the ternary alloys, which confirms their better catalytic activity in the water-splitting process.

Ultrathin PdFePb nanowires (NWs) with an average diameter of 2.3 nm were synthesized by a simple and fast one-pot aqueous synthesis, using octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (NP-40) as the structure-directing agent. The as-prepared PdFePb NWs displayed an increscent electrochemically active surface area (ECSA, 121.18 m(2) g(-1) (Pd)). For ethylene glycol oxidation reaction (EGOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), PdFePb NWs exhibited much higher activity and superior stability, outperforming those of homemade PdFe NWs, PdPb NWs, commercial Pd black and Pd/C (20 wt%). These results reveal dramatically high catalytic activity and durability of ultrathin PdFePb NWs in enhancing polyols electrooxidation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

That paper showed a remarkable 48% increase in power density while switching from common GDC interlayer to a new interlayer chemistry (PGCO). Furthermore, a stable long-term performance was linked with suppressed reaction between the cathode and PGCO interlayer. In this paper, we report in situ studies of the phase evolution. The high energy XRD studies at a synchrotron source showed fully suppressed phase transition in praseodymium nickelates with PGCO interlayer, while the electrodes with GDC interlayer undergo substantial phase transformation. Furthermore, in operando and post XRD analyses showed fully suppressed structural changes in electrodes operated in full cells at 750 degrees C and 0.80 V for 500 hours. SEM-EDS analysis showed that the formation of PrOx at the cathode-interlayer interface may play a role in a decrease of mechanical integrity of the interfaces, due to thermal expansion mismatch, leading to a local stress between the two phases. Consequently, phase evolution at a narrow interface may propagate towards the electrode bulk, leading to structural changes and performance degradation.					15th International Symposium on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)15th International Symposium on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)	JUL 23-28, 2017JUL 23-28, 2017	Electrochem Soc Inc; SOFC Soc Japan; Electrochem Soc, High Temp MatElectrochem Soc Inc; SOFC Soc Japan; Electrochem Soc, High Temp Mat	Hollywood, FLHollywood, FL	1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-60768-815-0	WOS:000432566701062

In oxide ceramics, oxygen vacancies have an important effect on degradation behaviors. X-ray diffraction was employed to analyze the occupancy of Ca2+ in the Ba sites or Ti sites with different BCG contents. For the light-doped, Ca2+ mainly occupy the Ba sites resulting in a decrease of lattice parameters and thus an increase in the enthalpy of reduction which might limit the concentration of oxygen vacancies. However, acceptor defects, CaTi which could trap the forming electrons at room temperature but deteriorate the resistance degradation behavior at high temperature, would be generated with excessive BCG contents. Moreover, thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) analysis was carried out to analyze the defect relaxation behavior and the actual concentration. The resistance degradation can be correlated with the depolarization current strength (J(max)) and the relaxation temperature (T-m) versus polarization condition.

In this study, pure-phase Cu11V6O26 thin film photoanodes were prepared on a FTO-coated glass substrate for the first time by a low-cost solution-based spray pyrolysis method. The optical bandgap, band positions, flatband potential, chemical composition, photocurrent onset potential, photocurrent generation, incident photon to current conversion efficiency, photoelectrochemical stability, and O-2 production Faradic efficiency of Cu11V6O26 were systematically researched. UV-vis results showed that Cu11V6O26 has an ideal bandgap of similar to 1.85 eV, which corresponds to a theoretical photocurrent of up to 15 mA/cm(2) for solar water splitting. Photoelectrochemical measurements showed the onset of a photoanodic current driven under AM 1.5 illumination and reaching incident-photon-to-current efficiencies exceeding similar to 4% in near-neutral (pH 6.8) aqueous solutions. Meanwhile, the Cu11V6O26 photoelectrodes showed excellent photoelectrochemical stability and nearly quantitative Faradic efficiency, which suggest that Cu11V6O26 could be a promising photoanode material. The results of this study will significantly increase our fundamental understanding of Cu11V6O26 performance in solar water splitting reactions. Moreover, these data could be transferred to other ternary metal oxides for the same applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000835367500001

However, traditional MOFs suffer from poor conductivity and low stability, which limit their efficiency in catalysis and other applications that require good electrical conduction. To overcome this limitation, a composite made of electrically conducting graphene and MOFs is conceptually a viable solution. This review summarizes the latest preparation methods for MOF/graphene materials with a focus on applications in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. We aim to assist existing researchers to obtain a fast and holistic overview of MOF and their derivatives with graphene composites in catalysis, and also the new comers to quickly catch up with the latest development in this field.									99	5	0	0	18	0	101			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521938400004

For the first time, the film capacities have been corrected for the oxygen evolution side reaction, and the data used as input into a point defect-containing structural model to track the changes that occur during short-term cycling. Variations in capacity and mass during formation and charge/discharge cycling are related to changes in the point defect parameters, thus providing a structural origin for the unique experimental variations observed here and often reported in the literature, but previously unexplained. Proton-, potassium-, and water-content vary in the active material during charge/discharge cycling. The observed capacity loss, or "capacity fade,'' is explained by incomplete incorporation of potassium ions in ( or near) the nickel vacancy during charge, as additional protons are then allowed to occupy the vacant lattice site. The increase in water content during reduction parallels the expansion of the electrode that is well known during cycling. This result confirms the origin of the swelling phenomenon as being caused by water incorporation. The model and methodology developed in this paper can be used to correlate electrochemical signatures with material chemical structure.									10	0	0	0	0	1	10			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000226895800001

A catalytic metal/based film was obtained by means of anodic oxidation of metallic nanoparticles, namely carbon-coated cobalt nanoparticles or carbon-coated nickel nanoparticles. Interestingly, these particles are intrinsically conductive and possess magnetic properties which make it easy to collect them on an electrode surface using a simple magnet to form a porous conductive particulate film. Upon anodic polarization in an appropriate electrolyte, the particulate film is rapidly converted into an amorphous metal-based catalytic film that efficiently catalyzes the oxidation of water at neutral pH. Compared to Nocera's method based on anodic electrodeposition of a metal salt in solution, this new electrodeposition strategy offers the key advantage of supplying metal ions in a solid and metallic form, leading to a fast release of high local concentrations of metal ions right at the spot of the film formation (i.e., in the vicinity of the electrode surface). This plays a decisive role in the formation rate of the catalytic film, allowing the deposition of the oxygen-evolving catalyst in a remarkably short-time. Moreover, the methodology can be easily extended to a wide range of metal particles of different nature and sizes, and also to their mixtures, finally offering a new degree of flexibility and opportunities not only in the preparation of metal-based water oxidation catalysts, but also in the preparation of inorganic metal-based catalysts for hydrogen or oxygen evolution.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000358722200048

Binary stellar evolution calculations predict that Chandrasekhar-mass carbon/oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) show a radially varying profile for the composition with a carbon depleted core. Many recent multi-dimensional simulations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), however, assume the progenitor WD has a homogeneous chemical composition.Aims. In this work, we explore the impact of different initial carbon profiles of the progenitor WD on the explosion phase and on synthetic observables in the Chandrasekhar-mass delayed detonation model. Spectra and light curves are compared to observations to judge the validity of the model.Methods. The explosion phase is simulated using the finite volume supernova code LEAFS, which is extended to treat different compositions of the progenitor WD. The synthetic observables are computed with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code ARTIS.Results. Differences in binding energies of carbon and oxygen lead to a lower nuclear energy release for carbon depleted material; thus, the burning fronts that develop are weaker and the total nuclear energy release is smaller. For otherwise identical conditions, carbon depleted models produce less Ni-56. Comparing different models with similar Ni-56 yields shows lower kinetic energies in the ejecta for carbon depleted models, but only small differences in velocity distributions and line velocities in spectra. The light curve width-luminosity relation (WLR) obtained for models with differing carbon depletion is roughly perpendicular to the observed WLR, hence the carbon mass fraction is probably only a secondary parameter in the family of SNe Ia.									21	0	0	0	0	0	21			1432-0746			WOS:000346101700075

A commercial boron-doped diamond (BDD) coated anode (active area of 10 cm(2)) was used and electrolysis was operated under batch recirculation. Under a flow rate of 3.33 mL min(-1) the flow pattern is well described by a flow model with axial dispersion in the reaction compartment. The electrosynthesis was found not to be mass transport-limited in the present system at flow rates of >= 50 mL min(-1) with a current density of <= 150 mA cm(-2). The charge transfer-controlled reaction was subsequently modeled, taking into account bubble coverage effects. Thereafter, the productivity of persulfate was investigated under different current densities, electrolyte compositions and concentrations. It was found that a high current efficiency can be obtained at the initial stage (similar to 93%, 150 mA cm(-2), <= 1 h), which deteriorated with time. By altering the volume and concentration of the anolyte, up to 1.31 M (150 mA cm(-2), 3 h) of oxidant solution can be delivered for on demand applications. The hydrogen of high purity was produced as a valuable byproduct of the process.									29	5	0	0	9	0	35			2168-0485			WOS:000373554600018

In the reductive reactor, the cathodic chamber supplied the reducing power to PCE dechlorinating biomass while a rutile electrode promoted the aerobic dechlorination of the less chlorinated PCE byproducts by oxygen in situ evolution. Two potentiostatic conditions,-350 and-550 mV vs SHE, were tested on the reductive reactor, which showed the capability to completely reduce the PCE into vinyl chloride (VC) and ethylene (Eth). These compounds were completely removed by the oxidative reactor with an average VC and Eth removal efficiency of 94 +/- 1% and 98 +/- 1%. The -350 mV vs SHE condition resulted in the higher coulombic efficiency for the reductive dechlorination which reached 22 +/- 7 % while by increasing the reductive potential to -550 mV the coulombic efficiency drop down to 6 +/- 1 % in favor of the methanogenesis reaction. Dehalococcoides mccartyi was found at high abundance in the reducing reactor while a heterogeneous bacterial consortium was observed in the oxidative reactor. Microbiome characterization of the reductive and oxidative reactors showed the concomitant presence of different redox niches in each compartment suggesting that the exchange of ionic species between the electrode and the counterelectrode allowed the co-existence of both reducing and oxidative reactions.									11	0	0	0	7	0	11			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000615246200009

Herein, by investigating the prominent temperature dependence of electrocatalytic water oxidation catalyzed by first row transition metal oxides, we present how to elevate the operating temperature of the electrolyzer as an effective and universal method to improve its electrocatalytic performance. Consequently, a triple device model combining a photothermal collector with a photovoltaic (PV) cell coupled to a water splitting device is proposed to realize the comprehensive and efficient utilization of solar energy: solar heat + PV + electrolyzer.									17	1	0	0	2	0	17			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000402870300010	28276546

The molecular structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, thermal gravimetry, IR and UV-Vis spectroscopy and its catalytic activity has been studied. X-ray structure analysis shows that each Mn(II) ion is octahedrally coordinated by two bidentate phenanthroline ligands and the carboxylate oxygen atoms from two symmetry related per-fluorosebacate ligands, which are coordinated in cisoid positions. The structure consists of polymeric chains, with the perfluorosebacato ligand bridging the Mn(II) ions in a monodentate fashion. Crystallographic characterization shows a supramolecular structure involving hydrogen bonds, pi-pi and pi-ring interactions. The catalytic results indicated that the complex has reasonably good activity towards the disproportionation. of hydrogen peroxide into water and dioxygen in methanol and it does not exhibit saturation kinetics with the substrate. The initial reaction rates and their temperature and base dependencies were investigated by monitoring the dioxygen evolution. Kinetic studies revealed a first-order dependence on the catalyst concentration. Activation parameters have been calculated at 301 K. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The structures and morphology of C/V1.11S2 nanosheets were characterized by XRD, SEM, XPS and TEM. Particularly, PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) was used as surfactant to control the morphology of vanadium sulfide and carbon source to reduce the vanadium sulfide into vanadium self-intercalated V1.11S2 phase with rich active sites. The C/V1.11S2 nanosheets showed an excellent electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction, including a low onset potential of 15 mV vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode), small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1), as well as extraordinary catalytic stability. The first-principle calculations further confirmed that the V1.11S2 has a much lower Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H)) than that of VS2. The enhanced HER performance can be contributed to the unique vanadium self-intercalated structures, nanostructured morphology and rich sulfur defects of the obtained C/V1.11S2 nanosheets. We believe that the C/V1.11S2 can be used as electrocatalyst in chemical engineering industry and our method provides guidance on the fabrication of other defective transition-metal dichalcogenides to improve their catalytic performances.

Thereafter, anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry curves and Tafel polarization curves for the composite inert anodes obtained under different PANI concentrations in the original plating bath were measured, and the microstructural features were also investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show that Al/Pb-PANI-WC composite inert anode obtained under PANI concentration of 20 g/L in the original plating bath possesses uniform microstructures and composition distributions, higher electrocatalytic activity, better reversibility of electrode reaction and corrosion resistance in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g/L Zn2+, 150 g/L H2SO4 at 35 degrees C. Compared with Pb-1%Ag alloy, the overpotential of oxygen evolutions for the composite inert anode are decreased by 185 mV and 166 mV, respectively, under 500 A/m(2) and 1000 A/m(2).									8	7	0	0	1	0	12			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000307819300024

Here, we involve titanium nitride (TiN) in a varying content (0e17.8%) to improve the efficiency of charge separation and transport, influencing the photoelectrochemical performance of LaTiO2N. The characterization results confirm the formation of a strong contact between orthorhombic-LaTiO2N and cubic-TiN particles. The photoelectrochemical (PEC) measurements reveal the inverse dependence between electron transfer phenomena and charge carrier recombination, which allows to understand the trend when modifying LaTiO2N with TiN. In fact, the incorporation of 17.8% TiN in the LaTiO2N:TiN material results in a higher photocurrent. Open-circuit potential (OCP) decay and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies confirm longer lifetimes of charge carriers for increasing amounts of TiN in the synthesized materials. Thus, the main role of TiN is to improve the properties of the semiconductor-electrolyte interface, having verified its impact on the separation and transport of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, computational studies predict that the adsorption of water molecules is favored at the LaTiO2N:TiN surface compared to the individual TiN and LaTiO2N surfaces. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, many methods use different reaction parameters, such as basic and acidic catalysts, for example oxidation, reduction, bromination, water splitting, cyanohydrin, ethoxylation, syngas, aldol condensation, Mi-chael addition, asymmetric ring opening of epoxides, epoxidation, Wittig and Heck reaction, asymmetric ester epoxidation of fatty acids, combustion of methane, NOx reduction, biodiesel synthesis, propylene oxide polymerization. Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs) have received considerable attention due their potential applications in flame retardant and has excellent medicinal property for reducing acidity. These catalysts are characterized using analytical techniques, such as: X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric-Differential Thermal Analyzer (TG-DTA), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscopes (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, N-2 Adsorption-desorption, Temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectrons spectroscopy (XPS), which gives its overall picture of its structure, porosity, morphology, thermal stability, reusability, and activity of catalysts. LDHs catalysts have proven to be economic and environmentally friendly. The above discussed applications make these catalysts unique from Green Chemistry point of view since they are reusable, and eco-friendly catalysts.

The role of the vapour phases from ferrosilicon nitride (FexSiy-Si3N4) and Al2O3 was studied by phase evolution, microstructure, and thermodynamic analyses. The results show that the formation of 15R-SiAlON is highly related to SiO(g), Si(g), Al2O(g) and Al(g) from FexSiy-Si3N4-Al2O3 composites. At 1800 degrees C in flowing nitrogen, SiO(g) and Si(g) are generated from ferrosilicon nitride. Al2O(g) and Al(g) are released from Al2O3, and their pressures depend on that of oxygen. The increase of ferrosilicon nitride promotes the generation of vapour phases. The diffusion of Al2O(g) and Al(g) into Si3N4, and of SiO(g) and Si(g) into Al2O3 particles enable the growth of 15R-SiAlON flakes based on both the Si3N4 and Al2O3 substrates by solid-gas reaction. In the presence of the Fe-Si liquid, 15R-SiAION whiskers with Fe-Si sphere on the top are generated by the liquid-solid-gas mechanism. The reactions between Al2O(g)/Al(g) and SiO(g)/Si(g) in nitrogen generate large amounts of 15R-SiAlON whiskers by the gas-gas mechanism.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000452345500152

One way to mitigate this problem is through the electrochemical reduction of nitrates under mild conditions, which is an appealing though not fully understood process. Therefore, deeper insight into the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism is needed to optimize this process. Here we thoroughly analyse the adsorption energy of nitrate with DFT calculations on various surface facets of pure Au, Ag, and their near-surface and surface alloys, as the adsorption and subsequent reduction of nitrate are thought to be rate limiting in the electrocatalytic reaction. The observed systematic trends allow prediction of the surface with highest electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of nitrate. This prediction was verified experimentally by depositing sub-monolayer amounts of Ag on polycrystalline Au electrodes. We observe a well-defined volcano curve which correlates the amount of Ag deposited on the surface with the current density at a fixed potential, with the peak activity around 2/3 ML Ag surface coverage. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the bimetallic Ag-Au systems, found through the interplay of theoretical modelling and empirical observations, serve as a clear example for the rational design of novel catalytic materials and confirm the key role that the adsorption of nitrate plays in the overall nitrate reduction rate.									60	0	0	0	7	0	59			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000314651900021	23344855

In this study, the design and sequential synthesis of a novel cobalt sulfide nanoparticle grafted Porous Organic Polymer nanohybrid (CoSx@POP) is reported and used as an active and durable water-splitting photoelectrocatalyst in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The specific textural and relevant chemical properties of as-synthesised nanohybrid materials (Co3O4@POP &CoSx@POP) were investigated by means of XRD, XPS, FTIR, C-13 CP MAS NMR, spectroscopy, HR-TEM, HAADF-STEM with the corresponding elemental mapping, FE-SEM and nitrogen physisorption studies. CoSx@POP has been evaluated as a superior photoelectrocatalyst in HER, achieving a current density of 6.43 mA cm(-2) at 0 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 0.5 m Na2SO4 electrolyte which outperforms its Co3O4@POP analogue. It was found that the nanohybrid CoSx@POP catalyst exhibited a substantially enhanced catalytic performance of 1.07 mu molmin(-1)cm(-2), which is considered to be ca. 10 and 1.94 times higher than that of pristine POP and CoSx, respectively. Remarkable photoelectrocatalytic activity of CoSx@POP compared to Co3O4@POP toward H-2 evolution could be attributed to intrinsic synergistic effect of CoSx and POP, leading to the formation of a unique CoSx@POP nanoarchitecture with high porosity, which permits easy diffusion of electrolyte and efficient electron transfer from POP to CoSx during hydrogen generation with a tunable bandgap, that straddles between the reduction and oxidation potential of water.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000413337400020	28837241

However, the high impedance across the bandgap and the low concentration of intrinsic charge carriers have limited their energy conversion. By contrast, metallic nanoparticles possess a sea of free electrons that can effectively promote the transition to the excited state for reactions. Here, an atomic layer of a bimetallic concoction of silver-gold shells is precisely fabricated onto an Au core via a sonochemical dispersion approach to form a core-shell of Au-Ag that exploits the wide availability of excited states of Ag while maintaining an efficient localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au. Catalytic results demonstrate that this mix of Ag and Au can convert solar energy to hydrogen at high efficiency with an increase of 112.5% at an optimized potential of -0.5 V when compared to light-off conditions under the electrochemical LSPR. This outperforms the commercial Pt catalysts by 62.1% with a hydrogen production rate of 1870 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) at room temperature.

Here, it has been found anionic vacancies in NiCo(2)A(4) (A = O, S, Se) can weaken the shackles of surrounding water in H13O6+, resulting into efficient capture of H+ to form a H+-enriched field. Taking selenium vacancy-rich NiCo2Se4 nanowires on nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers as an example, it displays higher electrocatalytic activities with low overpotential of 168 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec(-1). The HER performance is strongly related to the anionic vacancy size, the larger the anionic vacancy size is (V-Se > V-S > V-O), the higher the HER activity does. Guided by density functional theory calculations, it is found that the point defect structures can not only strengthen its interfacial linkage force with H+ by weakening the hydration force of contiguous hydronium ion, but also increase its charge density for efficient electron transfer to adsorbed H+. Therefore, this work creates a useful strategy to optimize the HER performance of traditional bimetallic compounds by engineering the solid-liquid-gas three-phase interfacial interaction.

However, the rational design on an industrial scale is a formidable challenge. Herein, we reported a facile calcination at controlled temperatures to fabricate rationally assembled cobalt nanoparticles embedded in defect-rich N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co-NCNTs), which was derived from low-cost dicyanadiamide thermally polymerized with cobalt precursor forming metalorganic frameworks, then further calculation leading to final products. The as-obtained samples were endowed with high content of N as electrocatalytic active site, defect-rich structure and excellent synergistic effect between cobalt nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes toward electrocatalytic HER. As expected, Co-NCNTs were highly active and long-term stable with onset potentials of c.a. 15 mV in acidic electrolytes (0.5 MH2SO4), 70 mV in alkaline (1 M KOH) and 300 mV in neutral media (pH 7). Specially, to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential of 103 mV in acid, 204 mV in alkaline and 337 mV in neutral media was obtained. The enhanced HER performance was discussed in detail by adjusting the molar ratio of precursor and metal species. Moreover, the present synthetic route is easy to scale up and expand to other non-noble metal and alloy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By using first-principles calculation, we systematically investigated the NRR catalytic activity of the transition metal (TM, including Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) monomer-, dimer-, and trimer-anchored graphdiyne (GDY) monolayers. It is shown that most of the TM monomer- and dimer-anchored GDY monolayers have enhanced NRR catalytic activity compared with the Ru(0001) stepped surface. Especially, the Co dimer-anchored GDY monolayer (Co-2@GDY) exhibits the best NRR catalytic activity with the onset potential of -0.43 V and a high ability to suppress the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. The high NRR catalytic activity of Co-2@GDY could be attributed to the localized electronic states near the Fermi level and the strong electron-donating ability of the GDY monolayer. Furthermore, an approximate linear trend between the predicted onset potential and the N adsorption energy is revealed, which may act as a simple descriptor for the intrinsic NRR catalytic activity of such catalysts. Our findings not only propose an efficient and low-cost double-atom catalyst for NRR but also provide a new clue for designing TM atomic catalysts based on GDY sheets for various electrocatalysis applications.									151	11	0	0	2	0	150			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000480502300032

Although heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts have been extensively studied and have emerged superior for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, leaching of cobalt is still a major concern. Herein, we report a photo-assisted PMS activation approach using cobalt doped mesoporous iron oxide with exceptional activity and stability up to 7 cycles with very low cobalt leaching (0.5 ppm). The highest activity was obtained by 1 mol % cobalt doped mesoporous iron oxide. Orange II dye was completely degraded by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated under visible light irradiation within 1 min. ROS were evaluated using two distinct techniques (Fluorescence probes and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). ROS quenching experiments were also used to highlight the dominant pathway. This study correlates the structural and electronic changes induced with cobalt doping to the exceptional activity.									38	2	0	0	20	0	40			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000510526000050

In the absence of peripheral functionalization with specific linkers, the porphyrin adsorption is driven by the coordination of the two pyrrolic nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle to two consecutive oxygen atoms of the protruding O-br rows via hydrogen bonding. This chemical interaction favours the iminic nitrogen uptake of hydrogen from near surface layers at room temperature, thus yielding a stable acidic porphyrin (4H-P). In addition, a mild annealing (similar to 100 degrees C) triggers the incorporation of a Ti atom in the porphyrin macrocycle (self-metalation). We recently demonstrated that such a low temperature reaction is driven by a Lewis base iminic attack, which lowers the energy barriers for the outdiffusion of Ti interstitial atoms (Ti-int) [Kremer et al., Appl. Surf. Sci., 2021, 564, 150403]. In the monolayer (ML) range, the porphyrin adsorption site, corresponding to a TiO-TPP configuration, is extremely stable and tetraphenyl-porphyrins (TPPs) may even undergo conformational distortion (flattening) by partial cyclo-dehydrogenation, while remaining anchored to the O rows up to 450 degrees C [Lovat et al., Nanoscale, 2017, 9, 11694]. Here we show that, upon self-metalation, isolated molecules at low coverage may jump atop the rows of five-fold coordinated Ti atoms (Ti-5f). This configuration is associated with the formation of a new coordination complex, Ti-O-Ti-5f, as determined by comparison with the deposition of pristine titanyl-porphyrin (TiO-TPP) molecules. The newly established Ti-O-Ti-5f anchoring configuration is found to be stable also beyond the TPP flattening reaction. The anchoring of TiO-TPP to the Ti-5f rows is, however, susceptible to the cross-talk between phenyls of adjacent molecules, which ultimately drives the TiO-TPP temperature evolution in the ML range along the same pathway followed by 2H-TPP.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000797103300001	35583960

The catalytic performances of SACs are mainly determined by the surrounding microenvironment of single metal sites. Microenvironment engineering of SACs and understanding of the structure-activity relationship is critical, which remains challenging. Herein, a self-sacrificing strategy is developed to synthesize asymmetric N,S-coordinated single-atom Fe with axial fifth hydroxy (OH) coordination (Fe-N3S1OH) embedded in N,S codoped porous carbon nanospheres (Fe-N/S-C). Such unique penta-coordination microenvironment is determined by cutting-edge techonologies aiding of systematic simulations. The as-obtained Fe-N/S-C exhibits superior catalytic ORR activity, and showcases a half-wave potential of 0.882 V surpassing the benchmark Pt/C. Moreover, theoretical calculations confirmed the axial OH in Fe-N3S1OH can optimize 3d orbitals of Fe center to strengthen O-2 adsorption and enhance O-2 activation on Fe site, thus reducing the ORR barrier and accelerating ORR dynamics. Furthermore, Fe-N/S-C containing H-2-O-2 fuel cell performs a high peak power density of 512 mW cm(-2), and Fe-N/S-C based Zn-air batteries show the peak power density of 203 and 49 mW cm(-2) in liquid and flexible all-solid-state configurations, respectively. This study offers a new platform for fundamentally understand the axial fifth coordination in asymmetrical planar single-atom metal sites for electrocatalysis.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000720628200001	34799983

The Enzymes				47				167	192		10.1016/bs.enz.2020.05.005				2020	2020	Aryl-alcohol oxidases (AAO) constitute a family of FAD-containing enzymes, included in the glucose-methanol-choline oxidase/dehydrogenase superfamily of proteins. They are commonly found in fungi, where their eco-physiological role is to produce hydrogen peroxide that activates ligninolytic peroxidases in white-rot (lignin-degrading) basidiomycetes or to trigger the Fenton reactions in brown-rot (carbohydrate-degrading) basidiomycetes. These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of a plethora of aromatic, and some aliphatic, polyunsaturated alcohols bearing conjugated primary hydroxyl group. Besides, the enzymes show activity on the hydrated forms of the corresponding aldehydes. Some AAO features, such as the broad range of substrates that it can oxidize (with the only need of molecular oxygen as co-substrate) and its stereoselective mechanism, confer good properties to these enzymes as industrial biocatalysts. In fact, AAO can be used for different biotechnological applications, such as flavor synthesis, secondary alcohol deracemization and oxidation of furfurals for the production of furandicarboxylic acid as a chemical building block. Also, AAO can participate in processes of interest in the wood biorefinery and textile industries as an auxiliary enzyme providing hydrogen peroxide to ligninolytic or dye-decolorizing peroxidases. Both rational design and directed molecular evolution have been employed to engineer AAO for some of the above biotechnological applications.									7	1	0	0	6	0	7			0423-2607			MEDLINE:32951823	32951823

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electrochemical methods such as linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the surface morphology, crystal structure and electrochemical performance of the electrodes. Acid dye AR 73 was selected as target pollutants to investigate the electro-catalyst behavior, and UV/vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the concentration changes with time. The results indicated that the presence of Cu nanorods on the Ti substrate promoted the electrodes' property obviously. Ti/Cu-NRs/SnO2-Sb anode possessed smaller charge transfer resistance and longer service life than Ti/SnO2-Sb anode. The oxygen evolution potential (OEP) of Ti/Cu-NRs/SnO2-Sb electrodes reach 2.17 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). Removal of pollutants and reaction rate were all promoted due to the introduction of Cu nanorods in the process of AR 73 decomposing with Ti/Cu-NRs/SnO2-Sb electrodes. And specific energy consumption also reduced remarkably. Our study has shown that the fabricated Ti/Cu-NRs/SnO2-Sb electrodes are very promising for the electrochemical treatment of wastewater.

Herein, we report a successful case with pre-existing Pt nanoparticles targeting a highly active catalyst for the electrocatalytic formic acid oxidation reaction (FAOR), the key anode reaction for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs), by adsorbing a small-molecule inorganic ligand of sulfite (SO32-) on the metal catalysts. The adsorption of sulfite affords isolated Pt sites that can effectively suppress the dehydration pathway of the FAOR and thereby minimize the evolution of poisonous CO as an intermediate. It further allows the convenient oxidation of CO possibly producedviathe dehydration pathway at a much lower potential. Due to the concerted effects, the sulfite-modified commercial Pt/C showed a 13.4-fold increase in the specific activity and a 6.3-fold increase in the mass activity in the electrocatalytic FAOR, compared with the pristine catalyst. This strategy is easy to operate and scale up, free of toxic or organic compounds (thus environmentally friendly), and directly applicable to already existing commercial catalysts, which opens an attractive route to the tailoring of catalytic properties of noble metal catalysts for DFAFCs and many other applications.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000563999100027

The annual worldwide ammonia production is currently more than 200 million tons through the Haber-Bosch process, which consumes an enormous amount of energy due to the requirement of high pressure (>10 MPa) and relatively high temperature (400-500 degrees C). In recent years, electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction (ENRR) under ambient conditions has received paramount attention in the scientific community. However, large-scale production of ammonia from the ENRR is limited by the lack of efficient cost-effective catalysts. The success of ENRR firmly depends on the efficiency of the electrocatalyst in a suitable electrolyte. However, identification and generation of the active sites in the electrocatalysts for ENRR remain elusive, impeding the development of the catalysts. In this review article, recent progress made in the development of efficient electrocatalysts for ENRR under ambient conditions is focused on with special attention on the physicochemical properties and active sites of the catalyst towards the NH3 production rate by considering experimental as well as theoretical aspects. This review elaborates on key aspects for the development of an efficient and stable electrocatalyst for NH3 production. In addition, the role of electrolytes and different sources of errors in the ENRR measurement for NH3 production are outlined briefly.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2633-5409		WOS:000731724400001

The photo/electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions has attracted increasing interests recently, providing alternative routes to realize green NH3 synthesis. Despite rapid advances achieved in this most attractive research field, the unsatisfactory conversion efficiency including a low NH3 yield rate, and limited Faradaic efficiency or apparent quantum efficiency still remains as a great challenge. The NRR performance is intrinsically related to the electronic and surface structure of catalysts. Rational design and preparation of advanced catalysts are indispensable to improve the performance (e.g., activity and selectivity) of NRR. In this Review, various strategies for the development of desirable catalysts are comprehensively summarized, mainly containing the defect engineering, structural manipulation, crystallographic tailoring, and interface regulation. State-of-the-art heterogeneous NRR catalysts, prevailing theories and underlying catalytic mechanisms, together with current issues, critical challenges, and perspectives are discussed. It is highly expected that this Review will promote the understanding of recent advances in this area and stimulate greater interests for designing promising NRR catalysts in future.									136	12	0	0	8	0	135			2155-5435			WOS:000543663800032

Materials (Basel, Switzerland)				12	2						10.3390/ma12020199				2019 Jan 09	2019	Developing energetic composite materials consisting of fuel and oxidizer is an effective strategy to enhance the energy release property. However, this strategy has rarely been applied in Potassium Perchlorate (KClO₄)-containing energetic materials, even though KClO₄ is a much stronger oxidizer than most previously reported metal-oxide oxidizer. One of the main obstacles is the lack of simple and in situ ways to introduce KClO₄ into the composite. In present work, micrometer KClO₄/Zirconium (KClO₄/Zr) composite particles were successfully prepared using a facile chemical solution-deposition method. The structure and particle morphologies of as-obtained KClO₄/Zr composite were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM)-EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectrometer). The evolutionary combustion behavior was evaluated using flame-based light-radiation spectra and successive photography technique. Results showed that the morphology, light-radiation properties and flame-evolution characteristics of KClO₄/Zr composite varied with the content of KClO₄ and the particle size of Zr. Compared with the mechanical mixture of KClO₄/Zr, the KClO₄/Zr composite showed much higher light-radiation intensity and longer light-emission duration time after reasonably controlling the preparation parameters. Flame photographs revealed that the enhanced light radiation of KClO₄/Zr composite should be ascribed to higher use efficiency of "oxygen" in the oxidizer, which promoted both the solid⁻solid and solid⁻gas reaction pathways between KClO₄ and Zr.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1944			MEDLINE:30634412	30634412

A major shortcoming of the current CFD tools to study biomass gasification is the lack of computationally affordable chemical kinetic models, which allows detailed predictions of the yield and composition of various gas and tar species in complex reactor configurations. In this work, a detailed mechanism is assembled from the literature and reduced to a compact model describing the gas-phase reactions of biomass gasification in the absence of oxygen. The reduction procedure uses a graph based method for unimportant kinetic pathways elimination and quasi-steady-state species selection. The resulting reduced model contains 39 gas species and 118 reactions and is validated against the detailed model and two experimental configurations: the pyrolysis of volatile species, such as levoglucosan, in a tubular reactor, and the fast pyrolysis of biomass particles in a drop tube reactor. The reduced model predicts the evolution of major gas products (e.g., CO, CO2, CH4, H-2) and various classes of tar (e.g., single-ring aromatics, oxygenated aromatics, PAHs) produced during biomass gasification. The capability of the reduced model to adequately capture the chemical process in a complex reactor geometry at an acceptable computational cost is demonstrated by employing it in a simulation of a pseudo two-dimensional laboratory-scale fluidized bed reactor.									15	1	0	0	4	0	15			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000416204800061

To achieve better electrochemical and catalytic activity of hybrid Zn batteries, designing multifunctional electrode materials that possess simultaneously high electrical conductivity, fast mass transfer kinetics, and sufficient active sites is essential. Herein, porous NiCoSe2@NiOOH/CoOOH (NCS@NCH) heterostructures, derived from NiCoSe2 (NCS) nanosheets by an in-situ electrochemical phase transformation process, are firstly utilized as multifunctional electrode material for flexible hybrid Zn batteries. During the phase transformation process, the porous nanosheet structure of the highly conductive NCS scaffold can be well maintained and plenty of electroactive sites are formed uniformly, which are beneficial to both faradaic and oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER). Together with sodium polyacrylate (PANa) hydrogel electrolyte, the flexible hybrid battery delivers ultrahigh energy density (944.8 Wh/Kg) and superior cycling life both in a tightly sealed state (capacity retention:105.1% after 4000 cycles) and open-air environment (100 h at 4 mA/cm(2)), indicating its favorable durability and environmental adaptation. This work may bring the flexible hybrid Zn batteries one step forward toward practical applications and stimulate the pullulation of hybrid energy storage and conversion devices by the introduction of multifunctional electrode materials.									36	2	0	0	0	0	36			2405-8297			WOS:000701681200003

Herein, we report a non-loading electrocatalysis system, where the electrocatalysts are dispersed in aqueous solution rather than loading them on electrode substrates. The system consists of aqueous Ag nanodots (AgNDs) as the catalyst and metallic titanium (Ti) mesh as the current collector for electrocatalytic NRR. The as-synthesized AgNDs, homogeneously dispersed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution (pH = 10.5), can achieve an NH3 yield rate of 600.4 +/- 23.0 mu g h(-1) mg(Ag)(-1) with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 10.1 +/- 0.7% at -0.25 V (vs. RHE). The FE can be further improved to be 20.1 +/- 0.9% at the same potential by using Ti mesh modified with oxygen vacancy-rich TiO2 nanosheets as the current collector. Utilizing the aqueous AgNDs catalyst, a Ti plate based two-electrode configured flow-type electrochemical reactor was developed to achieve an NH3 yield rate of 804.5 +/- 30.6 mu g h(-1) mg(Ag)(-1) with a FE of 8.2 +/- 0.5% at a voltage of -1.8 V. The designed non-loading electrocatalysis system takes full advantage of the AgNDs' active sites for N-2 adsorption and activation, following an alternative hydrogenation mechanism revealed by theoretical calculations.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2399-3669			WOS:000613476600001

Various precious metals and their corresponding oxides have been proposed as electrocatalysts to reduce the charge voltage of Li-O-2 batteries. However, the real mechanism by which these solid catalysts decompose Li2O2 during the charge process is still under debate. Here, Ru nanoparticles supported on carbon matrixes with ultrahigh dispersibility were synthesized and evaluated as cathode materials for Li-O-2 batteries. The charge voltage of the corresponding Li-O-2 battery was reduced to below 4.1 V (V vs. Li/Li+), and a stable cycling performance over more than 100 cycles was achieved. Nevertheless, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements revealed that large amounts of gaseous by-products evolved even during the first charge process, suggesting that severe parasitic reactions accompanied the decomposition of Li2O2. The undesired degradation of the carbon cathode and/or electrolyte was also accelerated in the presence of Ru. Thus, this study has revealed that previous conclusions regarding the role of Ru in catalytically decomposing Li2O2 may be misleading. Furthermore, the necessity of performing quantitative analysis of gas evolution in order to study the real performance of Li-O-2 batteries has been demonstrated. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we firstly developed three-dimensional alpha-nickel hydroxide as an advantageous electrocatalyst for OER by a simple solvothermal method. By controlling the solvent, two kinds of regular and one kind of irregular pure alpha-nickel hydroxide were successfully synthesized. Two regular catalysts' catalytic activity can be enhanced by the level of regularity increasing. Interestingly, with the increase of irregularity, compared with nanosphere-like Ni(OH)(2), nanoparticle-sphere-like Ni(OH)(2) sample's specific surface areas, the number of ion transport channels, and reaction kinetics performance also raise, which actually enhances catalytic activity. In a word, the most irregular Ni(OH)(2)-NPS has the best electrocatalytic activity (eta = 250 mV) and the lowest Tafel slope (73.9 mV dec(-1)), and the outstanding constancy (8 h) at 1.48 V (vs. RHE) could be achieved, meanwhile, the benchmark RuO2 (340 mV and 87.4 mV dec(-1)) is also inferior to Ni(OH)(2)-NPS. By comparing three Ni(OH)(2) samples, this work provides a new single transition metal system for about 3D materials and facilitates the development of highly efficient water oxidation catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000836517800001

Here we present realistic zinc-air pouch cells designed by the (101)-facet copper phosphosulfide [CPS(101)] as a cathode as well as anti-freezing chitosan-biocellulosics as super-ionic conductor electrolytes. The proposed CPS(101) exhibits trifunctional activity and stability (>30,000 cycles) towards reversible oxygen reactions and hydrogen evolution reactions, outperforming commercial Pt/C and RuO2. Furthermore, hydroxide super-ion conductors utilizing polymerized chitosan-biocellulosics reveal exceptional conductivity (86.7 mS cm(-1) at 25 degrees C) with high mechanical/chemical robustness. High cell-level energy densities of 460 Wh kg(cell)(-1)/1,389 Wh l(-1) are normally measured in pouch cells (1 Ah) with a cycle lifespan of 6,000/1,100 cycles at 25 mA cm(-2) for 20/70% depths of discharge, and the highest densities we could achieve were 523 Wh kg(cell)(-1)/1,609 Wh l(-1). Flexible pouch cells operate well at rates of 5-200 mA cm(-2) over a broad temperature range of -20 to 80 degrees C.Zinc-air batteries are viewed as a sustainable storage technology, but their commercialization requires a genuine performance leap forwards from the laboratory scale. Here the authors report a cell-level design and demonstrate an ampere-hour pouch cell with exceptionally high energy density and cycle lifespan.									54	0	0	0	4	0	54			2058-7546			WOS:000639627500002

However, today's development of NO3- electroreduction remains hindered by the lack of a mechanistic picture of how catalyst structure may be tuned to enhance catalytic activity. Here we demonstrate enhanced NO3- reduction reaction (NO3-RR) performance on Cu50Ni50 alloy catalysts, including a 0.12 V upshift in the half-wave potential and a 6-fold increase in activity compared to those obtained with pure Cu at 0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Ni alloying enables tuning of the Cu d-band center and modulates the adsorption energies of intermediates such as *NO3-, *NO2, and *NH2. Using density functional theory calculations, we identify a NO3-RR-to-NH3 pathway and offer an adsorption energy-activity relationship for the CuNi alloy system. This correlation between catalyst electronic structure and NO3-RR activity offers a design platform for further development of NO3-RR catalysts.									226	5	0	0	34	0	227			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000526393100032	32118414

Nevertheless, in co-pyrolysis, except the interaction between the volatiles, the volatiles could also interact with the char of same or different origin. Thus, understanding the specific effects of the volatiles of plastics/biomass on the evolution of the char from biomass/plastics is difficult. Hence, the investigation of the sequential pyrolysis of cellulose and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 600 & nbsp;C was to explore the specific influences of volatiles from cellulose/PET in upper bed on the property of the char from PET/cellulose in lower bed. During sequential pyrolysis with cellulose in upper bed, the cellulose derived oxygen-rich radicals promoted the cracking of the organic component on the PET-derived char, which significantly reduced the char yield while promoted the formation of heavy organics products and reduced hydrophobicity of the PET-derived char. Additionally, the cellulose-derived volatiles (e.g. ketones and aldehydes) involved in the secondary polymerization reactions with the volatiles from PET, forming more phenolics. PET-derived hydrocarbon-rich molecules did not promote charring reactions of the cellulose-derived char but increased hydrophobicity of the cellulose-char. Moreover, the varied interaction of the volatiles also significantly impacted thermal stability of the functional groups of char. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium, designing precatalysts that could provide abundant catalytic active centers can significantly improve the electrocatalytic activity. This work demonstrates the production of active alpha-Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH species using the sacrificial pre-catalyst Zn-x/Co3-x (PO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O (ZCP) (x = 0.15-0.9), which was developed by the one-step hydrothermal method. Electrochemical activation of ZCP results in the formation of a porous cobalt catalyst with abundant active centers. Elemental analysis revealed that both Zn2+ and PO43- ions etch away during the activation process, thereby exposing a higher number of catalytically active cobalt centers that otherwise stay inactive due to their location in the bulk. The resulting materials showed promising electrocatalytic activities toward OER; especially, a material (ZCP-0.3) consisting of Zn2+ and Co2+ in a 1:7 ratio was found to deliver the best activity. The carbon paper-supported ZCP-0.3 exhibited a high current density of 50 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 390 mV. In contrast, the material prepared without zinc (i.e., Co-3(OH)(2)(HPO4)(2)) showed inferior catalytic activity, thus demonstrating the necessity for Zn2+ etching to expose the additional active sites for improved electrocatalytic activity of ZCP0.3.Y									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200064

This has resulted in a progress in both fundamental understanding of the complex electrocatalytic systems and in the development of efficient synthetic schemes to tailor the surface precisely at the atomic level. One of the viable concepts in electrocatalysis is to optimise the activity through the direct engineering of the properties of the topmost layers of the surface, where the reactions take place, with monolayer and sub-monolayer amounts of metals. This forms (bi)metallic systems where the electronic structure of the active sites is optimised using the interplay between the nature and position of the atoms of solute metals at the surface. In this review, we focus on recent theoretical and experimental achievements in designing efficient (bi)metallic electrocatalysts with selective positioning of foreign atoms to form a variety of active catalytic sites at the electrode surface. We summarize recent results published in the literature and outline challenges for computational and experimental electrocatalysis to engineer active and selective catalysts using atomic layers.									163	7	0	0	10	0	166			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000319527400025	23549635

However, in many cases, molecular catalysts undergo structural changes to some other form(s), which are finally the real catalysts. Here, we report two half-sandwich ruthenium complexes; [Ru([9]aneN3Xbpy)Cl](+) 3 and [Ru([9]aneN3)(pic)OH2](2+) 4, based on the macrocyclic 1,4,7-triazacyclononane ([9]aneN3) ligand for water oxidation (WO). The two complexes have similar core but different ancillary ligands, which greatly affected their stability as well as activity for WO. Complex 3 retained high stability and excellent activity (turnover number [TON] 1250) in chemical WO and first-order reaction kinetics with respect to [Ce-IV] with a calculated rate constant (k(cat)) of 34.59 s(-1). Further, the complex demonstrated very low overpotential of similar to 210 mV in electrochemical WO. At an overpotential of only 400 mV, turnover frequency (TOF) of complex 3 was electrochemically estimated to be 131.2 s(-1). In contrast, complex 4 underwent picolinate ligand dissociation, as a deactivation pathway, to form the tri-aqua derivative. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to explain the dissociation mechanism of picolinate ligand in complex 4, which happens through a stepwise dissociation mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-2605	1099-0739		WOS:000728560100001

Raw coal and inhibitor solution (10 wt%) were mixed at weight ratio 4:1. Coal (raw coal, inhibited coals) oxidation reaction was measured by own designed temperature-programming device. Simultaneous TG-DSC was carried out. Evolution of CO with increasing temperature and cross point temperature (CPT) were obtained of coal oxidation reaction; these results showed that the addition of (NaPO3)(6) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) to raw coal had an obvious suppression effect during low-temperature oxidation. CPT of APP-inhibited coal was 16 degrees C higher than that of raw coal. TG-DTG curve results revealed that characteristic temperatures and mass fraction (omega) of APP-inhibited coal were significantly higher than other coal samples. Initial exothermal temperatures, thermal peak temperatures, and inhibition ratio were obtained from DSC curves. The results all demonstrated that APP had obvious inhibition effects on the whole coal oxidation. Infrared spectrograms of release gases showed that temperatures of the maximum release value and the whole quantity of gas products (CO2, CH4, CO, and H2O) were decreased due to the addition of APP by eliminating free radicals and diluting the amount of oxygen in the surrounding coal sample.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1939-2699	1939-2702		WOS:000663188300001

The runs were conducted in a two-step system provided with a thermal step (at 500 degrees C) for bio-oil vaporization and pyrolytic lignin retention, followed by an online catalytic reforming step in a fluidized bed reactor. The spent catalyst was characterized by temperature-programmed oxidation, temperature-programmed reduction, and transmission electron microscopy in order to ascertain the causes of deactivation and the effect of the reaction conditions on these causes. The evolution with time on stream of both bio-oil oxygenates conversion and yields of reaction products shows different periods and catalyst states, with two sharp changes associated with different catalyst deactivation causes: (i) change in the states of Rh species and aging of the support (with fast dynamics) and (ii) coke deposition (at low temperature) or Rh sintering (at high temperature, with slow dynamics).									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000428003800095

The as-prepared powders were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet- visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XRD and XPS results showed that nitrogen and carbon in the TiCN lattice could be replaced by oxygen through calcining the TiCN powder in air. Stronger light absorption in both the UV and visible light region was observed for the as-prepared powders compared to commercial P25 from the DRS results. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance over both the as-prepared catalysts and P25 was tested using Na2S-Na2SO3 as a sacrificial electron donor under UV and UV-Vis light irradiation. The highest photocatalytic activity was observed for CN-TiO2 obtained from TiCN and calcined at 550 degrees C. The hydrogen evolution rate reached 41.1 mu mol.h(-1), which is higher than that from P25 (26.2 mu mol.h(-1)). This may be caused by a synergistic effect between doped C and N elements. Under UV-Vis light illumination, the highest hydrogen evolution rate was 0.2 mu mol.h(-1), which may be due to a minor contribution of visible light absorption to water photo-splitting for hydrogen production.									20	23	0	0	2	0	35			1000-6818			WOS:000269961300020

In this perspective, we advocate that standardizing these practices can aid in advancing research efforts toward the development of efficient and selective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Using information taken from experimental studies, we identify variables that influence the measured activity of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts and propose procedures to account for these variables in order to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of reported data. We recommend that catalysts be measured under conditions which do not introduce artifacts from impurities, from either the electrolyte or counter electrode, and advocate the acquisition of data measured in the absence of mass transport effects. Furthermore, measured rates of electrochemical reactions should be normalized to both the geometric electrode area as well as the electrochemically active surface area to facilitate the comparison of reported catalysts with those previously known. We demonstrate that, when these factors are accounted for, the CO2 reduction activities of Ag and Cu measured in different laboratories exhibit little difference. Adoption of the recommendations presented in this perspective would greatly facilitate the identification of superior catalysts for CO2 reduction arising solely from changes in their composition and pretreatment.									166	5	0	0	15	0	166			2155-5435			WOS:000438475100092

The structure and morphology of the prepared HES-p(AMPS) IPN hydrogel and Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN catalyst were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN was used as catalyst for hydrogen production from the hydrolysis of ethylenediamine bisborane (EDAB). The activation parameters for the hydrolysis reaction of EDAB catalyzed by Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN were calculated as E-a = 38.92 kJ mo1(-1) , Delta H-# = 36.28 kJ mol(-1) , and Delta S-# = -111.85 J mol(-1) K-1 , respectively. The TOF for the Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN catalyst was 2.253 mol H-2 (mol Ru(0) min)(-1 ). It was determined that Ru@HES-p(AMPS) IPN, a reusable Hydrolysis catalyst, still had 81.5% catalytic activity after the 5th use. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The FeOOH@Pt catalyst exhibited ca. 2.5 and 1.94-times increases in the catalytic activity and poisoning tolerance, respectively, of the formic acid electro-oxidation (FAO) - the anodic reaction in the direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Surprisingly, with a post-activation of the FeOOH@Pt catalyst at 0.48 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.2 mol L-1 NaOH, a favorable Fe2+/Fe3+ transformation succeeded to eliminate the permanent CO poisoning of Pt that impaired the catalytic performance of DFAFCs. This was synchronized (relatively to nano-Pt) with a four-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency, ca. -174 mV shift in the onset potential, and eightfold enhancement in the catalyst's durability for FAO. The activated FeOOH@Pt catalyst also showed a mass activity of 296 mA mg(Pt)(-1) (at 0.8 V), which was ca. nine times higher than that (34 mA mg(Pt)(-1)) of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. The ascertained improvement in the electron transfer at the FeOOH@Pt surface foresees quick industrialization for DFAFCs. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate a simple cost-effective spray-coating strategy to develop ultrathin and highly crystalline CoOx nanoparticulate thin-films as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. During electrocatalysis, nanoscale surface-coated CoOx (SC-CoOx NPs) exhibits high activity while initiating OER and HER just at 1.48 V-RHE and 0.22 V-RHE, respectively, and displayed current decades for OER and HER at an overpotential of 300 mV and 350 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the high electrochemically active surface area of 301 cm(2), facile electrode kinetics and low charge transfer resistance at electrode-electrolyte interphase are observed that promote efficient electron transfer and facilitate adsorption/ desorption of various intermediates during water splitting process thus making it energy efficient. DFT calclations also suggest that the electrode is very feasible for water oxidation catalysis which is ruling reaction under employed conditions. The electrocatalyst also presented superior long-term durabilities during extended period water electrolysis experiments. The present material, method and approach of growing metal-oxide nanoscale and thin-film assemblage of catalytic materials can offer an exciting and straightforward approach for producing highly applied catalytic materials.

Beyond solution-phase assembly of graphene sheets, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) has been recently introduced as a scalable, high-yield, and facile strategy for preparing 3D graphene materials with relatively high crystallinity and controllable layer numbers. Such 3D graphene structures have served as ideal platforms for constructing next-generation energy storage and conversion devices such as supercapacitors, batteries, and fuel cells. In this tutorial review, we focus on recent progress in the scalable CVD growth of 3D graphene materials (e.g., foams, shells, and hierarchical structures) as well as their applications in energy-related fields. First, we emphasize the role of substrate shape and composition (metal or non-metal) in the CVD growth of diverse 3D graphene materials. The related growth mechanisms of these 3D graphene materials are also analysed and discussed. Second, we demonstrate the applications of the CVD-derived 3D graphene materials in various energy-related devices. Finally, we conclude this review with our insights into the challenges and future opportunities for CVD synthesis as well as the application of such intriguing 3D graphene materials.									104	10	0	0	2	0	106			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000431739100002	29484331

The heterostructures discrepancy in WC|N catalysts involving constitutions of crystal phases and concentration of carbon and nitrogen could be effectively adjusted by simply changing carbonization time, and then had a great impact on the electrocatalytic behaviors of WC|N. Porous morphology of WC|N catalysts was also inherited from tungsten nitrides to provide the large surface area. The ternary Pt/WC|N catalysts were fabricated by an ethylene glycol reduction method with microwave-assisted heating. The intimate contact and intensive interaction between Pt and WC|N catalyst were verified. Impressively, the Pt/WC|N hybrid exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity for methanol oxidation and improved CO anti-poisoning capacity which higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. The catalytic activity was enhanced due to the large amount of distortion which was induced during the diffusion of C into WN lattice and resultant phase transformation. Samples which were carbonized for 120 min displayed the outstanding catalytic activity among all the materials even from the different tungsten sources suggest that the extent of distortion in catalyst is the crucial factor for the catalyst activity in electrochemistry reaction.

The desired monometallic MOF-74 (Ni-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74) and bimetallic NiCo-MOF-74 were synthesized by students using cheap raw materials under mild reaction conditions. Students operated the modern instruments to perform powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) applied extensively in chemical research to explore whether the materials were successfully synthesized and the thermal stability under the guidance of the instructor. The electrocatalytic OER activity of bimetallic NiCo-MOF-74 was compared with monometallic Ni-MOF-74 and Co-MOF-74 to explore and understand the bimetallic synergy effect in MOFs materials. This experiment not only enabled students to master the solvothermal method for MOFs synthesis but also provided students the chance to operate several common chemical instruments and master their functions, realizing the application of theoretical knowledge to practice. Most importantly, this experiment helped students realize the importance of MOFs in the electrochemical energy fields and established a sense of teamwork by analyzing and discussing the bimetallic synergy effect in NiCo-MOF-74 for OER catalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000708679700034

The Cu electrocatalyst was electrodeposited onto gas diffusion layers (GDLs) and was directly bonded to AEM by mechanical pressing in the hybrid device. The impacts of relative humidity at the cathode inlet on the selectivity and activity of COR were investigated by computational modeling and experimental methods. At a relative humidity of 30%, the Cu-based catalyst in the hybrid device exhibited a total operating current density of 87 mA cm(-2) with a -2.0 V vs Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C2H4 generation of 32.6%, and an FE for a liquid-based carbon product of 42.6%. Significant improvements in the partial current densities for COR were observed in relation to planar electrodes or flooded gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). In addition, a custom test bed was constructed to characterize the oxidation states of the Cu catalysts in real time along with product analysis though the backside of the GDLs via operando X-ray absorption (XAS) measurements.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200005

In these systems, manganese complexes and tyrosine are electron donors, modelling the manganese cluster and tyrosine(Z) in PSII. The donors have been covalently linked to a photosensitizer, a ruthenium(ii) tris-bipyridyl complex, that plays the role of the P-680 chlorophylls in PSII. It has been demonstrated that, in the presence of an external electron acceptor in solution, the model systems can undergo an intermolecular electron transfer from the photoexcited state of Ru-II to an acceptor, followed by an intramolecular electron transfer from the coordinated Mn complexes or the tyrosine unit to the photogenerated Ru-III. This leads to regeneration of the Ru-II and oxidation of the Mn complexes or generation of a tyrosine radical. The process closely mimics the primary reaction steps on the donor side of PSII.									516	11	0	0	40	0	522			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000166454500005

Meanwhile,at the CO initial pressure of 4.5MPa,the bridge-bonds of methylene and oxygen and the methyl side chains in the lignite can be broken,leading to the generation of a large number of free radicals.It improves the activity of the aromatic lamellar to rearrange and generate polyaromatic free radicals that can be stabilized by H·to form plastic species such as preasphaltene.To this end,the caking property of the lignite is improved.			在亚临界H_2O-CO体系中开展了褐煤改性增黏研究,利用气相色谱(GC)、傅立叶变换红外光谱(FTIR)、~(13)C核磁共振(~(13)C-NMR)、热重分析(TG)和电子自旋共振(ESR)等方法,探索了CO对煤黏结性、结构特征和自由基变迁规律的影响,进而认识了CO对煤改性增黏的作用机制。结果表明:在CO初压为4.5MPa时对褐煤进行改性,褐煤的黏结指数(GRI)可由0显著提高至91.35。CO通过水煤气变换反应(WGSR)向体系提供活性氢(H·),提高CO初压促进了H·的生成,有利于H·向煤分子结构内部扩散实现加氢。同时,在CO初压为4.5MPa时,褐煤中的亚甲基、氧桥键和甲基侧链等会发生断裂,并生成大量自由基,提高了芳香片层的活动性,以促进褐煤中较小的芳香层片重排形成中等分子多环芳烃自由基,这些自由基可被体系中活性氢H·稳定而生成前沥青烯等黏结性物质,从而提高了煤的黏结性。						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1004-4248			CSCD:7052540

Here we report the influence of supporting electrolyte on the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide catalyzed by cobalt protoporphyrin. Phosphate anion strongly coordinates to the cobalt center leading to the positive movement of Co-III/Co-II , redox peak and the difficulty formation of carbon monoxide. Alkali cations, such as Li+, Na+ and K+, exhibit different catalytic activity and product selectivity. The efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction from direct proton (H+) reduction is increasing with the increase of the cation size. That is because the smaller cations preserve larger hydration number of water leading to geometrical hindrance, which hinders the diffusion of H+ to the electrode surface. On the contrary, the formation of CO and CH4 is decreasing with increasing of the cation size. This is resulted from the coordination of alkali cations to the oxygen atom of the key intermediate of CO2 electrochemical reduction, CO2-center dot anion, through ion-pairing. The smaller the cation size is, the stronger the ion-pairing is, helping the cleavage of one of the C-O bond. The deeper insight into the ionic effects and reaction mechanism of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 suggest new strategies for the utilization of CO2.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000452566600050

With small macrocycle N-substituents (R=H, Me), the complexes catalytically disproportionate H2O2 in aqueous solution; with a bulky substituent (R=tBu), this catalytic reaction is shut down, but the complex becomes active for aqueous electrocatalytic H2O oxidation. Control experiments are in support of a homogeneous molecular catalyst and preliminary mechanistic studies suggest that the catalyst is mononuclear.

Wet air oxidation (WAO), catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO), H2O2-promoted CWAO, wet peroxide oxidation (WPO) and catalytic wet peroxide oxidation (CWPO) were the options tested using different carbon-based catalysts, viz, activated carbon, carbon black and graphite. Their suitability was analyzed in terms of polyphenol, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) abatement upon 4 h reaction time. The results showed that hydrogen peroxide was the unique oxidant capable of achieving an effective reduction of the organic load. The graphite tested was the most active catalyst, most probably due in great part to its Fe content (0.4 wt.%), resistant to leaching.CWPO with that graphite was tested at different conditions following the evolution of COD, TOC and ecotoxicity. The best results were obtained by using graphite at 5 g/L, the original pH of the wastewater (3.8), 125 degrees C and the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide distributed in stepwise additions. Under those conditions, 80% COD and TOC removals with 85% of hydrogen peroxide efficiency were achieved after 4 h reaction time, giving rise to colorless effluents of very low Microtox ecotoxicity.

The composition of the primary slag was 20.5%Li2O-38.4%CaO-41.1%SiO2 (molar ratio = 1 : 1 : 1 ). The initial concentration of iron oxide was changed between 3% and 1 2.5%. The experimental temperature was 1 300-degrees-C. The rotation speed of the graphite cylinder was varied from zero to 1 900 rpm. The reaction rate was largely affected by slag foaming. At higher FeO concentrations, the apparent rate constant was almost independent of the mechanical stirring. At lower concentrations, the effect of the rotation on the apparent rate constant was found to be small at lower speeds but tended to become larger at higher speeds. This was an indication that the melt was strongly agitated by CO gas bubble evolution. The effect of foaming is taken into account by introducing gas holdup factor into ordinary (foam-free) kinetic equations. Values of the mass transfer coefficient of oxygen in the molten slag, calculated by applying the penetration theory, are close to those of the apparent rate constant, measured experimentally. This implies that the rate of the reduction is controlled predominantly by the mass transfer in the slag phase.									41	0	1	0	0	0	42			0915-1559			WOS:A1992JU02700006

PCC 7120 to a heme-binding protein with heme-degrading ability								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				203						110916	10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2019.110916				FEB 2020	2020	HutZ from Vibrio cholerae (VcHutZ) is a dimeric protein that catalyzes oxygen-dependent degradation of heme. The reaction mechanism is the same as that of canonical heme oxygenase (HO), but the structure of HutZ is quite different from that of HO. Thus, we postulate that HutZ has evolved via a different pathway from that of HO. The Alr5027 protein from cyanobacteria possessing proteins potentially related to ancestral proteins utilizing O-2 in enzymatic reactions is homologous to HutZ family proteins (67% similarity), but the heme axial ligand of HutZ is not conserved in Alr5027. To investigate whether Alr5027 can bind and degrade heme, we expressed Alr5027 in Escherichia coli and purified it. Although Alr5027 did not bind heme, replacement of Lys164, corresponding to the heme axial ligand of HutZ, with histidine conferred heme-binding capability. The K164H mutant produced verdoheme in the reaction with H2O2, indicating acquisition of heme-degradation ability. Among the mutants, the K164H mutant produced verdoheme most efficiently. Although the K164H mutant did not degrade heme through ascorbic acid, biliverdin, the final product of VcHutZ, was formed by treatment of verdoheme with ascorbic acid. An analysis of Trp103 fluorescence indicated elongation of the distance between protomers in this mutant compared with VcHutZ the probable cause of the inefficiency of ascorbic acid-supported heme-degradation activity. Collectively, our findings indicate that a single lysine-to-histidine mutation converted Alr5027 to a heme-binding protein that can form verdoheme through H2O2, suggesting that HutZ family proteins have acquired the heme-degradation function through molecular evolution from an ancestor protein of Alr5027.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0162-0134	1873-3344		WOS:000510109900028	31739124

Ni deposition was shown to be inhibited in the presence of CoSO4 in solution, whereas the rate of Co deposition was not accelerated and, in fact, completely unaffected by the presence of NiSO4. The extent of anomalous behavior was found to be affected strongly by the CoSO4 concentration, but was less pronounced when Co(II) reduction became mass transfer-controlled or the NiSO4 concentration exceeded the CoSO4 concentration by at least one order of magnitude. Analysis of the linear scans and measurement of the deposition current efficiencies indicated that the onset of reactions occurred in the following order with increasing cathodic overpotential: H+ reduction, Ni(II) reduction, Co(II) reduction and H2O reduction. Boric acid was found to have little effect on alloy composition whenever deposition occurred to any significant extent. On the other hand, the presence of boric acid was required to attain acceptably high current efficiencies over a wide range of current densities. Moreover, effective Co-Ni deposition was not possible in the absence of boric acid. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									31	2	0	0	0	0	32			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000301806600035

This technique was able to detect qualitatively the changes in the composition of the layer, particularly the in-depth H and O distribution during hydrogen uptake and release. The charge of the film with hydrogen was done under electrochemically controlled conditions, while the discharge was effectuated in different modes: electrochemically, in alkali electrolyte (forced anodic discharge) or spontaneously, in air ambient or in the electrolyte (open potential circuit discharge). In-depth GDOES profiles of hydrogen at different times during the charge/discharge process confirm the processes of capture/release of hydrogen into the film corresponding to a reversible transition between the two hydrogenation states of yttriurn: di- and tri-hydrides. The study of the oxygen profile reveals the presence of this element in the as prepared films and demonstrates its further accumulation under cyclic hydrogenation/dehydrogenation. Anodic discharge of the electrode rapidly increases oxygen content and probably leads to the formation of hydroxides along the whole yttrium depth with the consequent deterioration of the optical switching properties.

In this work, 2D CoTiO3/g-C3N4(CTO/CN) photocatalysts with an S-scheme heterojunction were prepared by in situ growth of CoTiO3 nanoparticles onto 2D porous g-C3N4 nanosheets. Compared with the pure g-C3N4, CTO/CN catalysts with different CTO contents exhibit excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance under visible light illumination. The unique band alignment of S-scheme heterojunctions not only suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs but also produces a sufficient photovoltage to drive the CO2 reduction reaction. Among them, the 2.0% CTO/CN sample exhibits the best photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to CO (at a rate of 236.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) and H-2 (at a rate of 75.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-))(1) which were 229.3 and 221.2 times higher than those of pure g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the 2.0% CTO/CN sample exhibits excellent photocatalytic stability during the photocatalytic CO2 reduction cycle reaction. This work provides a new insight into the design of S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-4902			WOS:000861546600001

The advantages of catalytically active sites of the 2D layered structure of transition-metal dichalcogenides/oxides is integrated with the distinctive dimensionality-dependent phenomena of 1D structure to achieve enormous surface area for light harvesting and photoelectrochemical reaction, along with the favorable photocarrier dynamics required for water splitting. The ZnO/MoS2 and ZnO/MoO3 nanoheterostructure photoanodes exhibit low onset potential and enhanced broadband light absorption, resulting in high photocurrent densities of 2.04 and 0.67 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which corrospond to 334% and 43% increases in photocurrent, respectively, compared to that of pure ZnO nanorods. The nanoheterostructure photoanodes also exhibit enhanced applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency and superior spatial photo-induced exciton separation and transportation, because of the favorable interfacial band alignment at 2D-1D nanoheterointerfaces, and suppress the surface charge recombination, which promotes hole transportation at the nanoheterostructure/electrolyte interface and boost the surface oxygen evolution reaction, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical performance.									14	1	0	0	2	0	14			2574-0970			WOS:000517856800032

Journal of the American Chemical Society				144	27			12127	12137		10.1021/jacs.2c02636				2022-Jul-13	2022	Embedding metal species into zeolite frameworks can create framework-bond metal sites in a confined microenvironment. The metals sitting in the specific T sites of zeolites and their crystalline surroundings are both committed to the interaction with the reactant, participation in the activation, and transient state achievement during the whole catalytic process. Herein, we construct isolated Co-motifs into purely siliceous MFI zeolite frameworks (Co-MFI) and reveal the location and microenvironment of the isolated Co active center in the MFI zeolite framework particularly beneficial for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The isolated Co-motif with the distorted tetrahedral structure ({(=SiO)2Co(HO-Si=)2}, two Co-O-Si bonds, and two pseudobridging hydroxyls (Co···OH-Si) is located at T1(7) and T3(9) sites of the MFI zeolite. DFT calculations and deuterium-labeling reactions verify that the isolated Co-motif together with the MFI microenvironment collectively promotes the PDH reaction by providing an exclusive microenvironment to preactivate C3H8, polarizing the oxygen in Co-O-Si bonds to accept H* ({(=SiO)CoHdelta- (Hdelta+O-Si=)3}), and a scaffold structure to stabilize the C3H7* intermediate. The Co-motif active center in Co-MFI goes through the dynamic evolutions and restoration in electronic states and coordination states in a continuous and repetitive way, which meets the requirements from the series of elementary steps in the PDH catalytic cycle and fulfills the successful catalysis like enzyme catalysis.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3				1520-5126		MEDLINE:35762495	35762495

Although active research on the design DACs has been ongoing for almost a decade, little attention has been paid to the detailed catalytic mechanisms. Based on density functional theory (DFT) analysis, the iron dimer embedded in N-containing graphene (FeFe@N6) has the most excellent adsorption properties of O2 and CO among DACs systems (M1M2@N6, M1/M2 = Fe, Co, Ni). We considered the influence of N atoms concentration and position on the adsorption performance and stability of the iron dimer, FeFe@N6 was screened as a potential DAC. We systematically studied the catalytic mechanisms of CO oxidation on FeFe@N6 and its monometallic counterpart (VFe@N6). CO oxidation on FeFe@N6 along the Eley-Rideal (ER) and termolecular Eley-Rideal (TER) mechanisms needs to overcome the low energy barriers of 0.513 eV and 0.299 eV, which is smaller than the maximum energy barrier (0.584 eV) of CO oxidation along the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) mechanism on VFe@N6. Therefore, FeFe@N6 has high activity for CO oxidation, which can provide useful guidance for the development of low-cost and efficient green DACs.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000655640100003

When determined by the light-induced absorbance change at lambda-820 nm, blue light-adapted cells possess about 60 % more reaction centres per total chlorophyll in photosystem II. Correspondingly, the cells exhibit about 30 % more Hill activity of PS II. Conversely, red light-adapted cells contain relatively more reaction centres and higher electron flow capacities of photosystem I. The distribution of total chlorophyll among the pigment-protein complexes, CPI, CPIa, CPa, and LHC II, corresponds to these data. There is more chlorophyll associated with the light-harvesting complex of PS II, LHC II, in cells under blue light conditions, but more chlorophyll bound to both complexes of PS I, CPI and CPIa, in cells under red light conditions. The respective ratios of chlorophyll a/chlorophyll b of all complexes are identical for blue and red light-adapted cells. This results in a higher relative amount of chlorophyll b in blue light-adapted cells.Total carotenoids per total chlorophyll are increased by 20 % in red light-adapted cells. Their distribution among the pigment-protein complexes is unknown, however the ratios of lutein, neoxanthin and violaxanthin extractable from LHC II are different in blue (32.1: 35.9: 32.0) and in red (51.4: 26.7: 21.9) light-adapted cells.									8	0	0	0	7	0	8			0932-8629			WOS:A1992JD29100006

In this study, nitrogen as a heteroatom is introduced to the CoO nanoneedle arrays grown on the carbon cloth (N-CoO NAs/CC), and the effects of nitrogen on the electrochemical behavior of Li-O2 batteries are comprehensively studied by experimental and theoretical calculations. With the incorporation of nitrogen, the catalytic activity of the prepared cathode is heavily enhanced through a combined set of factors, including enhanced electronic conductivity, optimized reactant/intermediates affinity, as well as improved reaction kinetics. In addition, further investigation on the morphology of the discharge products demonstrates that the introduction of nitrogen can also promote the solvation discharge path of the battery, which is conducive to the release of the battery capacity. Moreover, the introduction of nitrogen makes the discharge products on the cathode show nano-sheet structure, which is easier to be decomposed during charging. The electrochemical performances of the N-CoO NAs/CC cathode including battery cycle efficiency, capacity and cycle stability are heavily enhanced due to the above advantages. The combination of doping engineering and electrochemical performances provides an ingenious way to develop a new type of economic and efficient cathode for Li-O2 batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000804623800001

Although immense experimental works were carried out for identifying the thermal degradation and oxidation process of graphene, they generally lack atomistic-level observation of the surface reactions, thermal formation pathways from solid to product volatiles and structural evolutions during oxidation. To analyse the favourable properties of graphene from its carbon-chain molecular structure viewpoint, it is essential to investigate graphene-based materials at an atomic level. This study bridges the missing knowledge by performing quantitative reactive forcefield coupled molecular dynamics simulation (MD-ReaxFF) to determine the oxidation kinetics of graphite under computational characterisation schemes with temperatures ranging from 4000 K to 6000 K. The kinetics parameters (i.e. activation energy) were extracted through proposed numerical characterisation methods and demonstrated good agreement with the thermogravimetric analysis experiments and other literature. Activation energy at 193.84 kJ/mol and 224.26 kJ/mol were extracted under the isothermal scheme by two distinct characterisation methods, achieving an average relative error of 11.3 % and 2.5 % compared to the experiment data, which is 218.60 kJ/mol. In comparison, the non-isothermal simulations yielded 214.53 kJ/mol, with a significant improvement on the average relative error of 1.86 %.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-0256	1879-0801		WOS:000797836500003

However, it is limited because of the lack of direct spectroscopic evidence of the intermediates formed on the electrodes during catalytic turnover. Recently, surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy coupled to rotating disk electrochemistry (SERRS-RDE) has been developed in our laboratory that can be used to study O-2 reduction by iron porphyrin electrocatalysts under physiological conditions. While reaction intermediates are commonly trapped and characterized in single turnover experiments, SERRS-RDE experiments, on the other hand, probe the system while it is under steady-state conditions. A combination of oxidation state, coordination number, and spin state marker bands, along with the metal ligand vibrations, allowed unprecedented direct identification of O-2-derived intermediates formed in situ on the electrode surface during electrocatalysis.

THE EFFECT OF ACRYLONITRILE CONTENT ON THE THERMOOXIDATIVE AGING OF NITRILE RUBBER								RUBBER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY				87	1			53	69		10.5254/rct.13.87937				JAN-MAR 2014	2014	The level of thermo-oxidative degradation in a series of unstabilized and unfilled nitrile rubbers (NBR) varying in acrylonitrile (ACN) content (18-43.5 wt%) was investigated on heat-aged samples (40-120 degrees C) by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. A similar degradation profile evolution was observed regardless of ACN content with the generation of hydroxyl-, carbonyl-, and ester-based products with a concomitant loss of the 1,4-trans, 1,4-cis, and 1,2-vinyl butadienes. The magnitude of IR active group absorption loss is greatest in the lowest ACN NBR concentration and steadily lessens toward higher ACN levels (1,4-cis > 1,2-vinyl > 1,4-trans >> butadiene methylenes). The 18% ACN NBR possesses two distinct kinetically different degradation regimes (80-120 and 40-80 degrees C). Activation energies by carbonyl growth and 1,4-trans loss increase from 71 to 87 kJ mol(-1) and from 71 to 79 kJ mol(-1) respectively, for decreasing ACN (43.5-18%) content. The rate of consumption of the 1,4-trans butadiene group is mainly affected by therrno-oxidative carbonyl-based and addition-cross-linking reactions, the latter being lower in activation energy for low to mid ACN NBRs. The high oxidation rate behavior of the lowest acrylonitrile rubber is attributed to its higher oxygen permeability rates. Cross-linking due to addition-type reactions is favored for higher 1,4 unsaturation levels.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0035-9475	1943-4804		WOS:000337203200006

In protic media and particular aqueous electrolytes BDD exhibits a large over potential for the evolution of molecular hydrogen and oxygen. The large chemical window allows a variety of electrochemical conversions to be conducted. The anodic process treatment generates oxyl species directly which are known to be extremely reactive. Usually, the electrochemical mineralization of the organic components in the electrolyte occurs. However, with control of the reactivity of these intermediates the use in electroorganic synthesis can be realized. Until today mostly anodic conversions have been studied at BDD. Since hydroxyl radicals can be efficiently formed and exhibit an enormous oxidative power they are exploited for the electroorganic synthesis. In general, two strategies can be applied to circumvent electrochemical incineration: First, the substrate serves as solvent and partial conversion exploits statistics to gain selectivity for the desired product. This particular approach is useful when the excess of substrate can subsequently be evaporated, and is readily available and inexpensive. The second strategy uses fluorinated alcohols as additives which enlarge the chemical window. The specific role of these fluorinated solvents can be attributed to the stabilization of hydroxyl or methoxyl radicals by supramolecular taming of these intermediates. Moreover, these additives paved the way to the first anodic phenol-arene cross-coupling reaction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

High densities of atomic insertion in a solid can result in dramatic structural transformations and associated changes in mechanical behavior: This is particularly evident during electrochemical cycling of novel battery electrodes, such as alloying anodes, conversion oxides, and sulfur and oxygen cathodes. Silicon, which undergoes 400% volume expansion when alloying with lithium, is an extreme case and represents an excellent model system for study. Here, we show that fracture locations are highly anisotropic for lithiation of crystalline Si nanopillars and that fracture is strongly correlated with previously discovered anisotropic expansion. Contrary to earlier theoretical models based on diffusion-induced stresses where fracture is predicted to occur in the core of the pillars during lithiation, the observed cracks are present only in the amorphous lithiated shell. We also show that the critical fracture size is between about 240 and 360 nm and that it depends on the electrochemical reaction rate.									319	11	0	0	18	0	325			0027-8424			WOS:000301426700019	22371565

A diffusion flame generated from a porous ethylene burner discharging into a parallel oxidizer flow provided a laminar boundary layer. All experiments were conducted in parabolic flights that provide twenty-two seconds of microgravity conditions. Soot production was tracked using the laser-induced incandescence technique, while the spontaneous emission of OH* was used in order to identify the reaction zone. The study was focused on the influence of the oxygen index, the oxidizer flow velocity, and the fuel injection velocity on the flame geometry, characterized by the stand-off distance, flame length and the soot production. A dimensionless procedure of transport equations and a scaling analysis were carried out in order to interpret the experimental results and to understand the flame extinction process at the trailing edge. The stand-off distance is found to exhibit three regimes as the distance from the burner leading edge increases: a convection-controlled regime close to the burner leading edge, followed by a diffusion-controlled regime and then a third regime at the burner trailing edge due to the appearance of tridimensional effects. Experimental results shows that the flame length decrease with the oxygen index and increases with the fuel injection velocity and the oxidizer velocity. This latter evolution is opposite to that observed in 'closed-tip' diffusion flame, showing that the flame length is controlled by radiant quenching at the flame trailing edge. Concerning soot production, it is observed that the characteristic length scale of soot volume fraction evolves in an opposite manner with the flame length, showing that this latter is not relevant to define the soot residence time. A residence time based on the integrated soot volume fraction and on the oxidizer flow was found appropriate to study soot formation processes. (C) 2016 by The Combustion Institute.

The use of manganese oxide films has been explored, but while they may be catalytically active on the surface, their poor conductivity hinders their overall performance. We have approached this problem by using manganese oxide nanoparticles with sizes of 4, 6 and 8 nm, produced in a sputter-gas-aggregation source and soft-landed onto conducting electrodes. The mass loading of these catalytic particles was kept constant and corresponded to 45%-80% of a monolayer coverage. Measurements of the water oxidation threshold revealed that the onset potential decreases significantly with decreasing particle size. The final stoichiometry of the catalytically active nanoparticles, after exposure to air, was identified as predominantly MnO. The ability of such a sub-monolayer film to lower the reaction threshold implies that the key role is played by intrinsic size effects, i.e., by changes in the electronic properties and surface fields of the nanoparticles with decreasing size. We anticipate that this work will serve to bridge the knowledge gap between bulk thick film electrocatalysts and natural photosynthetic molecular-cluster complexes.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000428921700001	29517487

However, these strategies either suffer from low efficiency and spatial and temporal limitations or require a large amount of energy and CO2 gas of high purity. These shortcomings can be addressed by the development of a green, renewable electrochemical system that directly fixes atmospheric CO2 to generate biomass chemicals. Here, we present a flow electrochemical microbial CO2 fixation system (EMCF) based on the propagation of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in the presence of Fe2+/Fe3+ as redox mediators. We demonstrate that the overpotential is significantly reduced by the in situ-formed Fe2CoSe4 electrocatalysts, which results in an energy consumption of 15.6 GJ per ton fixed CO2 when paired with the oxygen evolution reaction. We show that the energy consumption can be reduced to 0.62 GJ/t when KI is used for selective 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation and can even supply an energy of 10.08 GJ/t at low current density. This study demonstrates that the proposed EMCF system has the potential to be a sustainable and carbon-negative platform that can convert atmospheric CO2 into value-added biomass chemicals and realize the selective oxidation of a broad range of chemicals simultaneously.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000737962600001

In this study, we used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the distribution of the adsorption modes of ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte molecules and EC decomposition reactions on the (100) surfaces of lithiated (pristine) and delithiated forms of spinel-type LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as model cathode surfaces. DFT molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that EC molecules have two characteristic adsorption modes. These two modes can satisfactorily explain the experimental observations and suggest a new feature of electrolyte-cathode interfaces in terms of the control of interfacial dipoles. On the basis of the DFT-MD results, we examined several possible pathways of EC decomposition on the LNMO (100) surfaces and estimated their activation barriers. We then found that the pristine LNMO (100) surface was inert with respect to the EC decomposition, whereas on delithiated surfaces, twofold-coordinated surface oxygen atoms generated by the delithiation process served as active sites for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon and the methylene group of adsorbed EC molecules. The induction of ring opening of the EC molecule by the former attack, and hydrogen abstraction from the methylene group and subsequent CO2 generation by the latter were consistent with experimental observations.									15	2	0	0	1	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000457816600027

However, the high overpotential of N-2 activation and low solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency remain challenging in practical application. In the present work, we propose that introducing sp-hybridized boron atoms into metal-free triphenylene-graphdiyne monolayer (B@TP-GDY) would be a promising solution to achieve highly efficient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under visible and even infrared light. Based on first-principles calculations and the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics method, we find that spin-polarization on sp-hybridized B sites plays a key role in activating N-2 molecules through the "acceptance-donation" concept, enabling the NRR process to be driven effectively by the photogenerated electrons. Besides, B@TP-GDY monolayers exhibit a high selectivity towards NH3 production with perfect suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Moreover, the defect states induced by B atoms not only enhance the light absorption ability, but also significantly suppress the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The predicted photogenerated carrier lifetime of B@TP-GDY, 198 ps, is about twice that of the pristine TP-GDY monolayer, 110 ps. Our finding broadens the understanding of B-based photocatalytic mechanism for N-2 fixation and provides a feasible route to design metal-free NRR photocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000715428500001

Therefore, there is an increasing interest in developing alternative and environmental friendly approaches. Among the possible solutions, the electrocatalytic conversion of N-2 has recently gained significant attention; on the other hand, not only scientific but also important technical aspects remain fundamental issues to be clarified. Particularly relevant is the need to improve the analytical protocols to ascertain that any detected NH3 is actually produced from N-2 rather than from any external contaminations or partial decomposition of the catalyst itself. Here, a rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) setup is used for the first time to study the N-2 electroreduction process with the aim to recognize the product species formed at the disc and detected at the ring electrodes, respectively. We demonstrated that this experimental approach is effective to discern also a low-level ammonium concentration through monitoring the ammonia oxidation peak at the ring electrode for a fast and preliminary electrocatalytic performance evaluation and to prevent false positives. The versatility of the RRDE method employed as a fingerprint of new electrocatalyst candidates could allow to reserve time and cost.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000584861100001

In this Review, recent progress of electrochemical CO2 splitting from a fundamental understanding to practical control of the main performance index, including production rate, product selectivity, and energetic efficiency, is discussed with the highlight of the methodologies used to increase CO2 supply in water media and active site design. The roles of the main components in electrochemical CO2 splitting devices, such as catalyst, electrode, electrolyzer, membrane, and electrolyte, are discussed. Finally, we also provide personal perspectives to highlight the opportunities to overcome low stability and limited selectivity for practical electrochemical CO2 splitting.									15	1	0	0	1	0	15			2196-0216			WOS:000463752300001		
J	Aoyama, Chika; Suzuki, Hiroyuki; Sugiura, Miwa; Noguchi, Takumi				Noguchi, Takumi/I-7105-2014				Flash-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy shows no evidence for the structural coupling of bicarbonate to the oxygen-evolving Mn cluster in photosystem II								BIOCHEMISTRY				47	9			2760	2765		10.1021/bi702241t				MAR 4 2008	2008	Bicarbonate is known to be required for the maximum activity of photosystem II. Although it is well established that bicarbonate is bound to the northeme iron to regulate the quinone reactions, the effect of bicarbonate on oxygen evolution is still controversial, and its binding site and exact physiological roles remain to be clarified. In this study, the structural coupling of bicarbonate to the oxygen-evolving center (OEC) was studied using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. Flash-induced FTIR difference spectra during the S-state cycle of OEC were recorded using the PSII core complexes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus in the presence of either unlabeled bicarbonate or C-13-bicarbonate. The (HCO3)-C-12-minus-(HCO3)-C-13-double difference spectra showed prominent bicarbonate bands at the first flash, whereas no appreciable bands were detected at the second to fourth flashes. The bicarbonate bands at the, first flash were virtually identical to those from the nonheme iron, which was preoxidized by ferricyanide and photoreduced by a single flash, recorded using Mn-depleted PSII complexes. Using the bicarbonate bands of the nonheme iron as an internal standard, it was concluded that no bicarbonate band arising from OEC exists in the S-state FTIR spectra. This conclusion indicates that bicarbonate is not affected by the structural changes in OEC upon the four S-state transitions. It is thus strongly suggested that bicarbonate is neither a ligand to the Mn cluster nor a cofactor closely coupled to OEC, although the possibility cannot be fully excluded that nonexchangeable bicarbonate exists in OEC as a constituent of the Mn-cluster core. The data also provide strong evidence that bicarbonate does not function as a substrate or a catalytic intermediate. Bicarbonate may play major roles in the photoassembly process of the Mn cluster and in the stabilization of OEC by a rather indirect interaction.									28	1	0	0	19	0	28			0006-2960			WOS:000253461000007	18217717

Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels such as natural gas and coal, producing CO2. Water electrolysis is a promising technology for fossil-free, CO2-free hydrogen production. Proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolysis also eliminates the need for caustic electrolyte, and has been proven at megawatt scale. However, a major cost driver is the electrode, specifically the cost of electrocatalysts used to improve the reaction efficiency, which are applied at high loadings (>3 mg/cm(2) total platinum group metal (PGM) content). Core-shell catalysts have shown improved activity for hydrogen production, enabling reduced catalyst loadings, while reactive spray deposition techniques (RSDT) have been demonstrated to enable manufacture of catalyst layers more uniformly and with higher repeatability than existing techniques. Core-shell catalysts have also been fabricated with RSDT for fuel cell electrodes with good performance. Manufacturing and materials need to go hand in hand in order to successfully fabricate electrodes with ultra-low catalyst loadings (<0.5 mg/cm(2) total PGM content) without significant variation in performance. This paper describes the potential for these two technologies to work together to enable low cost PEM electrolysis systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Back-scattered electron imaging suggests that secondary porosity formed by dissolution of K-feldspars, calcicplagioclases, and calcite and ankerite cements constitutes the dominant sandstone porosity.Three factors were examined to explain the observed secondary porosity: organic acids and CO2 generated from thermal maturation of organic matter, undersaturated meteoric water, and clay-carbonate reactions.In the Albert Formation sandstones, high secondary porosity occurs in association with oxygen-rich organic matter. This porosity occurs at a temperature at which organic acids and CO2 production is at its maximum. However, mass balance considerations do not support organic acids and CO2 as the main mechanism for secondary porosity formation. Consideration of the timing of dissolution, its relation to unconformities, and absence of biodegradation or water washing of the crude oils also indicate that meteoric water was not the principal agent in secondary porosity formation.We conclude that mineral-mineral reactions were probably the most important pore-forming process. This conclusion is supported by the abundances of kaolinite, mixed-layer illite/smectite, smectite, chlorite, and carbonates in the early mature, moderately porous sandstones of the Dover and Albert Mines areas compared with the more mature and more porous sandstones of the Stoney Creek oil and gas field.									7	2	0	0	0	0	9			0149-1423			WOS:A1992JL11200003

The source of light in natural habitats has heretofore been thought to be the sun, thus restricting photosynthesis to solar photic environments on the surface of the Earth. If photosynthesis could take place in geothermally illuminated environments, it would increase the diversity of photosynthetic habitats both on Earth and on other worlds that have been proposed to possibly harbor life. Green sulfur bacteria are anaerobes that require light for growth by the oxidation of sulfur compounds to reduce CO2 to organic carbon, and are capable of photosynthetic growth at extremely low light intensities. We describe the isolation and cultivation of a previously unknown green sulfur bacterial species from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent, where the only source of light is geothermal radiation that includes wavelengths absorbed by photosynthetic pigments of this organism.									229	8	0	0	153	1	246			0027-8424	1091-6490		WOS:000230191400040	15967984

All calculations are performed with open-source, freely available codes.Results: Recent reaction rate updates tend to decrease by similar to 4x the explosive helium-burning yield of N-15 relative to some commonly used stellar model outputs.Conclusions: Neutron-capture reactions on F-18 play an important role in the explosive production of N-15 in helium-rich stellar layers. This neutron-induced nucleosynthesis is likely connected to that of other isotopic signatures in presolar supernova grains. The Supplemental Material provides instructions that interested readers can follow for their own calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis and nuclear reaction rate sensitivities.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000332166000005

Herein, well-designed nanofiber-like heteroatom-doped carbons with MoP nanocrystals coated on carbon cloth (MoP@NPCF/CC) were prepared through the direct pyrolysis of organophosphonic moiety-modified polyaniline with molybdate. The polymer-confinement effect and in situ phosphorization of this synthetic approach not only impedes the aggregation of metal nanocrystals, but also achieves significantly intimate interaction between the MoP nanocrystals and the conductive carbon nanofibers. Benefiting from the abundant MoP nanocrystals and the doped N and P atoms, and the hierarchical nanofiber structure with binder-free properties, the resultant MoP@NPCF/CC exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen production with the low overpotentials of 115 and 182 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in H2SO4 and KOH electrolytes, together with robust operation durability. In particular, the N,P-codoped carbon nanofibers (NPCF/CC) display high oxygen evolution performance in a KOH medium. Furthermore, employing MoP@NPCF/CC as a cathode and NPCF/CC as an anode, an alkaline electrolyzer configuration achieves the overall current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.64 V, associated with excellent stability. This approach for fabricating such nanostructures will provide new inspiration for exploring advanced electrocatalysts for various energy-related applications.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10				2052-1537		WOS:000482454500018

Commercially available CeO2 (60 m(2)/g) and high-surface-area CeO2 (synthesized in-house; 220 m(2)/g) were doped with nitrogen by annealing in a nitrogen rich atmosphere. The evolution of CeO2 microstructure in Nitrogen doped (N-doped) commercial CeO2 (20 m(2)/g) and N-doped high-surface-area CeO2 (90 m(2)/g) was studied. XPS and Raman measurements revealed that N-doping of CeO2 enhanced Ce3+ surface concentration and concomitantly increased surface non-stoichiometry (surface oxygen vacancy concentration). XRD analysis of the doped samples confirmed that the nitrogen atom replaced the oxygen atom in the CeO2 lattice, yielding a lower electron density region around the N-doped sites. The high-surface-area CeO2 and its N-doped version had significantly larger lattice parameters than that of commercial CeO2 and its doped version. XAS studies revealed that the N-doped high-surface-area CeO2 had more Ce3+ active clusters than its counterparts, and effectively retained its active Ce3+ active clusters upon exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS). To confirm, the regenerative ROS (hydroxyl radical) scavenging ability of N-doped CeO2 nanoparticles within the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) of an operating polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) was evaluated using in-situ fluorescence spectroscopy. The N-doped high-surface-area CeO2 showed at least 100 hours of efficient and quantitative ROS scavenging under harsh conditions - a 15-fold improvement over previous reports. This study unequivocally demonstrates that N-doping increases both the number of Ce3+ active clusters in the lattice and the Ce-O bond distance; these structural attributes enhance regenerative ROS scavenging activity of CeO2.

This study proposes a bilayered materials design approach obtained by hot pressing and is concerned with the influence of sintering pressure on the interface reaction between titanium alloy (Ti6AI4V) and zirconia (ZrO2), on density and mechanical properties of the Ti6AI4V-ZrO2. For this purpose, different sintering pressures were studied (P = 5, 20 and 100 MPa). Bilayered materials were produced by hot pressing process, at T = 1175 degrees C. Microstructural characterization showed that Ti6AI4V reacts with ZrO2 (for P >= 20 MPa) and that the interface reaction is strongly dependent on pressure. Additionally, an oxygen-deficient ZrO2 _ (x) black zirconia layer was obtained for specimens produced at P = 20 and 100 MPa as result of decreased O/Zr ratio due to Ti diffusion into ZrO2 side. Young's modulus and hardness properties were evaluated by nano indentation test. The results showed that these properties are influenced by sintering pressure, increasing with an increase on sintering pressure, with the highest improvement for specimens produced at higher pressure.

J	Schmidt, Astrid; Gube, Matthias; Schmidt, Andre; Kothe, Erika					Gube, Matthias/0000-0001-5101-3096			In silico analysis of nickel containing superoxide dismutase evolution and regulation								JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY				49	1	SI		109	118		10.1002/jobm.200800293				FEB 2009	2009	Superoxide dismutases are essential enzymes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen by dismutation of the superoxide radical anion. A class of nickel containing superoxide dismutases has been described for streptomycetes and cyanobacteria. In silico analysis was used to study the distribution of genes coding for NiSOD in other taxa and to elucidate signals linked to nickel incorporation and maturation of NiSOD. Data mining revealed homologous proteins from actinobacteria, proteobacteria, chlamydiae, and eukarya (green algae) thus allowing a comparison of protein structural elements. Nickel ligands and maturation signals for N-terminal proteolysis were highly conserved. Genomic sequences surrounding genes encoding NiSOD homologs were compared in order to detect putative accessory enzymes involved in maturation. An endopeptidase gene linked to sodN coding for NiSOD was found in actinobacteria and cyanobacteria, but not in other taxa. The distribution of NiSOD encoding sequences showed four clusters which are not consistent with the phylogeny of the species. In addition, the different genomic context argues for heterologous gene transfer, most likely from actinobacteria to other taxa. In order to address regulation by nickel availability and incorporation into the mature protein, we present first evidence for putative regulatory nucleotide sequences which will be useful in future studies on nickel uptake and incorporation.									25	3	0	0	21	0	28			0233-111X	1521-4028		WOS:000264348600012	19253325

In the soot model, acetylene (C2H2) is soot precursor and surface growth species, while hydroxyl radical (OH) and oxygen (O-2) are soot oxidizers. The effect of ambient CO2 and H2O additions on soot formation/oxidation can be separated into thermal and chemical effects. For the thermal effects, the ambient CO2 and H2O additions increase C2H2 but reduce OH formation by lowering the flame temperature. This leads to a higher soot mass formed. On the contrary to the thermal effects, the ambient CO2 and H2O additions reduce the soot formation due to their chemical effects. The reaction CH2* + CO2 <-> CH2O + CO is found to be responsible for reducing C2H2 formation. The ambient H2O addition results in a higher OH but lower the C2H2 mass formed owing to the reverse reactions H-2 + OH <-> H2O + H and OH + OH <-> H2O + O. Furthermore, the chemical effects is more significant than the thermal effects under the tested conditions. This leads to a lower soot mass formed when adding ambient CO2 and H2O.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000766444200004		
J	Xiong, Bo; Yang, Yingju; Liu, Jing; Ding, Junyan; Yang, Yuchen								Crystal orientation effects on the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to syngas over Cu-M (M = Ag, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pd) bimetal catalysts								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				567						150839	10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.150839		AUG 2021		NOV 30 2021	2021	CO2 electrochemical reduction to syngas (CO2RR-to-syngas) is an environment friendly and promising CO2 utilization technology. However, there are still few efficient catalysts for CO2RR-to-syngas electrolysis. The crystal orientation regulation is one of the important methods to enhance the activity of catalyst and there is still a lack of systematic research in this field. In this work, a comparative study of the Cu-M bimetal catalysts (BMCs) for CO2RR-to-syngas is carried out using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the crystal orientation effects. The results indicate that the reaction barrier is significantly changed on different crystal orientations. Gibbs free energy change of the potential limiting step (Delta G(PLS)) on the Cu (110) surface is lower than those on the Cu (1 1 1) and Cu (100) surfaces. The Cu-Pd catalyst exhibits better catalytic activity for HER than Cu-Ag, Cu-Ni, Cu-Zn, and Cu-Cd catalysts. CO2RR activity of the Cu-Pd catalyst is better than that of most of the catalysts reported so far. The Cu-Ni catalyst exposing the Cu(100) surface is the only catalyst which is more favorite to CO2RR than HER. This work provides guidance for the design of highly efficient catalysts for CO2RR-to-syngas.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691195700001

In order to tackle these issues, here a one-dimensional photoanode is designed by electrodepositing a p-ZnCo2O4 nanolayer on n-TiO2 nanotubes surface and finally electrochemically coupling the TiO2/ZnCo2O4 surface with an ultrathin layer of the cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) catalyst nanoparticles. These typical TiO2/ZnCo2O4@Co-Pi nanoheterostructures exhibit a remarkably enhanced visible light driven photoelectrochemical property with applied bias photoconversion efficiency (ABPE) similar to 3% at 0.2 V vs NHE. The TiO2/ZnCo2O4@Co-Pi nanoheterostructures also show enhanced visible light absorption with large photocurrent density similar to 440% higher than that of the TiO2 nanotubes electrode at 1.2 V vs Ag/AgCl and significantly low onset potential for water oxidation. Studies on the transient photocurrent and flat-band potential demonstrate the remarkable improvement in the photogenerated charge carrier separation or reduced recombination because of the favorable band alignment at the heterointerface. The Co-Pi catalyst further boosts the water oxidation reaction by reducing electronhole pair recombination through the suppression of the surface trap states. Moreover, Co-Pi also serves as a hole-acceptor layer, improving the charge-transfer kinetics for an enhanced photoelectrochemical performance.									37	0	0	0	5	0	37			1932-7447			WOS:000416496200011

The main reaction products obtained from the photocatalytic oxidation of 20% formaldehyde were hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The ratio of evolved H-2 to CO2 was to 2/1. The HD gas yield was found to be dependent on the solvent and was maximized in a H2O/D2O mixture (20%180%). The study of the solvent isotope effect on the degradation of formaldehyde indicates that the mineralization rate of formaldehyde (CO2) decreases considerably when the concentration of D2O is increased. On the basis of the ATR-FTIR data, the formaldehyde in D2O is gradually converted to deuterated formic acid during UV irradiation, which was confirmed by different band shifting. An additional FTIR band at 2050 cm(-1) assigned to CO was detected and was found to increase during UV irradiation due to the adsorption of molecular CO on Pt/TiO2. The results of these investigations showed that the molecular hydrogen is mainly produced by the reduction of two protons originating from water and formaldehyde. A detailed mechanism for the simultaneous hydrogen production and formaldehyde oxidation in D2O is also presented.									47	1	0	0	6	0	47			2155-5435			WOS:000405360800066

To minimize the negative impacts from coke formation, the key point is to fully understand the formation and evolution of coke during the thermal treatment of bio-oil. Thus, in this study, the cokes formed from the pyrolysis of bio-oil at different temperatures (300-800 degrees C) and heating rates were characterized by using a range of advanced analytical instruments. The evolution of cokes (e.g. morphology, elemental composition, chemical structure and concentration of radicals) with increasing temperature and heating rate was traced. The results show that the cokes generated at slow heating rates are imporous with smooth surface but porous at high temperatures and fast heating rates. The radical concentration of the cokes reaches the highest level at 600 degrees C, then decreases rapidly with further increasing temperature to form more free radicals, which promote the condensation reaction of aromatic systems to form larger ring structures of the coke at high temperatures, with lower H/C and O/C ratios. The O-containing functional groups could be brought into the coke via the interactions between light and heavy components of bio-oil.									36	5	0	0	3	0	39			0165-2370	1873-250X		WOS:000445306600036

Mesoporous cobalt hydroxide and cobalt oxide nanoparticles were prepared through simple soft chemistry as high-performance materials for durable electrocatalyst for OER and supercapacitive applications. The synthesis method is used to prepare nanoring particles in neither emulsion nor template-directed method. The final nanoparticles display mesoporous hexagonal nanoring morphology. The physio-chemical properties of the assynthesized nanoparticles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption techniques. The TEM characterizations prove that NPs retain the topotactical relationship in their structure during the conversion process. The BET measurements prove the mesoporous nature of the nanorings, having good specific surface area and pore volume. Finally, the electrochemical performance toward water splitting and supercapacitor applications were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques. The Co3O4 NPs exhibits better catalytic properties than Co(OH)(2) NPs when applied as electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium for water splitting and supercapacitor measurements. The enhanced electrocatalytic performance attributed to the mesoporous structure along with high pore volume, which provides more active boundary sites for the electrochemical process, resulted in the enhanced exchange of the intermediates and more efficient electron transfer. This synthetic methodology, with the advantages of inexpensive/non-complicated experimental setup and high electrochemical performance, could shed light on the development of non-expensive electrocatalysts for clean energy production and storage.

In order to improve the industrial application prospects and electrochemical performance of hydrogen evolution catalysts, extensive research on transition metal materials has been carried out. Among the many catalytic materials, cobalt is an element with potential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to its abundant reserves, low cost, and small energy barrier for H adsorption. This review classifies the latest research on cobalt-based catalysts according to the types of compound, including cobalt-based sulfides, phosphides, carbides, borides, oxides, etc., and summarizes the latest research progress of cobalt-based compound catalysts in acidic and alkaline media. Strategies to tune the properties of cobalt-based compound catalysts for high catalytic activity for HER are focused on, including structural engineering, defect engineering, and doping, etc. The advantages and limitations of each modified approach are reviewed. Not only that, but also the catalytic activity and advantages of the catalyst are evaluated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculation-related descriptors, activity evaluation parameters, etc. Finally, limitations and challenges of cobalt-based materials for HER are presented, as well as prospects for future research. This paper aims to understand the chemical and physical factors that affect cobalt-based catalysts, and to find directions for future research on cobalt-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000855402200001	36125033

The products were characterized by XRD, IR, DCS-TG and SEM techniques, and electrochemical investigations by cyclic voltammetry, charge-discharge tests and EIS measurements, which confirmed the excellent supercapacitive performance of the Co3O4 nanoplates including their high contribution and electrochemical utilization in the redox reactions, reversible redox reactions, low diffusion resistance, high specific capacitance of 485 F g(-1), and an 84.1 % capacity retention after 3000 cycling at the applied discharge current density of 5 A g(-1).									53	0	0	0	0	1	53			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000379803200120

However, new non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for the HER are required to reduce the consumption of energy. Herein, we report a new Co2P/WC nano-heterojunction that consists of Co2P and WC composite phases coated with a few-layer N-doped graphitic carbon shells (Co2P/WC@NC). The composite was prepared by a one-step annealing of the polyoxometalate Na-9(NH4)(5)[{(B-alpha-PW9O34)Co-3(OH)(H2O)(2)(Ale)}(2)Co]center dot 35H(2)O (Co7P6W18) and dicyandiamide (DCA). The preparation method consisted of the simultaneous phosphorization of Co and carbonization of W in a confined space to isolate a Co2P/WC nano-heterojunction phase for the first time. Co2P/WC@NC facilitated the generation of hydrogen in the electrolysis process, which had an overpotential of only 91 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the acid solution; an excellent HER performance (2H(+) + 2e(-) -> H-2) and Tafel slope (40 mV dec(-1)) as well as durability over a period of 50 h were achieved. Theoretical calculations showed that the Co2P, WC, and NpyridinicC dopants in the material synergistically promoted the HER activity rather than the individual constituents. Furthermore, Co2P/WC@NC nano-heterojunctions showed good HER performance in the whole pH range of electrolytes and considerable durability in acidic media containing transition metal ions, which may attract more attention for the exploration and optimization of nano-heterojunction catalysts for the HER.									59	3	0	0	3	0	59			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000428315300011	29292866	
J	Liu, Yuchuan; Hu, Xiang; Huang, Baobing; Xie, Zailai								Surface Engineering of Rh Catalysts with N/S-Codoped Carbon Nanosheets toward High-Performance Hydrogen Evolution from Seawater								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				7	23			18835	18843		10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b03720				DEC 2 2019	2019	In this study, rhodium (Rh) nanoparticles modified by N/S-codoped carbon nanosheets were prepared as a high performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) interface electrocatalyst in seawater. Such in situ formed mesoporous graphene-like nanosheets obtained by pyrolysis of guanine sulfate are thin and have a high surface area of 437.1 m(2)/g, which allows homogeneous dispersion of Rh nanoparticles. The Rh catalysts show unexpected electronic asymmetry depending on the intensity of Rh-support interaction. The X-ray photoelectron spectra results indicate that the introduction of sulfur within graphene-like nanosheets can enhance the interaction between Rh nanoparticles and carbon supports, which promotes the electrons to be deviated from Rh and transferred to the interface of Rh and carbon, leading to a novel interface catalyst. Benefiting from the formation of an electron-rich interface, this as-prepared Rh-based interface catalyst exhibits superior HER activity during the whole pH range, very close to the commercial 20% Pt/C even when the loading of Rh is only 0.5 wt %. Even in seawater (pH = 8.32), this electrocatalyst shows high activity and can deliver -15 mA/cm(2) current density for 10 h with good stability. We believe this work may provide a new pathway to design promising electrocatalysts for seawater splitting.									27	3	0	0	0	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000500650400011

We aim to investigate the abundances of light deuterium-bearing species such as HD, H2D+, and D2H+ in a gas-grain chemical model that includes an extensive description of deuterium and spin-state chemistry, in physical conditions appropriate to the very centers of starless cores.Methods. We combined a gas-grain chemical model with radiative transfer calculations to simulate density and temperature structure in starless cores. The chemical model includes new reaction sets for both gas phase and grain surface chemistry, including deuterated forms of species with up to four atoms and the spin states of the light species H-2, H-2(+), and H-3(+) and their deuterated forms.Results. We find that in the dense and cold environments attributed to the centers of starless cores, HD eventually depletes from the gas phase because deuterium is efficiently incorporated into grain-surface HDO, resulting in inefficient HD production on grains for advanced core ages. HD depletion has consequences not only on the abundances of, e.g., H2D+ and D2H+, whose production depends on the abundance of HD, but also on the spin state abundance ratios of the various light species, when compared with the complete depletion model where heavy elements do not influence the chemistry.Conclusions. While the eventual HD depletion leads to the disappearance of light deuterium-bearing species from the gas phase on a relatively short timescale at high density, we find that at late stages of core evolution, the abundances of H2D+ and D2H+ increase toward the core edge, and the distributions become extended. The HD depletion timescale increases if less oxygen is initially present in the gas phase, owing to chemical interaction between the gas and the dust preceding the starless core phase. Our results are greatly affected if H-2 is allowed to tunnel on grain surfaces, and therefore more experimental data is needed not only on tunneling but also on the O + H-2 surface reaction in particular.									46	1	0	0	0	0	46			0004-6361			WOS:000320444200091		
J	Costentin, Cyrille; Saveant, Jean-Michel								Heterogeneous Molecular Catalysis of Electrochemical Reactions: Volcano Plots and Catalytic Tafel Plots								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				9	23			19894	19899		10.1021/acsami.7b04349				JUN 14 2017	2017	We analyze here, in the framework of heterogeneous molecular catalysis, the reasons for the occurrence or nonoccurrence of volcanoes upon plotting the kinetics of the catalytic reaction versus the stabilization free energy of the primary intermediate of the catalytic process. As in the case of homogeneous molecular catalysis or catalysis by surface-active metallic sites, a strong motivation of such studies relates to modern energy challenges, particularly those involving small molecules, such as water, hydrogen, oxygen, proton, and carbon dioxide. This motivation is particularly pertinent for what concerns heterogeneous molecular catalysis, since it is commonly preferred to homogeneous molecular catalysis by the same molecules if only for chemical separation purposes and electrolytic cell architecture. As with the two other catalysis modes, the main drawback of the volcano plot approach is the basic assumption that the kinetic responses depend on a single descriptor, viz., the stabilization free energy of the primary intermediate. More comprehensive approaches, investigating the responses to the maximal number of experimental factors, and conveniently expressed as catalytic Tafel plots, should clearly be preferred. This is more so in the case of heterogeneous molecular catalysis in that additional transport factors in the supporting film may additionally affect the current potential responses. This is attested by the noteworthy presence of maxima in catalytic Tafel plots as well as their dependence upon the cyclic voltammetric scan rate.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1944-8244			WOS:000403631300060	28530798

Depending upon the T-M cation coordination geometry and the surrounding ligand anions, such inorganic materials may exhibit wide structural diversity and polymorphism. One such family of compounds is disodium metal pyrophosphates (Na2MP2O7), which is formed by a condensation reaction of two inorganic phosphate units. The pyrophosphate (P2O7)(4-) based systems exhibit rich crystal chemistry and play critical role in a wide range of applications such as energy storage, ionic conductivity and near infrared absorption (NIR) depending upon the constituent transition metals. In the present work, we have studied Mn and Co-based pyrophosphates, where we have noticed `phase transformation' depending on the synthesis methods/conditions. Polymorphs of Na2MnP2O7 and Na2CoP2O7 were characterized by diffraction analyses. Their functional properties have been explored by synergizing electrochemical testing methods along with the bond valence site energy (BVSE) modeling to investigate their ionic conductivity, electrocatalytic and electrochemical performance.					63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)63rd DAE Solid State Physics Symposium (DAE-SSPS)	DEC 18-22, 2018DEC 18-22, 2018	Dept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl SciDept Atom Energy; Bhabha Atom Res Ctr; Govt India, Dept Atom Energy, Board Res Nucl Sci	Guru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIAGuru Jambheshwar Univ Sci & Technol, Hisar, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1851-6	WOS:000504650100024

In this study, we have fabricated ultrasmall Ru nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed on S-doped graphene (denoted as Ru/S-rGO) by a facile "one-pot" procedure. The experimental results indicated that both the S doping and moderate degree of oxidization of GO can induce the formation and high dispersion of the ultrasmall Ru NPs with larger electrochemically active surface areas for exposing more active sites. Metal-support interaction between S-doped graphene and Ru NPs was observed from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electronic charge-difference studies. It resulted in the decrease in the electron density of Ru, which facilitated electron release from H2O and H-OH bond breakage. The results of density functional theory calculation confirmed that the S-dopants could reduce the energy barrier for breaking the H-OH bond to accelerate water dissociation during the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a current density 20 mA cm(-2), the lowest overpotential of 14 mV, superior to that of Pt/C in alkaline solution, was observed for Ru/S-rGO-24. The observed lowest value of overpotential was because of the ultrasmall size, high dispersion, and metal-support interaction. This work provides a simple and effective method in designing advanced electrocatalysts for the HER in an alkaline electrolyte.									37	3	0	0	1	0	37			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000586868400035	33073562

The effect of phosphate variation is studied via preparing thin films with different nickel and phosphate molar weight ratio, as decreasing phosphate concentration in the reaction bath willow leaf like morphology changes to compact microflower with rectangular petals. As-prepared Ni2P2O7 center dot 8H(2)O at a molar weight ratio of 1:2 (nickel: phosphate) gives better results as an electrocatalyst with low overpotential of 308 mV at 25 mA cm(-2) current density, as compare to other molar weight ratios (1:1 and 1:0.5). This excellent electrocatalytic performance of hydrous nickel pyrophosphate thin film electrodes is credited to high ECSA and low impedance of electrocatalyst.

Titanium oxide and manganese oxide complexes have high potential as components of a cheap, nontoxic, and stable photocatalyst. In this theoretical work, the water oxidation process on MnxTi2-xO4 (x = 0-2) dusters is investigated at the BP86 level of theory using two water molecules and fully saturated systems. In the oxidation cycle using two water molecules, Mn reduces the reaction energy; however, Mn does not reduce the reaction energy on the fully saturated system. When two water molecules are used, the highest reaction energy in the water oxidation cycle is lower than 3 eV, but the highest reaction energy is higher than 3 eV on fully saturated systems except for the pure titanium oxide complex which has a highest reaction energy of 2.56 eV. Dehydrogenation processes in the water oxidation cycle require higher energy than the O-O formation or water adsorption processes. The overall dehydrogenation energy is usually smaller on complexes including at least one Mn atom and it is smallest on the Mn2O4 complex that has two water molecules. Considering the highest reaction energy in the overall water oxidation cycle, water oxidation at the manganese atom of MnTiO4 hydrated with two water molecules is the most favorable in energy.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1089-5639			WOS:000342119000022	24673718

Transcriptional responses to hypoxia are enhanced by recurrent hypoxia (hypoxic preconditioning) in the epaulette shark. Physiol Genomics 44: 1090-1097, 2012. First published September 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00081.2012.-All animals require molecular oxygen for aerobic energy production, and oxygen availability has played a particularly important role in the evolution of aquatic animals. This study investigates how previous exposure to hypoxia (preconditioning) primes protective transcriptional responses in a hypoxia-tolerant vertebrate species, the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum). The epaulette shark is a basal cartilaginous fish that in its natural environment experiences cyclic hypoxic periods. We evaluated whether the transcription of a set of crucial prosurvival genes is affected differently by a single short-term (2 h) exposure to sublethal hypoxia compared with eight such successive hypoxia exposures (hypoxia preconditioning). We discovered that hypoxia preconditioning amplifies transcriptional responses compared with animals that experienced a single hypoxic bout. In the heart we observed that hypoxic preconditioning, but not a single hypoxic exposure, resulted in higher transcript levels of genes that regulate oxygen and energy homeostasis, including those of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, adenosine signaling pathway components, and genes affecting circulation [prostaglandin synthetase 2 (cox-2) and natriuretic peptide C]. This suggests that in a single short-term hypoxic bout, the responses to low oxygen are regulated at the level of pre-existing proteins or translational and posttranslational machinery, whereas transcriptional responses are induced in experiments that parallel the natural environmental cycles of oxygen availability. These findings have general implications for understanding how vertebrates regulate protective gene expression upon physiological stress.									15	0	0	0	15	1	15			1094-8341			WOS:000311232200002	22991209

It was found that Ni2P QDs with the size of 4-6 nm highly loaded on NCN surface; moreover, the N-Ni bond was formed, photoinduced electrons are easy to transfer from N to Ni2P, promoting the effective separation of photoinduced charges. When it is used as a catalyst for water splitting to produce H-2, hydrogen evolution rate can be up to 2189.22 mu mol (h g)(-1), which is obviously superior to NCN and sample prepared by physical mixing phosphorization methods. Furthermore, excellent steady performance could be kept. Evidently, current work provides an effective method for modifying photocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000749425000005

Identifying the metabolic pathways that are altered early with viral infection and their association with disease severity is crucial to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology, and guide clinical decisions. This study aimed at assessing the critical metabolic pathways altered with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Forty-nine hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in a prospective, observational, single-center study in Barcelona, Spain. Demographic, clinical, and analytical data at admission were registered. Plasma samples were collected within the first 48 h following hospitalization. Patients were stratified based on the severity of their evolution as moderate (N = 13), severe (N = 10), or critical (N = 26). A panel of 221 biomarkers was measured by targeted metabolomics in order to evaluate metabolic changes associated with subsequent disease severity. Our results show that obesity, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, as well as some analytical parameters and radiological findings, were all associated with disease severity. Additionally, ceramide metabolism, tryptophan degradation, and reductions in several metabolic reactions involving nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) at inclusion were significantly associated with respiratory severity and correlated with inflammation.

In view of the low H2O abundance in the present atmosphere, several studies suggest that the planet should have lost most of its H2O during the early high X-ray, EUV and solar wind period of the active young Sun. Because oxygen did not accumulate in Venus' atmosphere it is commonly believed that a part of the oxygen from dissociated H2O vapor was dragged off to space along with the escaping hydrogen during a blow-off period, or could have oxidized the surface minerals to produce FeO and Fe2O3 to the depths of a few kilometers to tens of kilometers depending on the initial amount of H2O. We use in the present study, for the first time, multi-wavelength X-ray and EUV (XUV) observations by the ASCA, ROSAT, EUVE, FUSE and IUE satellites and stellar winds inferred from mass loss observations by the Hubble Space Telescope of solar proxies with ages < 4.6 Gyr for the investigation of how efficiently the radiation and particle environment of the young Sun could have influenced the evolution of the early Venusian atmosphere and its H2O inventory due to the removal of oxygen picked up by the solar wind. For modelling the Venusian thermosphere over the planetary history we apply a diffusive-gravitational equilibrium and thermal balance model and investigate the heating of the early thermosphere by photodissociation and ionization processes, due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by CO2 IR emission in the 15 mu m band. Our model simulations result in expanded thermospheres with exobase levels between about 200 km at present and about 2200 km 4.5 Gyr ago. Moreover, our results yield high exospheric temperatures during the active phase of the young Sun even if we assume a "dry" CO2 atmosphere with similar composition that is observed on present Venus of more than 8000 K after the Sun arrived at the zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS). Exospheric temperatures above about 4000 K lead to diffusion-limited escape and high loss rates for atomic hydrogen. The duration of this blow-off phase for atomic hydrogen essentially depends on the mixing ratios of CO2, N-2 and H2O in the early Venusian atmosphere and could last between about 150 to several hundred Myr, which could result in a large thermal loss of hydrogen from Venus. For studying how much of the H2O-related oxygen could have been lost to space by the ion pick up process due to the stronger solar wind and higher XUV fluxes of the young Sun we used our modelled atmospheric density profiles and studied the loss of O+ ion pick up from the upper atmosphere of Venus over the planet's history by applying a numerical test particle model. Depending on the used solar wind parameters, our model simulations show that ion pick up by a strong early solar wind on a non-magnetized Venus could erode during 4.6 Gyr more than about 250 bar of O+ ions, that corresponds to an equivalent amount of one terrestrial ocean.Finally, wediscuss the implications of our findings for the formation of the Venusian atmosphere and discuss our results in the frame of previous studies.

Sulfide phases such as these may be isolated from a silicate melt along with other crystallizing phases during the evolution of arc magma, and partition coefficients are required to model the effect of this process on molybdenum and tungsten budgets.We developed an experimental design to take advantage of properties of the phases under study. Careful control of temperature allowed pyrrhotite and magnetite to be stable along with an Fe-S-O melt, and this phase assemblage allowed the composition of run-product pyrrhotite to be used to calculate both fS(2) and fO(2) for the experiments. At run temperature, (1042 +/- 2 degrees C), a rhyolitic melt can be formed at low pressure, under nominally dry conditions, which removed the need for confining pressure as well as externally imposed fugacities. The silica-saturated melt allowed the charges to be contained in sealed evacuated silica tubes without danger of reaction, and with closed system behavior for molybdenum and tungsten.Experiments were run for durations up to 2000 min. Molybdenite (mb) and wolframite (wo) were added to the experiments as sources for molybdenum and tungsten, respectively. Manganese was added to the system as both a component of the starting rhyolitic pumice, and of Mn-bearing wolframite. Oxygen fugacity in these experiments was fixed at the Ni-NiO oxygen fugacity buffer. Sulfur fugacity was 10(-1) bar. Run products were analyzed by EPMA and LA-ICP-MS. Analysis of the run products yielded (D-i(a/b) +/- 1 sigma(X) over bar standard deviation of the mean): D-Mo(Fe-S-O/Si-melt) = 90 +/- 10, D-W(Fe-S-O/Si-melt) = 9 +/- 3, D-Mo(po/Si-melt) = 35 +/- 3, and D-Mn(po/Si-melt) = 0.0012 +/- 0.0006. The partition coefficients for manganese in this system are D-Mn(Fe-S-O/Si-melt) 2.9 +/- 0.3 and D-Mn(po/Si-melt) = 1.1 +/- 0.1.Simple Rayleigh fractionation modeling suggests that oxidized felsic melts produced through fractional crystallization may have lost as much as 14% of their initial molybdenum, but only 2% of their initial tungsten, through the removal of an Fe-S-O melt along with crystalline phases. Modeling consistent with conditions of oxygen and sulfur fugacity influenced by assimilation of sulfide (with low concentrations of molybdenum and tungsten) from, for example, sedimentary rock, results in evolved magmas significantly depleted in molybdenum, but only moderately depleted in tungsten. The molybdenum: tungsten ratio can vary by two orders of magnitude. These systematics may help to explain some of the variability in metal ratios of intrusion-related hydrothermal ore deposits.

The synthesized nanocomposite was characterized by SEM, XRD, EDX, UV-vis spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption, photocurrent response and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The superior contact between three materials in the nanocomposite facilitates the photocatalytic degradation of phenol and evolution of oxygen. The cause of the enhanced photocatalytic performance could ascribe to the highly facilitated electron transport by the synergistic effect between three materials, as well as suppressing the electron hole pair recombination in the nanocomposite.

For both systems, four analogous redox states were detected, with the formation of Ir(4+)-Ir(5+)being the potential-determining step in both cases. However, the two systems exhibit distinct water oxidation reaction kinetics, withpotential-independentfirst-order kinetics forIrMolecularcontrasting with potential-dependent kinetics forIrOx. This is attributed towater oxidation on the heterogeneous catalyst requiring co-operative effects between neighboring oxidized Ir centers. The ability ofIrMolecularto drive water oxidation without such co-operative effects is explained by the specific coordination environment around itsIr centers. These distinctions between molecular and heterogeneous reaction kinetics are shown to explain the differences observedin their water oxidation electrocatalytic performance under different potential conditions									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000804699500008	35511107

Here, we report two kinds of one-dimensional (1D) ultrafine PtCu nanowires (smooth surface & rugged surface) synthesized via a wet chemical method and their distinct catalytic performances in electro-oxidation of alcohols. The alloyed PtCu nanowires having rough surfaces with atomic steps exhibit superior catalytic activity toward multiple electrochemical reactions compared with the smooth counterpart. Density functional theory simulations show the excellent reactivity of rugged PtCu na-nowires and attribute it to the surface synergetic Pt-Cu site which accounts for the promotion of water dissociation and the dehydrogenation of the carboxyl intermediate. The current study provides an insight into reasonable design of alloy nanocatalysts in energy-related electrocatalytic systems.									13	1	0	0	0	0	12			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000582106400001

However, nanostructured g-C3N4 photocatalysts synthesized by traditional thermal polycondensation methods have the disadvantage of small specific surface areas and wide band gaps; these limit the catalytic activity and application range of g-C3N4. Based on the unique nanostructure of g-C3N4, it is a feasible method to modify g-C3N4 with metals to design novel metal-semiconductor composites. Metals alter the photochemical properties of g-C3N4, in particular, narrow the band gap and expand photoabsorption into the visible range, which improves the photocatalytic performance. This review covers recent progress in metal/g-C3N4 nanocomposites for photocatalysts, organic systems, biosensors, and so on. The aim is to summarize the synthetic methods, nanostructures, and applications of metal/g-C3N4 nanocomposite materials, as well as discuss future research directions in these areas.									72	1	0	0	7	0	72			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000392511400002	27717173

Immersion								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				168	1					011502	10.1149/1945-7111/abdb4a				JAN 1 2021	2021	With the aim to open a new window into corrosion processes this paper presents respirometric methods for real-time in situ monitoring of corrosion rates under immersion conditions. With these techniques, sensitive, non-destructive corrosion rate measurements are possible on basically all metals and alloys. Different methods are presented that enable to monitor HER, ORR or both reactions simultaneously based on the amount of evolved H-2 or the amount of consumed O-2 by volumetric, manometric and sensor-based approaches. Various research examples are presented, demonstrating the benefits and limitations of the different approaches. For Mg alloys, besides HER, ORR plays a role in the cathodic reactions and a good correlation of the total cathodic charge with mass loss was obtained. H-2 dissolution into the electrolyte was identified as an important factor. The results obtained for Zn immersion corrosion in intermittent-flow and flow-through respirometric experiments suggest that the ORR mechanism leads to the generation of stable H2O2 under these conditions. As a result, the effective number of exchanged electrons for one O-2 molecule was found to be in between two and four. The here introduced respirometric techniques allow new insights into corrosion mechanisms, in addition to enabling real-time monitoring of corrosion.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000612844300001

During the postdeposition annealing (PDA) of the Al2O3/HfO2/GaAs structures at 700 degrees C, large amounts of Ga oxides were generated between the Al2O3 and HfO2 films as the result of interfacial reactions between interdiffused oxygen impurities and out-diffused atomic Ga. However, in the case of the HfO2/Al2O3/GaAs structures, the presence of an Al2O3 buffer layer effectively blocked the out-diffusion of atomic Ga, thus suppressing the formation of Ga oxide. Microstructural analyses showed that HfO2 films that were deposited on Al2O3/GaAs had completely crystallized during the PDA process, even at 700 degrees C, because of the Al2O3 diffusion barrier. Capacitance-voltage measurements showed a relatively large frequency dispersion of the Al2O3/HfO2/GaAs structure in accumulation capacitance compared to the HfO2/Al2O3/GaAs structure due to a higher interface state density. Conductance results revealed that the Al2O3 buffer layer on GaAs resulted in a significant reduction in gap states in GaAs. The induced gap state in the Al2O3/HfO2/GaAs structure originated from the out-diffusion of atomic Ga into the HfO2 film. Density functional theory calculations supported this conclusion.									31	0	0	0	3	0	31			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000317031900017	23438318

The oxygen coupling is examined starting from some known inorganic complexes of manganese. Idealized geometries of four binuclear complexes (two di-mu-oxo, one tri-mu-oxo and one mu-carboxylato-di-mu-oxo) are distorted to transform into O2-bound complexes. The computed Walsh diagrams are analyzed. For these structures the predicted oxidation to dioxygen is energetically unfavorable and would require two two-electron steps forming bound peroxide as an intermediate. An in-plane approach of two oxo ligands has a lower barrier for peroxide bond formation. Four tetranuclear Mn clusters are built combining binuclear complexes, a Mn4O4 cubane-like core, three (Mn2O2)2(mu-O2) "dimer of dimers' cores with mu-4,eta-2-O2 bound either in or out of the Mn4 plane formed by two parallel Mn2O2 units, and a "planar T" combination of two orthogonal Mn2O2 units with a Mn3O2 core and mu-3,eta-2-O2 bound to three Mn atoms. The assumed pathway leading to peroxide bond formation in each of these is found to have appreciably lower energy for the (Mn2O2)2(mu-O2) and the 'planar T" models with in-plane O-O approach. A slight energetic advantage is calculated in the peroxide to dioxygen step when the oxo ligands are coordinated to at least three Mn ions compared to coordination to only two Mn ions. Qualitative valence bond analysis indicates that release of symmetrically coordinated dioxygen, as in cis- and trans-mu-O2, requires overcoming an approximately 1-eV electronic barrier for formation of ground-state O2 (triplet). The tetranuclear models are introduced into speculative mechanisms and compared with current knowledge of the photosynthetic water oxidation reaction.									75	0	0	0	13	0	75			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:A1992HV67500052

The structural genes encoding the four subunits of this HiPIP:oxygen oxidoreductase were cloned and sequenced. The genes for subunits II, I, III, and IV (named rcoxA to rcoxD) are found in this order and seemed to be organized in an operon of at least five genes with a terminator structure a few nucleotides downstream of rcoxD. Examination of the amino acid sequence of the Rcox subunits shows that the subunits of the R. marinus enzyme have homology to the corresponding subunits of oxidases belonging to the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases, RcoxB has the conserved histidines involved in binding the binuclear center and the low-spin heme, All of the residues proposed to be involved in proton transfer channels are conserved, with the exception of the key glutamate residue of the D-channel (E-278, Paracoccus denitrificans numbering). Analysis of the homology-derived structural model of subunit I shows that the phenol group of a tyrosine (Y) residue and the hydroxyl group of the following serine (S) may functionally substitute the glutamate carboxyl in proton transfer. RcoxA has an additional sequence for heme C binding, after the Cu-A domain, that is characteristic of caa(3) oxidases belonging to the superfamily, Homology modeling of the structure of this cytochrome domain of subunit II shows no marked electrostatic character, especially around the heme edge region, suggesting that the interaction with a redox partner is not of an electrostatic nature. This observation is analyzed in relation to the electron donor for this caa, oxidase, the HiPIP. In conclusion, it is shown that an oxidase, which uses an iron-sulfur protein as an electron donor, is structurally related to the caa, class of heme-copper cytochrome c oxidases. The data are discussed in the framework of the evolution of oxidases within the superfamily of heme-copper oxidases.									33	0	0	0	31	0	33			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000166121500032	11133964

To study this phenomenon, a single particle of aluminum titanate is dissolved in slag at 1773 K. During the dissolution process, gas bubble evolution is observed. Further, the particle-slag system is rapidly quenched using helium at different stages of dissolution. The quenched samples are examined for distribution of the constituent elements: Al, Ti, Ca, and Si using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). Phases such as alumina, titanium-rich slag, and calcium titanate are detected at the particle-slag interface. The dissolution path of aluminum titanate is proposed in the following steps. First, aluminum titanate dissociates into alumina, titanium oxide, and oxygen while slag penetrates through the particle. In the next step, the alumina and titanium oxide dissolve in slag, and the oxygen leaves the system. The existence of gas bubbles enhances the overall rate of Al2TiO5 dissolution. The dissolution of Al2TiO5 appears to be controlled by mass transfer in the slag. Evidence in support of this finding is the particle-slag interface characterization by line scan analysis and calculated diffusivity values being inversely proportional to the viscosity of slag.									6	1	0	0	0	0	7			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000518502400016

However, high defect density stemmed from long high-temperature ammonolysis limits the separation and transfer efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers in BaTaO2N. Here, a NH3 delivery system is specifically localized just above the synthesis mixture to reduce the synthesis time and defect density of BaTaO2N by a fresh supply of more active nitriding species and minimizing the generation of N-2 and H-2. Particularly, the effects of synthesis temperature (700-950 degrees C), synthesis time (1-8 h), and gas composition are systematically investigated to gain insights into the formation of single-phase BaTaO2N by solid-state reaction and flux method. Time-dependent experiments conducted at 950 degrees C show that single-phase BaTaO2N can be synthesized >= 6 and >= 4 h by solid-state reaction and flux method, respectively, revealing the advantage of the flux method over solid-state reaction in a localized NH3 delivery system. Subsequently, the separation and transfer efficiency and kinetics of photogenerated charge carriers are studied in BaTaO2N samples. Photoelectrochemical studies made it possible to resolve trends during visible-light-induced water oxidation, evidencing the inverse relationship between recombination and charge transfer phenomena. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that the dynamics of the photogenerated charge carriers in both types of BaTaO2N samples are different: (i) BaTaO2N synthesized by flux method has a greater number of holes despite the similar number of deeply trapped charge carriers and (ii) solid-state reaction led to the formation of a higher number of free electrons in BaTaO2N. The findings demonstrate the advantage of reducing the transfer distance of active nitriding species to the surface of the synthesis mixture for enhancing the photoelectrochemical water oxidation of BaTaO2N at neutral pH.									5	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600065

In particular, the large electrochemical overpotential required to drive the water oxidation is known as a major drawback. This overpotential (0.4 - 0.6 V anodic of the flat band potential) has been attributed to poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis and to charge trapping in surface states but is still not fully understood. In the present study, we quantitatively investigate the photocurrent and photovoltage transient behavior of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes prepared by atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition, under light bias, in a standard electrolyte, and one containing a sacrificial agent. The accumulation of positive charges occurring in water at low bias potential is found to be maximum when the photocurrent onsets. The transient photocurrent behavior of a standard photoanode is compared to photoanodes modified by either a catalytic or surface passivating overlayer. Surface modification shows a reduction and a cathodic shift of the charge accumulation, following the observed change in photocurrent onset. By applying an electrochemical model, the values of the space charge width (5-10 nm) and of the hole diffusion length (0.5-1.5 nm) are extracted from photocurrent transients' amplitudes with the sacrificial agent. Characterization of the photovoltage transients also suggests the presence of surface states causing Fermi level pinning at small applied potential. The transient photovoltage and the use of both overlayers on the same electrode enable differentiation of the two overlayers' effects and a simplified model is proposed to explain the roles of each overlayer and their synergetic effects. This investigation demonstrates a new method to characterize water splitting photoelectrodes-especially the charge accumulation occurring at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface during operation. It finally confirms the requirements of nanostructuring and surface control with catalytic and trap passivation layers to improve iron oxide's performance for water photolysis.									254	3	0	0	15	0	254			1932-7447			WOS:000312681500004

Materials with low-crystal symmetry structures demonstrate facet-dependent properties due to asymmetric coordination, and facet engineering can modulate PEC properties. In this regard, different facets [e.g., (002), (121), and (040)] of the monoclinic-scheelite polymorph of BiVO4 (low-crystal symmetry structure) have been grown by controlling the thickness (deposition time) of thin films [22 nm (10 s) to 265 nm (50 s)] by the electron beam deposition technique. X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis suggest the presence of different exposed planes that display different EC and PEC activity. PEC water splitting measurements suggest that the 110 nm/30 s thin-film sample, that is, the (040) facet, has the highest current density, that is, 0.29 mA/cm(2) (under light) and 0.068 mA/cm(2) (under dark) at 1.8 V versus RHE. However, the applied bias photon to current efficiencies (ABPEs) of both the thin films, that is, (040)/30 s and (121)/40 s facets, are nearly equal, whereas (121)/40 s has enhanced electrical and solar power-to-hydrogen (ESPH) conversion efficiencies compared to the (040)/30 s facet sample. Band edge positions computed via density functional simulations of exposed surfaces suggest that different facets have different band edge positions, thereby offering different driving forces to perform oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The relation between efficiency (ABPE and ESPH) and driving force suggests that the enhanced PEC performance of the (040) facet of BiVO4 is due to the increased driving force to perform OER, whereas the improved efficiency of (121)/40 s can be due to enhanced surface catalytic activity. The highest catalytic activity of the (040)/30 s sample is due to low electron-hole recombination in the bulk and maximum charge injection at the surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000858584600001

Electrocatalytic properties of electrodeposited black ruthenium in acidic and basic media for hydrogen production via water electrolysis								TENCON 2012 - 2012 IEEE Region 10 Conference								6 pp.	6 pp.		10.1109/TENCON.2012.6412334				2012	2012	The study aims to determine the feasibility of using electrodeposited black ruthenium on gold-coated silver as a possible substitute electrode to platinum in industrial water electrolysis. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry were employed to characterize the electrochemical behavior and compare the electrocatalytic properties of Ru black and Pt in acidic (0.5M H2SO4) and basic (0.5M NaOH) media. The results of cyclic voltammetry show that Ru black exhibits anodic corrosion/dissolution coupled with oxygen evolution in acidic and basic media consistent with its Pourbaix diagram. Hence, it cannot be used as an anode in water electrolysis. Ru black however is a promising cathode in both media with overpotential (~0.1V in acid and ~0.4V in alkaline), and exchange current density, io, in the order of 10-3 comparable to that obtained for Pt. Stability tests in acidic and alkaline media reveal cracking in the Ru black electrode possibly due to hydrogen adsorption in the metal lattice inducing strain. More intense cracking observed in the stability test in acidic media is attributed to the presence of sulfur, a hydrogen recombination poison, resulting in more hydrogen to get absorbed into the metal lattice. Hence, despite excellent electrocatalytic properties of Ru black, it faces reliability issues in long term water electrolysis.

As we all know, bimetallic hybrids have been emerged as one type of outstanding electrocatalysts and applied to electrochemical hydrogen generation field. In this work, using bimetallic polyoxometalates (POM) as soft templates and polyethyleneimine (PEI) as carbon source, we synthesized cobalt and tungsten-based bimetallic electrocatalysts (Co/WC@NC) via one-step simple high temperature calcination process. Co/WC@NC exhibits good hydrogen evolution performances. Thereinto, the overpotentials are 129 and 142 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), and the Tafel slopes are 93 and 91 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH aqueous solutions, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst shows good stability for 24 h. The excellent catalytic performance (Co/WC@NC) can be ascribed to the synergistic effect of WC and Co nanoparticles and the protection function of graphitic carbon layers. Furthermore, this work may provide an experimental guidance for the large-scale production of low-cost materials with good catalytic effects.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000666962200001	34087812

The platinum film on titanium (Ti/Pt) was prepared by thermal decomposition of an alcoholic solution of Pt. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and elemental mapping were used to characterize the surfaces of Ti/Pt, Ti/SnO2-Sb, and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. The electrochemical characterization of the electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The electroactive area of the electrodes was determined using measurements of the electrosorption hydrogen charge for Ti/Pt and the capacitance of the electric double layer for Ti/SnO2-Sb and Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb. Tafel slopes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were estimated from polarization curves. The SEM and EDS results obtained from the electrodes prepared with or without a platinum interlayer displayed distinct behaviors. In the absence of Pt, the SnO2-Sb coating on titanium formed a compact layer with a good distribution of Sn, Sb, O, and a low Ti content. In the presence of the Pt coating, SnO2-Sb was heterogeneously distributed. The heterogeneous character of the Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb film resulted from surface segregation during the calcination process. The voltammetric behaviors of the SnO2-Sb electrodes prepared with or without a Pt interlayer displayed similar trends, although the presence of Pt produced a greater electroactive area and shifted the oxygen evolution potential toward less positive values; therefore, the electrocatalytic activity toward the OER was higher compared to the Ti/SnO2-Sb electrode. The Tafel slope estimated for Ti/Pt/SnO2-Sb is consistent with a mechanism in which OH center dot generation is the rate controlling step.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000477867100023

The findings indicate that in the macroscopic aspects, the unloaded coal under different initial stresses is easier to oxidize than the raw coal sample. The CO production-strain curve of the experimental coal samples is similar to the axial stress-strain curve; when the initial stress reaches 25 MPa, the coal sample is in the stage of strain softening and the oxidation capacity of coal sample is the strongest. The infrared spectra of FTIR are analyzed, and the dynamic changes characteristics of microactive groups such as aromatic hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, and oxygen-containing functional groups under different initial stress are mastered. The microscopic spontaneous combustion mechanism of unloading coal under different stress is obtained.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000471438000001

However, the discharge of a large amount of FA-containing wastewater poses a serious threat to the environment and human health. Recently, the in-situ hydrogen energy release technology of hydrogen-containing stable liquid has been extensively explored due to its safe storage. Exploring a robust method to achieve FA removal and synchronous in-situ hydrogen release from FA containing wastewater is of great significant for environmental protection and energy crisis alleviation. Here, we have innovatively introduced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation technology into FA removal and hydrogen production simultaneously. The composite of nitrogen doped carbon coating Co 9 S 8 nanotubes (Co 9 S 8 @N ???C) is employed as a proof of concept for FA decomposition and simultaneously hydrogen production based on PMS activation system. As expected, the Co 9 S 8 @N ???C/PMS system presents much superior hydrogen production efficiency and satisfactory FA removal rate towards FA wastewater than those of common catalysis, photocatalysis and Fenton reaction in the basic condition in a wide range of FA concentration. The hydrogen yield reaches a value as high as 471 ??mol within 60 min, corresponding to a FA degradation rate of 30% with an initial FA concentration of 0.722 mol L ???1 . Characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the free radical process dominated by superoxide radical (O 2 ??????) and nonradical process dominated by singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ), which are induced by Co 9 S 8 @N ???C/PMS system, are responsible for highly efficient hydrogen production via FA degradation. These generated O 2 ??????and 1 O 2 can extract ???H from FA to form ???OOH intermediate, which can further combine with the ???H from water to produce hydrogen. This study provides an applicable technique for environmental purification and new energy development based on FA containing wastewater. ?? 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1005-0302	1941-1162		WOS:000830890200001

Herein, we report the photocombustion developed to dramatically reduce the crystallization temperature of a sol-gel VO2 film from 600 to 250 degrees C by combining deep ultraviolet irradiation with a carbon-free oxidizer for reactive radical generation. The morphological transition and crystal evolution of the sol-gel films annealed via various conditions including combustion, photoactivation, and photocombustion were thoroughly investigated using in situ and ex situ TEM techniques, allowing us to separate the regimes of amorphous and crystal solid formation. TGA-DTA, UV-vis spectroscopy, and EDX analyses reveal that, at [AN]/[VO(acac)(2)] of 1.5, impurity removal and V-O-V polycondensation are most effective and suggest that oxygen vacancies generated during reduction play a key role in accelerating crystallization. Functional VO2 films were successfully deposited on polyimide substrates for large-area flexible phase-transition device arrays, while their excellent uniformity and phase-transition reliability were confirmed under various bending conditions. We believe that the low-temperature crystallization via DUV-assisted photocombustion is useful for strain-sensitive low temperature devices of crystalline metal oxide films fabricated via sol-gel routes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000535241800036

The compounds were synthesized by topotactic reduction with H-2/N-2 (5/95) at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C. Above 800 degrees C the Fe/Mo ratio changes from Fe/Mo = 2-1 < Fe/Mo < 2. The structural refinements of the XRPD data for the reduced perovskites were carried out by the Rietveld profile analysis method. The crystal structure of these phases is cubic, space group Fm (3) over barm, with cationic disorder at the two different B sites that can be populated in variable proportions by the Fe atoms. The Mossbauer spectra allowed determining the evolution of the different species formed after the treatments at different temperatures and confirm that Fe ions in the samples reduced at 600, 700 and 800 degrees C are only in the high-spin Fe3+ electronic state.

Fresh kimberlite rocks are exceptionally rare, as most of them are invariably modified by pervasive deuteric and/or post-magmatic fluids that overprint the original mineralogy. In this study, we examined fresh archetypal kimberlite from the Mark pipe (Lac de Gras, Canada), which is characterised by well-preserved olivine and groundmass minerals. The sequence of crystallisation of the parental melt and its major compositional features, including oxygen fugacity, were reconstructed using textural relationships between magmatic minerals, their zoning patterns and crystal/melt/fluid inclusions. Crystal and multiphase primary, pseudosecondary and secondary melt/fluid inclusions in olivine, Cr-diopside, spinet, perovskite, phlogopite/kinoshitalite, apatite and calcite preserve a record of different stages of kimberlite melt evolution. Melt/fluid inclusions are generally more depleted in silica and more enriched in alkalis (K, Na), alkali-earth (Ba, Sr) and halogens (Cl, F) relative to the whole-rock composition of the Mark kimberlite. These melt/fluid inclusion compositions, in combination with presence of elevated CaO (up to 1.73 wt%), in Mg-rich olivine rinds, crystallisation of groundmass kinoshitalite, carbonates (calcite, Sr-Ba-bearing) and alkali-enriched rims around apatite suggest that there was progressive enrichment in CO2, alkalis and halogens in the evolving parental melt.The Mark kimberlite groundmass is characterised by the following stages of in-situ crystallisation: (1) olivine rims around xenocrystic cores + Cr-spinel/TIMAC. (2) Mg-rich olivine rinds around olivine rims/cores + MUM-spinel (followed by pleonaste and Mg-magnetite) + monticellite ( + partial resorption of olivine, along with the formation of ferropericlase and CO2 as a result of decarbonation reactions) + perovskite + apatite. (3) Olivine outmost rinds, which are coeval with phlogopite/kinoshitalite + apatite + sulphides + carbonate (calcite, Ba-Sr-Na-bearing varieties). In addition, oxygen fugacity of the Mark kimberlite was constrained by olivine-chromite, perovskite and monticellite oxygen barometry and showed that the parental melt became progressively more oxidised in response to fractional crystallisation. (4) Deuteric (i.e. late-stage magmatic) and/or post-magmatic (i.e. external fluids) alteration of magmatic minerals (e.g., olivine, monticellite, ferropericlase) and crystallisation of mesostasis serpentine. K-bearing chlorite and brudte (i.e. replacement of ferroperidase). The absence of any alkali (Na, K) and halogen (F, Cl) rich groundmass minerals in the Mark kimberlite may be attributed to these elements becoming concentrated in the late-stage melt where they potentially formed unstable, water-soluble carbonates (such as those observed in melt inclusions). Consequently, these minerals were most likely removed from the groundmass by deuteric and/or post-magmatic alteration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

To improve the electrocatalytic performance and stability of PbO2 electrode, a Co-PEG-PbO2 electrode modified by Co2+ ion and polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) was prepared by polystyrene microspheres assisted electrodeposition combined with surface structure adjustment and active substance doping, and used for the effective degradation of p-chlorophenol in water. The results showed that the Co-PEG-PbO2 electrode surface was composed of small spherical particles 13-PbO2, containing a small amount of Co2O3 and PEG, and its grain size (8.985 nm) was the smallest in the same series of electrodes. The electrochemical tests results showed that the oxygen evolution reaction in Na2SO4 solution was a sequential two-step charge transfer process, which was controlled by charge transfer and diffusion. The electrode had smaller oxygen evolution potential (1.40 V), larger exchange current density (j(0) = 1.164 x 10(-4) mA.cm(-2)), smaller charge transfer resistance (0.8778 Omega.cm(2)) and larger concentration polarization resistance (1.335 Cd.cm(2)), indicating that the Co-PEG-PbO2 electrode had better electrocatalytic performance. The degradation of p-chlorophenol was controlled by diffusion and was oxidized by strong oxidizing .OH, which conforms to CE mechanism. Within the same degradation time, the electrode had a higher p-chlorophenol removal efficiency q (97.34%), higher TOC removal efficiency (64.25%), higher mineralization current efficiency (23.45%), and lower cell voltage. The accelerated life test showed that Co-PEG-PbO2 electrode had the longest service life (280 min), which was 2.8, 1.8 and 2 times of PbO2 electrode, Co-PbO2 electrode and PEG-PbO2 electrode, respectively. The electrocatalytic activity and stability of PbO2 electrode can be effectively improved by structural adjustment and co-doping with Co2+ and PEG, which can be used for the effective degradation of p-chlorophenol.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1383-5866	1873-3794		WOS:000707573800001

However, it is still unclear whether iron cycling in the water column or during diagenesis represents the major control on the iron isotope composition of sediments and sedimentary rocks. Interpretation of isotopic data in terms of oceanic redox conditions is only possible if water column processes dominate the isotopic composition, whereas redox interpretations are less straightforward if diagenetic iron cycling controls the isotopic composition. In the latter scenario, iron isotope data is more directly related to microbial processes such as dissimilatory iron reduction. Here we present bulk rock iron isotope data from late Proterozoic marine shales from Svalbard, northwestern Canada, and Siberia, to better understand the controls on iron isotope fractionation in late Proterozoic marine environments. Bulk shales span a delta Fe-56 range from -0.45% to + 1.04%. Although delta Fe-56 values show significant variation within individual stratigraphic units, their mean value is closer to that of bulk crust and hydrothermal iron in samples post-dating the ca. 717-660 Ma Sturtian glaciation compared to older samples. After correcting for the highly reactive iron content in our samples based on iron speciation data, more than 90% of the calculated delta Fe-56 compositions of highly reactive iron falls in the range from ca. -0.8% to + 3%. An isotope mass-balance model indicates that diagenetic iron cycling can only change the isotopic composition of highly reactive iron by < 1%, suggesting that water column processes, namely the degree of oxidation of the ferrous seawater iron reservoir, control the isotopic composition of highly reactive iron. Considering a long-term decrease in the isotopic composition of the iron source to the dissolved seawater Fe(II) reservoir to be unlikely, we offer two possible explanations for the Neoproterozoic delta Fe-56 trend. First, a decreasing supply of Fe(II) to the ferrous seawater iron reservoir could have caused the reservoir to decrease in size, allowing a higher degree of partial oxidation, irrespective of increasing environmental oxygen levels. Alternatively, increasing oxygen levels would have led to a higher proportion of Fe(II) being oxidized, without decreasing the initial size of the ferrous seawater iron pool. We consider the latter explanation as the most likely. According to this hypothesis, the delta Fe-56 record reflects the redox evolution of Earth's surface environments. delta Fe-56 values in pre-Sturtian samples significantly heavier than bulk crust and hydrothermal iron imply partial oxidation of a ferrous seawater iron reservoir. In contrast, mean delta Fe-56 values closer to that of hydrothermal iron in post-Sturtian shales reflects oxidation of a larger proportion of the ferrous seawater iron reservoir, and by inference, higher environmental oxygen levels. Nevertheless, significant iron isotopic variation in post-Sturtian shales suggest redox heterogeneity and possibly a dominantly anoxic deep ocean, consistent with results from recent studies using iron speciation and redox sensitive trace metals. However, the interpretation of generally increasing environmental oxygen levels after the Sturtian glaciation highlights the need to better understand the sensitivity of different redox proxies to incremental changes in oxygen levels to enable us to reconcile results from different paleoredox proxies.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The associated toxicities of PF-MP might be affected by photoaging. In this study, the dynamic evolutions of the oxidative potential (OP) and redox-active species, including environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxides and conjugated carbonyls, as well as the associated cytotoxicity of PF-MP were systematically investigated as a result of the simulated sunlight irradiation. As the photoaging time extended, the OP of PF-MP increased. The contents of the produced conjugated carbonyls, ROS and PF-bound EPFRs due to light irradiation increased as well, and displayed significant correlations with the OP (Spearman r > 0.6, p < 0.05). The photoaged PF-MP distinctly increased the cellular ROS and reduced the cell viability of human lung epithelial adenocarcinoma cells (A549). The cytotoxicity of PF-MP showed a similar trend with the OP level in PF-MP, suggesting that the produced active species induced the in vitro toxicities. The results not only highlight the adverse health effects of photoaged PF-MP, but also provide new perspectives for the environmental risks of airborne MPs.									26	0	0	0	22	0	26			0160-4120	1873-6750		WOS:000580632000053	32961468

We report here that the precursor of the extrinsic 30 kDa protein of photosystem II (PS II) encoded by nuclear DNA is not a polyprotein. The precursor was identified as a 45 kDa protein by immunoprecipitation of in vitro translation products of mRNA and by a pulse-chase experiment.

The interrelationship between HCO3-, NO3- and Cl- as effective anions in the photosynthetic electron transport								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				61	1			33	37		10.1134/S1021443714010099				JAN 2014	2014	Thylakoids were isolated from the leaves of three different plants (Pisum sativium L., Lactuca sativa L., and Raphanus sativus L.). The addition of HCO (3) (-) to a suspension of salt-and HCO (3) (-) -epleted thylakoids (suspended in salt-free medium) raised the rate of O-2 evolution up to fourfold. This stimulation could be partially replaced by the addition of chloride or nitrate ions. However, the addition of HCO (3) (-) in the presence of Cl- or NO (3) (-) resulted in a higher stimulation of O-2 evolution (sixfold in the presence of nitrate and sevenfold in the presence of chloride). On the other hand, the addition of HCO (3) (-) to the thylakoids depleted from salt only raised the rate of O-2 evolution by 10-15%, whereas 40-70% was obtained by the addition of nitrate or chloride ions. The fluorescence induction studies indicated a significant decrease in the yield of the variable fluorescence of the salt- and HCO (3) (-) -depleted thylakoids. A partial increase in the fluorescence yield was obtained by the addition of HCO (3) (-) alone. A typical fluorescence induction curves were obtained by the addition of HCO (3) (-) in the presence of Cl- or NO (3) (-) ions. The data obtained suggest a similar role for chloride and nitrate ions in O-2 evolution in the Hill-reaction, which is restricted at the donor side of photosystem II, whereas bicarbonate plays its role at both sides (acceptor and donor sides). The presented data are those obtained for the thylakoids of P. sativium, which were more or less similar to those obtained for L. sativa and R. sativus.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1021-4437	1608-3407		WOS:000329109700004

This multi-step con vers ion involves the in-situ transformation of a Mn-C bonded complex to a Mn-O bonded one. When 2 is stirred with HCl, it is converted quantitatively to the covalent chloride (dppe)(CO)(3)Mn-Cl, 11, with evolution of carbon dioxide. Similar HCl treatment of the manganese carboxylate 1 gives three compounds: the same covalent chloride, 11; the ionic chloride, [(dppe)(CO)(4)Mn]Cl-+(-), 12, and the hydride, (dppe)(CO)(3)Mn-H, 5. Reasonable schemes for these conversions are suggested. Heating the ionic chloride complex to its melting point converts it to the covalent chloride complex; the same transformation is accomplished by refluxing the ionic chloride in acetonitrile.

CR-group carbonaceous chondrites are among the most primitive of all chondrite types and must have preserved solar nebula records largely unchanged. We have analyzed the oxygen and magnesium isotopes in a range of the CR constituents of different formation temperatures and ages, including refractory inclusions and chondrules of various types. The results provide new constraints on the time variation of the oxygen isotopic composition of the inner (<5 AU) solar nebula - the region where refractory inclusions and chondrules most likely formed. A chronology based on the decay of short-lived Al-26 (t(1/2) similar to 0.73 Myr) indicates that the inner solar nebula gas was O-16-rich when refractory inclusions formed, but less than 0.8 Myr later, gas in the inner solar nebula became O-16-poor, and this state persisted at least until CR chondrules formed similar to 1-2 Myr later. We suggest that the inner solar nebula became O-16-poor because meter-sized icy bodies, which were enriched in O-17 and O-18 as a result of isotopic self-shielding during the ultraviolet photo-dissociation of CO in the protosolar molecular cloud or protoplanetary disk, agglomerated outside the snow line, drifted rapidly toward the Sun, and evaporated at the snow line. This led to significant enrichment in O-16-depleted water, which then spread through the inner solar system. Astronomical studies of the spatial and temporal variations of water abundance in protoplanetary disks may clarify these processes.									67	1	0	0	0	0	67			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000228093400050

Here, we investigated the electrochemical oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde via direct electron transfer at a carbon electrode. Selectivity to benzaldehyde depended on the current and electrode type, being highest (92%) for a graphite rod. The higher selectivity to benzaldehyde at graphite rod attribute to its high electrochemically active surface area and the large number of defect sites, which favorably absorb benzaldehyde, thereby preventing further oxidation to benzoic acid. Tafel analysis revealed the rate-determining step in the electrochemical toluene oxidation reaction, which has been underexplored previously. The developed method was successfully applied to other para-substituted toluene and was therefore well suited for the sustainable production of benzaldehyde derivatives.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582367700009

Reaching such performances shall require a combination of gas-fed reactants and the corresponding diffusion electrodes, along with ion-exchange membranes and ionomers that set the operative pH at the cells' cathode and anode. The latter constitutes a key design parameter that must be combined with the need to minimize the crossover of reaction products and/or (bi)carbonate anions from the cathode to the anode, whereby their reoxidation to carbon dioxide leads to a decrease in the device's net CO2 consumption.									16	1	1	0	1	0	17			2451-9103			WOS:000599420500016

The aim was to evaluate physiological responses of Cd in Alternanthera tenella plants in micro-controlled conditions and to assess the its tolerance level and bioindicator potential. Nodal segments of A. tenella were grown in flasks containing semisolid MS medium supplemented with (0, 50, 100, and 150 mu M Cd). The total fresh and dry weight of the plants, in addition to physiological analyses, were determined after 30 days of cultivation. Plants submitted to Cd showed a reduction in biomass and photosynthetic pigments content. The decline in the Chl a/b ratio indicated the deleterious effects of Cd, as evidenced by the decrease in the density of active reaction centers (RC/CSM). The levels of deterioration in the functionality or structural integrity of the thylakoid membranes (WL) and the activity of the oxygen evolution complex (W-K) increased as a function of Cd concentrations. The decreases in photochemical and non-photochemical quenching (qP and qN, respectively) observed in plants exposed to Cd indicated photochemical dysfunctions. Additionally, the increase in the quantum yield of non-regulated energy dissipation (Phi NO) indicated the presence of photodamage. Plants had a low/intermediate TI level (>= 21.7) in the analyzed concentration range. A. tenella plants can bioaccumulate high amounts of Cd. The level of physiological responses of A. tenella is dependent on the concentration of Cd, which makes the use of this species even more promising as a bioindicator for this metal.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0792-9978	2223-8980		WOS:000839469700001

In this study, we chose to systematically compare eight synthetic oxide structures containing Mn(III) and Mn(IV) only, with particular emphasis on the five known structural polymorphs of MnO2. We have adapted literature synthesis methods to obtain pure polymorphs and validated their homogeneity and crystallinity by powder X-ray diffraction and both transmission and scanning electron microscopies. Measurement of water oxidation rate by oxygen evolution in aqueous solution was conducted with dispersed nanoparticulate manganese oxides and a standard ruthenium dye photo-oxidant system. No Ru was absorbed on the catalyst surface as observed by XPS and EDX. The post reaction atomic structure was completely preserved with no amorphization, as observed by HRTEM. Catalytic activities, normalized to surface area (BET), decrease in the series Mn2O3 > Mn3O4 >> lambda-MnO2, where the latter is derived from spinel LiMn2O4 following partial Li+ removal. No catalytic activity is observed from LiMn2O4 and four of the MnO2 polymorphs, in contrast to some literature reports with polydispersed manganese oxides and electro-deposited films. Catalytic activity within the eight examined Mn oxides was found exclusively for (distorted) cubic phases, Mn2O3 (bixbyite), Mn3O4 (hausmannite), and lambda-MnO2 (spinel), all containing Mn(III) possessing longer Mn-O bonds between edge-sharing MnO6 octahedra. Electronically degenerate Mn(III) has antibonding electronic configuration e(g)(1) which imparts lattice distortions due to the Jahn-Teller effect that are hypothesized to contribute to structural flexibility important for catalytic turnover in water oxidation at the surface.									482	19	0	0	70	1	491			0002-7863			WOS:000315936700038	23391134

Therefore, the rapid oxidation removal of CO intermediates is crucial to the durability of EOR-based catalysts. Herein, in order to effectively avoiding the catalyst CO poisoning and improve the durability, the graphene-nickel nitride hybrids (AG-Ni3N) were designed for supporting palladium nanoparticles (Pd/AG-Ni3N) and then used for ethanol electrooxidation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated the introduction of AG-Ni3N depresses the CO absorption and simultaneously promotes the adsorption of OH species for CO oxidation removal. The fabricated Pd/AG-Ni3N catalyst distinctively exhibits excellent electroactivity with the mass catalytic activity of 3499.5 mA mg(-1) on EOR in alkaline media, which is around 5.24 times higher than Pd/C (commercial catalyst). Notably, the Pd/AG-Ni3N hybrids display excellent stability and durability after chronoamperometric measurements with a total operation time of 150,000 s.

The chemistry at the interface of the carbon overcoat and the magnetic layer was studied using Angle-Resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARXPS). For a-C overcoats thinner than 20 Angstrom, the interface was found to consist of metal carbides, metal oxides, and carbon-metal-oxygen complexes, most likely carbonyls. In marked contrast, a clean transition from metals to carbon with thin metal carbides at the interface was found for the 40 Angstrom a-C overcoat. The evolution of the C Is, Co 2p, Ta 4f, and O Is spectra as a function of carbon thickness and polar angle suggests that the carbon films form in a layer-by-layer fashion. The oxygen from the ambient can diffuse through carbon films when the carbon thickness is less than or equal to 20 Angstrom, and leads to the formation of metal oxides and carbonyls at the carbon-metal interface. Overlayer thickness of similar to 40 Angstrom effectively inhibits oxygen diffusion and thus leaves the magnetic layer fully intact. This similar to 40 Angstrom carbon thickness points to a required minimum coverage necessary to maintain a functionally viable magnetic hard disk as well as other systems that use carbon overcoats on polished metal substrates.

For both cationic and anionic naked clusters, the rates of reaction with NO increase smoothly with cluster size in the range studied without the dramatic size-dependent fluctuations often associated with the reactions of transition-metal clusters. The cationic clusters react significantly faster than the anions and both exhibit rate constants exceeding collision rates calculated by average dipole orientation theory. Both the approximate magnitude and the trends in reactivity are modeled well by the surface charge capture model recently proposed by Kummerlowe and Beyer. All clusters studied here exhibit pseudo-first-order kinetics with no sign of biexponential kinetics often interpreted as evidence for multiple isomeric structures. Experiments involving prolonged exposure to NO have revealed interesting size-dependent trends in the mechanism and efficiency of NO decomposition: For most small clusters (n < 17), once two NO molecules are coadsorbed on a cluster, N-2 is evolved, generating the corresponding dioxide cluster. By analogy with experiments on extended surfaces, this observation is interpreted in terms of the dissociative adsorption of NO in the early stages of reaction, generating N atoms that are mobile on the surface of the cluster. For clusters where n < 13, this chemistry, which occurs independently of the cluster charge, repeats until a size-dependent, limiting oxygen coverage is achieved. Following this, NO is observed to adsorb on the oxide cluster without further N-2 evolution. For n = 14-16 no single end-point is observed and reaction products are based on a small range of oxide structures. By contrast, no evidence for N-2 production is observed for clusters n = 13 and n > 16, for which simple sequential NO adsorption dominates the chemistry. Interestingly, there is no evidence for the production of N2O or NO2 on any of the clusters studied. A simple general mechanism is proposed that accounts for all observations. The detailed decomposition mechanisms for each cluster exhibit size (and, by implication, structure) dependent features with Rh-13(+/-) particularly anomalous by comparison with neighboring clusters.									85	1	0	0	1	0	86			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000240654800008	16986831	
J	Ermakova-Gerdes, S; Vermaas, W								Mobility of the primary electron-accepting plastoquinone Q(A) of photosystem II in a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 strain carrying mutations in the D2 protein								BIOCHEMISTRY				37	33			11569	11578		10.1021/bi9806596				AUG 18 1998	1998	Upon introduction of random mutations in a region of the psbDI gene that encodes the D2 protein in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, an obligate photoheterotrophic mutant was isolated that contained three mutations: V247M, A249T, and M329I. This mutant evolved oxygen in the absence of added electron accepters, but oxygen evolution was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of several artificial quinones. Complementation analysis showed that the V247M and/or A249T mutations were responsible for this phenotype. Using fluorescence induction and decay measurements, the site of inhibition by the quinones was found to be at the level of the primary electron-accepting quinone in photosystem II, Q(A). Duroquinone inhibited by blocking reduction of Q(A), and in the presence of other quinones such as 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone, 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone, and p-benzoquinone, Q(A) could be reduced but could not efficiently transfer an electron to Q(B). To distinguish the effects of the V247M and A249T mutations, single mutants were created. V247M was photoautotrophic and had an essentially normal phenotype. The A249T mutant, although photoautotrophic, was affected by artificial quinones, but less than the mutant carrying both the V247M and A249T changes, The results indicate a decreased plastoquinone affinity at the Q(A) Site in the strains carrying a A249T mutation, such that after dark-adaptation a significant percentage of the Q(A) sites is empty or is occupied by an artificial quinone. In light, the percentage of photosystem II centers with plastoquinone bound at the Q(A) site appears to increase, which may be due in part to an increased affinity of the semiquinone versus that of the quinone at the Q(A) site.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0006-2960			WOS:000075516100021	9708993	
J	Xin, Y; Li, WD; First, EA								Stabilization of the transition state for the transfer of tyrosine to tRNA(Tyr) by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				303	2			299	310		10.1006/jmbi.2000.4126				OCT 20 2000	2000	Aminoacylation of tRNA(Tyr) involves two steps: (1) tyrosine activation to form the tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate; and (2) transfer of tyrosine from the tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate to tRNA(Tyr). In Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, Asp78, Tyr169, and Gln173 have been shown to form hydrogen bonds with the alpha -ammonium group of the tyrosine substrate during the first step of the aminoacylation reaction. Asp194 and Gln195 stabilize the transition state complex for the first step of the reaction by hydrogen bonding with the 2'-hydroxyl group of AMP and the carboxylate oxygen atom of tyrosine, respectively. Here, the roles that Asp78, Tyr169, Gln173, Asp194, and Gln195 play in catalysis of the second step of the reaction are investigated. Pre-steady-state kinetic analyses of alanine variants at each of these positions shows that while the replacement of Gln173 by alanine does not affect the initial binding of the tRNA(Tyr) substrate, it destabilizes the transition state complex for the second step of the reaction by 2.3 kcal/mol. None of the other alanine substitutions affects either the initial binding of the tRNA(Tyr) substrate or the stability of the transition state for the second step of the aminoacylation reaction. Taken together, the results presented here and the accompanying paper are consistent with a concerted reaction mechanism for the transfer of tyrosine to tRNA(Tyr), and suggest that catalysis of the second step of tRNA(Tyr) aminoacylation involves stabilization of a transition stab in which the scissile acylphosphate bond of the tyrosyl-adenylate species is strained. Cleavage of the scissile bond on the breakdown of the transition state alleviates this strain. (C) 2000 Academic Press.									19	0	0	0	13	0	20			0022-2836			WOS:000090001500016	11023794

Herein, a cobalt-copper couple addresses this gap-area where the best performing catalyst consists of an electrically conducting backbone of 57 wt % Cu0.9Co0.1 alloy and 10 wt % Co with higher valence surface states of CoO, Cu2O, CuO, and Co3O4 with 19.7, 10, 2.9, and 0.3 wt %, respectively. Computational studies show the Co-center as the active site for OER and ORR, while charge transfer from the Co to Cu center accumulates the electronic charge at the junction between the surface CoO and the alloy core facilitating the adsorption of oxygenated species. The 24 h air-oxidized electrodeposited-catalyst shows OER overpotentials of 225, 290, and 312 mV at 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with at least 150 h operational stability at 1.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). By electrodepositing the catalyst on high-priced Ni-foam, record-low overpotentials of 190, 281, and 298 mV are observed at 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2). Since the ORR overpotential is only 550 mV at -1 mA cm(-2) on CFP, the bifunctionality index (BI) subsides to 0.775 V. The rechargeable zinc-air battery (ZAB) delivers a stellar 948 mA.h.gZn(-1) specific capacity, 68.8 mW cm(-2) power density, and uninterrupted one-week operational stability. Even in the presence of Cl- ions in alkaline artificial seawater, the OER overpotential is retained at 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and the ZAB specific capacity is slightly reduced to 759.5 mA.h.gZn(-1). A synergistic bimetallic composition, measured higher valence surface states with singly occupied e(g) orbitals, and branched morphology, facilitates the optimum adsorption and desorption of the intermediates.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000717346600022		
J	Zide, Dorcas; Felix, Cecil; Oosthuysen, Tobie; Bladergroen, Bernard Jan								Synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemical properties of the Mg and Mn doped-Ni(OH)(2) for use as active cathode materials in NiFe batteries								JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				895						115418	10.1016/j.jelechem.2021.115418		JUN 2021		AUG 15 2021	2021	Ni(OH)(2) is one of the most interesting electrode substances for high-performance nickel-iron batteries owing to its low cost, high specific capacitance, and environmental compatibility. However, the Ni(OH)(2) cathode electrode exhibits poor performance due to (i) competitive reactions such as the oxidation of the active material and oxygen evolution. (H) the reduced charge acceptance of the Ni(OH)(2) positive electrode is related to a relatively long distance between the Ni(OH)(2) particles and the nearest portion of the substrate. In this study, beta-Ni(OH)(2) is used as a starting material. Then, the Ni2+ in the compound beta-Ni(OH)(2) material is partially substituted with Mg2+ and Mn2+, separately, and the performance of the as-prepared materials was optimized and examined. XRD, FTIR, TG-DTA, SEM/EDS, and ICP-OES confirmed the formation of the expected compositions. The Ni0.95Mg0.05(OH)(2) and Ni0.9Mn0.1(OH)(2) based-samples were optimal compositions with promising electro-chemical activities. The partial substitution of Mg( )(2+)allowed separation of anodic/cathodic peaks and oxygen evolution. For example, the anodic and cathodic peaks are easier to identify because their potential shifted to more negative potentials. When using three-electrode configurations, the un-doped Ni(OH)(2) electrode discharge capacity showed a reduction of 76% after the 100th cycle. In contrast, the Ni0.95Mg0.05(OH)(2) and Ni0.9Mn0.1(OH)(2) electrode demonstrated a reduction of only 15% and 12% in discharge capacities after 100th cycles, respectively. When using a two-electrode configuration, the obtained discharge capacities were 40 mAh/g for the un-doped Ni(OH)(2) electrode, 120 mAh/g for the Ni0.95Mg0.05(OH)(2) electrode, and 159 mAh/g for the Ni0.9Mn0.1(OH)(2) electrode with an electrode cycle life of 43.49%, 88.24%, 88.54%, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000693675300013		
J	Ma, Shiwei; Cheng, Fang; Lu, Ping; Song, Tao					Song, Tao/0000-0001-6284-4004			Enhanced performance of hematite oxygen carrier by CeO2 for chemical looping hydrogen generation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				47	8			5130	5141		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.11.189				JAN 26 2022	2022	Natural hematite is a promising oxygen carrier for chemical looping hydrogen generation (CLHG) owing to its abundance and low price. However, the reactivity of hematite is poor compared with the artificial oxygen carriers. To solve this problem, modified hematite with different CeO2 loading amounts were prepared, and the redox reactivity, cyclic stability, sintering and carbon deposition resistance were investigated with the original hematite (0%CeO2) as the control group. It was found that the CeO2-modified hematite presented far higher H2 yield and purity than 0%CeO2, and the hematite with CeO2 loading amount of 20 wt % (20%CeO2) displayed the highest reactivity, carbon deposition resistance, and satisfactory cyclic stability. The H2 yield of 20%CeO2 was 110% higher than that of 0%CeO2, and the H2 purity of the former was 99.71% vs 98.36% for the latter. The desirable performance of 20%CeO2 could be ascribed to the promotion effects of CeO2 on the lattice oxygen mobility. Specifically, the cubic fluorite CeO2 and the generated perovskite CeFeO3 provided channels for the lattice oxygen transport, enhancing the redox reactivity. The CeO2 modification could also inhibit the Fe outward migration to particle surface and thus increase the sintering resistance. The generation of cerium silicate could be inimical to the oxygen mobility, however, it could restrain the growth of CeO2 crystallite. Moreover, the interaction between CeO2 and Fe2O3 could decrease their crystallite sizes and further promote the sintering resistance. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Hydrogen energy is considered a promising renewable energy to replace fossil fuels because it is a sustainable, clean, and green energy source. Among hydrogen production methods, water splitting has the highest reliability and is used the most often. Platinum is normally used as water splitting catalyst and an electrode. However, there has been much effort to replace it as such owing to its high cost. Copper (Cu) is not used as water splitting catalyst or an electrode, despite its high current density, because of its corrosive properties. In this study, carbon was coated onto a Cu substrate and a hydrogen production experiment was carried out with 0.1 M Na 2 SO4 and 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolytes. As a result, the carbon coating decreased oxidation rate of the Cu electrode and effected stability in shortterm hydrogen evolution experiment. This indicates the possibility of carbon-Cu electrode with other catalytic materials. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The material showed a current density of 27 mA/cm(2) at an overpotential of 350 mV, which is comparable to the best-performing nickel-iron-layered double hydroxides for water oxidation in alkaline media. The enhanced conductivity and facile electron transfer were suggested among important factors for the high activity of nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide. In the present study, the stability of an Ni-V catalyst was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and electrochemical characterization methods. These methods show that the initial Ni-V catalyst during water oxidation in alkaline conditions is converted from an initial alpha-Ni(OH)(2) phase to a partially oxidized alpha-Ni(OH)(2/)NiOOH phase and VO(4)(3-)ions. We carefully evaluate the stability of the catalysts and analyze the compositional changes during prolonged water-oxidation conditions using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The experiments using both Fe-free electrolyte and Fe-free nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide reveal that vanadium do not affect the water-oxidizing activity of alpha-Ni(OH)(2).									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200035		
J	Fu, Bing; Wu, Zhijiao; Guo, Kai; Piao, Lingyu								Rutile TiO2 single crystals delivering enhanced photocatalytic oxygen evolution performance								NANOSCALE				13	18			8591	8599		10.1039/d1nr01544c		APR 2021		MAY 14 2021	2021	Owing to their scientific and technological importance, the development of highly efficient photocatalytic water oxidation systems with rapid photogenerated charge separation and high surface catalytic activity is highly desirable for the storage and conversion of solar energy. A promising candidate is rutile phase titanium dioxide (TiO2), which has been widely studied over half a century. Specifically, oriented single-crystalline TiO2 surfaces with high oxidative reactivity would be most desirable, but achieving these structures has been limited by the availability of synthetic techniques. In this study, a facile and green synthetic approach was developed for the first time to synthesize rutile TiO2 single crystals with regulable reductive and oxidative facets. Glycolic acid (GA) and sodium fluoride (NaF) are used as the crucial and effective phase and facet controlling agents, respectively. The selective adsorption of F- ions on the facets of rutile TiO2 crystals not only plays a key role in driving the nucleation and preferential growth of the crystals with desired facets but also significantly affects their photocatalytic gas evolution reactivity. With heat treatment, the highly stable F--free rutile TiO2 single crystals with a high percentage of oxidative facets exhibit a superior photocatalytic gas evolution rate (approximate to 116 mu mol h(-1) per 0.005 g catalyst), 8.5 times higher than that of previous F--containing samples.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000645230700001	33913459

Both mechanisms can coexist under conditions where the rates of both processes are similar, depending mainly on the nature of the mineral, temperature, and fluid composition. To clarify the synergies between these reaction mechanisms, we investigated the replacement and recrystallization reactions of chalcopyrite in the presence of a Cu-65-enriched aqueous fluid. The replacement of chalcopyrite by secondary copper sulfides follows a paragenetic sequence, whereby chalcopyrite is initially replaced by covellite, and then by digenite, with some of the digenite replacing covellite in longer duration experiments. The replacement reactions proceed via ICDR along with solid-state diffusion of Cu-65 from the fluid into product minerals, with both mechanisms occurring at similar rates. Over time, chalcopyrite is completely replaced, and the secondary copper sulfides attain isotopic equilibrium with the fluid. Depending on temperature, thermal history, and fluid-mineral ratio, the reaction products may preserve kinetic or equilibrium signatures. We have identified a new geochemical process of 'porosity-aided recrystallization', which may result in a re-equilibration or perturbation of mineral isotopic/trace element compositions due to exchanges between the mineral and fluid facilitated by extensive micro- to nano-scale porosity created by ICDR reactions. Porosity-aided recrystallization will affect any mineral-fluid system where mass transfers via solid-state diffusion and ICDR operate at similar rates, causing rapid (days-weeks) 'resetting' of the original isotopic abundances and trace element contents of the affected minerals. In copper sulfides, porosity-aided recrystallization occurs at lower temperatures (<300 degrees C) due to fast cation diffusion rates (log(10)D approximate to-13.6, 300 degrees C), but also takes place across other mineral systems where diffusion rates are faster at high temperatures. The open-system isotopic and trace element exchanges associated with porosity-aided recrystallization could lead to erroneous petrological interpretations, especially where these markers are used as a proxy for reconstructing geological evolution.

Forming in a platelet morphology, these particles are as small as 20 nm with a BET surface area of 37 m(2) g(-1) WO3. These nanoplatelets are active for the photocatalytic oxidation of the 1 degrees alcohols benzyl alcohol (rate constant, k of 2.6 x 10(-3) h(-1)) and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural (k of 0.01 h(-1)) using 10 mg of WO3 with 2 mL of 0.250 M substrate in acetonitrile and a 150 mW cm(-2) 460 nm blue LED source. As expected, these rate constants are larger than those observed for commercially prepared, micron-sized WO3. XPS analysis shows that during catalysis, the concentration of W5+ on the surface increases, but the nanoplatelets are stable under these reaction conditions. The overall morphology and size of the particles are retained through the reactions. Moreover, the nanoplatelets are recyclable-showing no loss in activity for four reaction cycles.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000486208200042	35529668

The results showed that, with the equivalent addition of the corresponding hydroxystannate, the soft PVC treated with hydroxystannate-coated CaCO3 had a higher limited oxygen index than the corresponding hydroxystannate, and the soft PVC treated with the agents containing magnesium had a higher limited oxygen index than the soft PVC treated with the agents containing strontium, except for ZHS-MgSn(OH)(6)-coated CaCO3. The improvement in the char formation of the hydroxystannate-coated CaCO3 was better than that of the corresponding hydroxystannate in most cases, and the aforementioned agents reduced the smoke density rating, decreased the tensile strength, and increased the elongation and impact strength basically. Thermal analysis showed that the additives promoted the evolution of hydrogen chloride, early crosslinking, and rapid charring through the strong catalyzing effect of Lewis acids.

The hexavalent chromium species Cr2O72-, HCrO4- and CrO42- present in the solution catalyze the disproportionation reaction. In both the absence and presence of chromium(VI), disproportionation is a third-order reaction with respect to HClO and ClO-, and a first-order reaction with respect to the hexavalent chromium species. In the presence of chromium(VI) ions, four parallel reactions probably take place in the solution i.e. uncatalyzed disproportionation and three parallel reactions catalyzed by Cr2O72-, HCrO4- and CrO42- ions. Most likely, the hexavalent chromium species do not change the sequence of elementary reactions in the disproportionation mechanism but only speed up the rate-determining step through interaction with its reactants. In the chlorate production process, as chromium(VI) concentration increases, the optimum pH which ensures the maximum rate of disproportionation is shifted to an acid environment. This is due to an increase in the concentration of the catalytically most active species HCrO4-with increasing acidity of the solution. A mathematical model of the kinetics of the chromium(VI)-catalyzed disproportionation of hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid into chlorate was set up. Good agreement was obtained between theoretical and experimental data. (c) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000431786800089

Synthesized catalyst was characterized by several analytical techniques i.e., FTIR, XRD, BET, TEM, FE-SEM, XPS, EPR and IC-PMS techniques. Response surface methodology (RSM) based central composite design (CCD) was used to optimized the operating parameters within their ranges e.g., oxidant dose (H2O2) 5-25 mM, catalyst dose 300-1500 mg/L, pH 2.5-10.5 and reaction temperature 30-70 degrees C and their influences on acrylonitrile and COD removal were observed. In particular, enhanced removal of acrylonitrile (95.62%) and COD (88.95%) were obtained under the optimal conditions from RSM techniques. In order to evaluated the toxicity of resin wastewater, phytotoxicity study was carried out on various species as Vigna radiatus L., Cicer arietinum and Hordeum vulgare L. etc. Acrylonitrile and COD degradation kinetics were performed by two-step degradation and well fitted by first order kinetic model at different temperatures. The degradation pathways of acrylonitrile were elucidated by temporal evolution of intermediates and final products detected by GC-MS analysis along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger study. Over the four cycle experiments only 14.93% of acrylonitrile and 18.78% of COD removal efficiency were inhibited with and very low metal leaching. The overall operating cost of treatment process was estimated as 50.72$/m(3) of ABS resin wastewater.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2213-2929	2213-3437		WOS:000632622700001

The shape, size, arrangement, phases and crystalline structures of Ge-Pt nanoparticles were determined, and the ability to be dispersed in nonpolar solvents enabled them to form a catalyst ink with a stable ejection for the spray coating technique. A series of electrochemical analyses confirmed the catalytic properties of Ge Pt nanoparticles toward the l(-)/l(3)(-) redox reaction system. The DSSC using GePt3 nanoparticles as the counter electrode exhibited excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.04% at 0.16 cm(2), which was comparable to that of a DSSC using Pt as the counter electrode (8.0%); it also exhibited an average PCE of 7.26% even at a large working area (2 cm(2)). In addition, the GePt3 catalyst exhibited excellent HER electrocatalytic performance with a large current density and a low Tafel slope, and it could stably operate at a working area of up to 5 cm 2 with a low over potential (<0.06 V) to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) cathodic current.

Since both kinds of redox cofactors were available in the pre-protein RNA world, it is challenging to explore which one was more involved in redox processes of primitive proteins? In this paper, using an examination of the redox cofactor usage of putative ancient proteins, we infer that organic ligands participated more frequently than transition metals in redox reactions of primitive proteins, at least as protein cofactors. This is further supported by the relative abundance of amino acids in the primordial world.

A large number of studies can be found in the literature regarding the development of novel functional catalysts for hydrogen production from various reactions such as hydrocarbon reforming, water gas shift reaction, and water decomposition reaction. Due to the unique surface and electronic properties of molybdenum carbide, it has been attracted more and more attentions as a potential catalyst. This article reviews the latest research progress on the molybdenum carbide catalyst for hydrogen production. Two main parts are included in this review: preparation of molybdenum carbide and application of it in hydrogen production technology. In the first part, various molybdenum carbide preparation methods and the strategies to modify the physicochemical properties of molybdenum carbide are described. It is concluded that solid-solid reaction method could provide high surface area and the synthesis process is relatively easy and safe. Furthermore, the addition of second metal could increase molybdenum carbide surface area and adjust catalyst surface electronic condition. In the second part, the applications of molybdenum carbide based catalysts for various reactions for hydrogen production are described. The catalytic activity, stability, and deactivation and reaction mechanism over molybdenum carbide catalyst are critically reviewed and discussed. It indicates that molybdenum carbide should be an alternative catalyst with high efficiency for hydrogen production.									134	8	1	0	5	0	138			1364-0321			WOS:000401395000089

A preliminary attempt to treat the diluted wastewater with a single SBR resulted in ineffective removal of the color, ammonia, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Next, COP was applied as a pretreatment in order to obtain a bio-compatible wastewater for SBR treatment in a second step. The effectiveness of the COP pretreatment was assessed by evaluating wastewater biodegradability enhancement (the ratio of biology oxygen demand after 5 d (BOD(5)) to COD), as well as monitoring the evolution of TOC, carbon oxidation state (COS), average oxidation state (AOS), color, and major pollutant concentrations with reaction time. In the COP, the catalyst preserved its catalytic properties even after 70 reuse cycles, exhibiting good durability and stability. The performance of SBR to treat COP effluent was also examined. At an organic loading rate of 2.0 kg COD/(m(3)center dot d), with hydraulic retention time (HRT)=10 h and temperature (30 +/- 2) A degrees C, the average removal efficiencies of NH(3)-N, COD, BOD(5), TOC, and color in a coupled COP/SBR process were about 80%, 95.8%, 93.8%, 97.6% and 99.3%, respectively, with average effluent concentrations of 10 mg/L, 128 mg/L, 27.5 mg/L, 25.0 mg/L, and 20 multiples, respectively, which were all consistent with the national standards for secondary discharge of industrial wastewater into a public sewerage system (GB 8978-1996). The results indicated that the coupling of COP with a biological process was proved to be a technically and economically effective method for treating industrial wastewater containing recalcitrant CNACs.									21	1	0	0	11	1	22			1673-1581			WOS:000275122400003	20205304

The La0.6Sr0.4CoO3-delta (LSC) perovskite is one among the classes which is easy to fabricate, cost-effective, and scalable. Defect engineering by sintering and interface engineering by in situ surface modification are employed to positively transform the LSC perovskite electrode, that is, by sintering at a high temperature, phase-pure LSC is obtained with induced changes such as improved conductivity, crystal defects, and oxygen vacancies. By chemically modifying the surface of this LSC using highly catalytically active NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH), excellent bifunctionality is achieved. For the latter, an optimized molar ratio of NiFe LDH (25%) is integrated onto the phase-pure LSC surface by a simple wet-chemical process. The phase purity and bifunctionality of the prepared composite are verified by various physical characterizations and redox processes. The surface-modified LSC/LDH (75/25) cathode demonstrates superior oxygen reduction and evolution reaction performances that are better than those of the native LSC with a low overall overpotential of 0.71 V at 5 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. The same cathode when applied in a zinc-air battery exhibits a stable cycle performance with a reduced charge-discharge potential gap of 0.73 V at 5 mA cm(-2) for 100 cycles in alkaline media. Additionally, LSC/LDH (75/25) also ensures long-term performance with remarkable stability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000621660800087

Based on the calorimetric results, it was found that the mixing sequence of alkali silicate solutions greatly changed the hydration kinetics of the alkali-activated slags (AAS), which indicates highly dynamic silicate structures in the activator. Although S1 with a higher specific surface area and basicity was less reactive than S2 in the presence of silicate anions, the influence of silicate anions on the hydration kinetics of alkali activated S1 and S2 was divergent. To solve the issues, NBO/T (the number of Non-Bridging-Oxygen per SiO4 Tetrahedral unit) ratio for the depolymerization degree of glass structure was innovatively introduced into AAS study by taking both precursor and alkali activator into consideration. The results show NBO/T has a strong capacity to predict hydration kinetics and compressive strength of AAS at early age. However, a dynamic equilibrium of the silicate species between the slag and water glass determined the hydration kinetics of the water glass-activated slag. This study provides a worthwhile exploration direction for clarifying the AAS hydration kinetics based on combination of quantitative glass structure index and isothermal calorimetrical analysis.
