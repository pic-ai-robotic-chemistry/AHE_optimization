As a widely available daily waste, eggshell membranes have unique porous three-dimensional grid-like fibrous structures with relatively high surface area and abundant macropores, allowing for effective conjugation of carbon nanotubes and growth of NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays, an effective supercapacitor material and OER catalyst. The three-dimensional fibrous eggshell membrane frameworks with carbon nanotubes offer efficient pathways for charge transport, and the macropores between adjacent fibers are fully accessible for electrolytes and bubble evolution. As a supercapacitor, the eggshell membrane/carbon nanotube/NiCo2O4 electrode shows high specific capacitances at current densities from 1 to 20 A g(-1), with excellent capacitance retention (>90%) at 10 A g(-1) for over 10 000 cycles. When employed as an OER catalyst, this eggshell membrane-based electrode exhibits an OER onset potential of 1.53 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a stable catalytic current density of 20 mA cm(-2) at 1.65 V vs. the RHE.									35	1	0	0	4	0	36			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000360117200023	26247312

It was shown that the activation energy for the reduction of oxygen is higher than the activation energy for the reduction nitric oxide. The activity for the reduction of both oxygen and nitric oxide was shown to be highest for the end member La0.65Sr0.35Cr0.97V0.03O3-delta. The highest ratio between the current densities in the nitric oxide and oxygen containing atmospheres was found for the end member LaCr0.97V0.03O3-delta. The chromites also showed activity as anodes for either oxygen evolution or oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

The oxygen coverages measured during reversible isothermal switches from He to NO/He mixtures showed that NO decomposition involves bimolecular reactions of two NO molecules adsorbed on vicinal Cu+ species with the formation of N2O as the initial product near ambient temperature. These vicinal Cu+ species form via oxygen removal from {Cu2+-O2--Cu2+}(2+) to form {Cu+-square-Cu+}(2+) using NO2 as an oxygen carrier among distant oxidized dimers. Adsorbed nitrate (NO3*) is the kinetically relevant intermediate in the formation of O-2 during NO decomposition. This NO3* decomposition reaction is one of the steps involved in the equilibrated formation of NO2 observed during NO decomposition. These NO-mediated oxygen removal pathways, in which NO acts both as a reductant and as an oxidant, are significantly more rapid than recombinative desorption steps. The desorption of products and of unreacted NO during reactions of preadsorbed NO with increasing catalyst temperature confirmed the bimolecular nature and the low activation energy for N2O formation from NO. The facile nature of this reaction and the unfavorable NO adsorption thermodynamics as temperature increases combine to give the observed decrease in NO decomposition rates at high temperatures. These findings are consistent with some reported mechanism-based steady-state rate expressions and with previous infrared detection of the reaction intermediates proposed here based on isothermal and nonisothermal transients. These pathways appear to be relevant also to N2O decomposition reactions, which occur after the initial formation of N2O from NO and involve reactions of N2O with {Cu+-square-Cu+}(2+) and removal of oxygen via NO-mediated desorption pathways. This study brings consensus and some clarification into the mechanistic details for NO and N2O decomposition reactions and resolves some remaining discrepancies and some contradictory conclusions in previous reports.									35	2	1	0	0	0	38			1520-6106			WOS:000178010700022

Tandem photoelectrochemical water splitting devices utilize two photoabsorbers to harvest the sunlight and drive the water splitting reaction. The absorption of sunlight by electrocatalysts is a severe problem for tandem water splitting devices where light needs to be transmitted through the larger bandgap component to illuminate the smaller bandgap component. Herein, we describe a novel method for the deposition of an optically transparent amorphous iron nickel oxide oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. The catalyst was deposited on both thin film and high-aspect ratio nanostructured hematite photoanodes. The low catalyst loading combined with its high activity at low overpotential results in significant improvement on the onset potential for photoelectrochemical water oxidation. This transparent catalyst further enables the preparation of a stable hematite/perovskite solar cell tandem device, which performs unassisted water splitting.									203	8	0	0	23	0	205			0002-7863			WOS:000359613300028	26200221

The reactivity as a function of carbon conversion was systematically investigated through characterization of the pore structure and carbon active site evolution during reaction. Total surface area measured by CO, adsorption at 273 K gives a relatively constant normalized reactivity over a wide range of carbon conversions. The carbon active surface area (ASA) and unoccupied active surface area (UASA) were estimated from low-temperature NO chemisorption capacities. Large amounts of stable C-O complexes are found to form during the reaction. Results show that ASA or UASA measured in this way do not represent the reactive surface area under gasification conditions. A new kinetic model is introduced by taking into account the contributions from different carbon-oxygen surface complexes during reaction, based on the recently proposed unified kinetic scheme of Yang and coworkers.

Unfortunately, the slow kinetics of oxygen evolution (OER) on the anode side of the electrolyzer hinders the efficient and large-scale hydrogen production. In this study, starting from metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a series of bimetal phosphides CoxFe1-xP (x = 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 0.75 and 0.80) were synthesized by low-temperature phosphidiation of corresponding MOFs precursors. The as-prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Studies indicate that the proportion of cobalt and iron elements make a big differences on the structure of the materials. Benefiting from the porous structure and large specific area of the MOFs precursors, as well as the synergistic effect between Co and Fe elements, the as-synthesized Co0.66Fe0.33P shows superior electrocatalytic performances and outstanding stability toward OER in alkaline solution.

The MoxCo1-xP2/MWCNT composite electrocatalysts with controllable morphology and composition are created by changing the molar ratios of Mo : Co precursors. Mo0.29Co0.71P2/MWCNTs exhibits the best hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with low overpotentials of 85 and 220 mV in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Impressively, a cell voltage of 1.48 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)for overall water splitting has been realized by using Mo0.29Co0.71P2/MWCNTs as both the cathode and anode material, which is one of the lowest potentials for practical overall water splitting. Experimental and density functional theory results suggest that such excellent electrocatalytic performance may stem from the synergistic effect between Mo(0.29)Co(0.71)P(2)and MWCNTs.									37	1	0	0	3	0	38			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000566092600025

Thus, numerous researchers have devoted their efforts to mitigate iridium corrosion by decoration with corrosion-resistant metal oxides and/or supports to maximize OER catalyst durability whilst retaining high activity. Herein a one-step, facile electrochemical route to obtain improved IrOx thin film OER stability in acid by decorating with amorphous tungsten sulphide (WS3-x) upon electrochemical decomposition of a [WS4](2-) aqueous precursor is proposed. The rationale behind applying such WS3-x decoration stems from the generation of a tungsten oxide phase, a well-known corrosion-resistant photoactive OER catalyst. The study demonstrates the viability of the proposed WS3-x decoration, allowing the tailoring of experimental parameters responsible for WS3-x nanoparticle size and surface coverage. OER stability tests coupled by ex situ SEM and XPS corroborate the beneficial effect of WS3-x decoration, yielding improved OER specific activity metrics along with minimized Ir surface roughening, a characteristic of electrodissolution. Iridium decoration with electrodeposited, corrosion-resistant oxides is consequently shown to be a promising route to maximize OER stabilities.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2366-7486			WOS:000623173300001

The electrochemical activity of NF/Co3O4/CoFe2O4 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was assessed in alkaline medium. Under basic conditions (pH > 10), the composite electrode revealed enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity requiring an overpotential of 215 mV versus RHE to reach 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1). The enhanced OER activity was ascribed to the presence of Co3+ and Fe3+ in the octahedral sites of Co3O4 and CoFe2O4, respectively, and their synergic effect in Co3O4/CoFe2O4. This anode showed a stable current density of about 160 mA cm(-2) for 20 h; the same Co3O4/CoFe2O4/NF anode was applied for several OER experiments without loss of activity.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000101

SrCoO2.5 films with the brownmillerite phase are investigated in this study for their strain effects on the OER activity, with particular regard to the pH dependence. Pulsed laser deposited films with different thicknesses and, thus, strain conditions, are characterized in terms of long range and near-order structural properties and electrochemical OER activity. By comparison, more strained thinner films have smaller OER current at lower pH conditions, but higher sensitivity to the environment pH. Spectroscopic measurements allow us to correlate such behaviors to the Co 3d-O 2p hybridization effects of the CoO6 octahedral sites, which lead to a variation of the 3d level electronic occupation. At the same time, density functional theory calculations show that the oxygen vacancy channels of the CoO4 tetrahedral sites are stable with respect to the strain effects. These results provide new perspectives to manipulate the pH dependent OER activity through the strain effects, useful for designing water splitting-based devices with optimized performances.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000477705800028	31298262

We show density-functional theory-based correlations between surface segregation and the oxidation state of the subsurface atoms, and their effects on metal dissolution. Since the onset of Pt dissolution coincides with that of surface oxidation, surface reconstruction phenomena is evaluated using ab initio and classical molecular dynamics at increasing degrees of oxidation on extended surfaces and nanoparticles, including the effects of water and an acidic solution. Significant reconstruction and compositional changes are observed as the surface is modified by the presence of adsorbates and electrolyte components. Finally we discuss the consequences of dealloying and suggest an explanation for the enhanced activity observed experimentally in the resultant nanoporous structures.									31	4	0	0	0	0	32			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000303883700010

Transition metal oxides exhibit a wide range of structural and electronic properties, which are acutely dependent on composition and crystal structure. So far, identifying one or several properties of transition metal oxides as descriptors for oxygen electrocatalysis remains elusive. In this work, we performed a detailed experimental and computational study of LaMnxNi1-xO3 perovskite nanostructures, establishing an unprecedented correlation between electrocatalytic activity and orbital composition. The composition and structure of the single-phase rhombohedral oxide nanostructures are characterized by a variety of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron microscopy. Systematic electrochemical analysis of pseudocapacitive responses in the potential region relevant to oxygen electrocatalysis shows the evolution of Mn and Ni d-orbitals as a function of the perovskite composition. We rationalize these observations on the basis of electronic structure calculations employing DFT with HSE06 hybrid functional. Our analysis clearly shows a linear correlation between the OER kinetics and the integrated density of states (DOS) associated with Ni and Mn 3d states in the energy range relevant to operational conditions. In contrast, the ORR kinetics exhibits a second-order reaction with respect to the electron density in Mn and Ni 3d states. For the first time, our study identifies the relevant DOS dominating both reactions and the importance of understanding orbital occupancy under operational conditions.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000776234200019	35254811

In this work, focusing on the Pt/C reference catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction, we attempted to clarify its genuine stability under the most used accelerated stress test conditions and understand the reasons for the flawed results. Efforts have been made to design an electrochemical cell and an extended test protocol to control all possible experimental factors that could influence the test results. We found that simple experimental errors such as incomplete catalyst activation and accumulated electrolyte impurities could significantly affect the stability test results. Under strictly controlled conditions, a reliable stability benchmark of Pt/C catalyst toward the oxygen reduction reaction has been established.

However, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of these catalysts is still greatly inferior to that of Pt-based catalysts. In this review, the key factors to develop high performance TMO-based catalysts have been carefully detailed, including strategies to enhance their electrical conductivity, recent advances in the understanding of their intrinsic activity, and their morphology and structure design. Finally, we discussed the existing challenges and future research directions for further development of TMO-based ORR catalysts.									176	11	1	0	7	0	177			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800004

Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SEE) have been regarded for many years as strictly anaerobic bacteria, but recently, they are found to be able to survive in the presence of O-2, and how they affect the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has not been clear. In this study, the role of sulfide, a key inorganic metabolite of SEE, in ORR has been investigated on Q235 carbon steel electrode with cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Three cathodic processes are recorded on cyclic voltammograms in O-2-saturated 3.5% NaCl solution: ORR, iron oxides reduction and hydrogen evolution. The peak current of ORR decreases with the introduction of sulfide, and finally vanishes when the sulfide concentration is more than 0.5 mM. EIS reveals that sulfide leads to the disappearance of the feature of semi-infinite diffusion of ORR and the fitting results demonstrate that charge transfer resistance increases with increasing sulfide concentration. Therefore sulfide hinders the cathodic reduction of O-2 on Q235 carbon steel in 3.5% NaCl solution.

It allowed life to generate energy and reducing power directly from sunlight and water, freeing it from the limited resources of geochemically derived reductants. This greatly increased global primary productivity and restructured ecosystems. The release of O-2 as an end product of water oxidation led to the rise of oxygen, which dramatically altered the redox state of Earth's atmosphere and oceans and permanently changed all major biogeochemical cycles. Furthermore, the biological availability of O-2 allowed for the evolution of aerobic respiration and novel biosynthetic pathways, facilitating much of the richness we associate with modern biology, including complex multicellularity. Here we critically review and synthesize information from the geological and biological records for the origin and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Data from both of these archives illustrate that this metabolism first appeared in early Paleoproterozoic time and, despite its biogeochemical prominence, is a relatively late invention in the context of our planet's history.									194	2	0	0	130	0	196			0084-6597	1545-4495	978-0-8243-2044-7	WOS:000379329700024

Here, we took the advantages of high OER activity of Co3O4 spinel and high ORR activity of Ag to develop a carbon-free oxygen electrode, e.g., for Li-air batteries. The optimized Ag + Co3O4 catalyst was further characterized and exhibited a good bifunctional activity in alkaline media. From rotating ring-disk electrode results, the mixed Ag + Co3O4 catalyst revealed significantly lower (similar to 320 mV) overpotential for ORR than single Co3O4, and a slightly lower overpotential than pure Ag. A four-electron pathway was also elucidated. The OER activity of the mixed catalyst is 1.5-fold compared to pure Co3O4, although the Co3O4 loading is only 10%, suggesting a large synergistic effect. The potential difference between OER and ORR (i.e., the sum of the overpotentials at 1 mA cm(-2)) is ca.0.85 V, which is comparable to noble metal based catalysts. To better understand the origin of this synergism, an XPS analysis was performed, demonstrating that only after oxidation of the mixed catalyst, Co3O4 was reduced to Co(OH)(2) at potentials of the ORR, probably due to the presence of Ag+. This redox switching, which was not observed for pure Co3O4, is a probable explanation for the increased catalytic activity. The morphology and the electrochemically active surface area of Ag on the surface were examined by electron microscopy and lead-underpotential deposition, respectively. These results also show that when 88% of the Ag surface is blocked by Co3O4 particles, the residual 12% free Ag sites altogether have a higher activity for ORR than the (100%) pure Ag surface, i.e., the activity per Ag site is increased by more than a factor of 10. The combination of low cost and high performance endows this catalyst as a promising candidate for energy devices, and the present synergistic effect opens a new track for high activity.									22	0	0	0	2	0	22			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000412348100006

The common challenge in both processes is the development ofpreferably abundantnanostructured materials that can catalyze the electrochemical reactions of interest with a high rate over a sufficiently long period of time. An overall understanding of the related processes and mechanisms occurring under the operation conditions is a necessity for the rational design of materials that meet these requirements. A promising strategy to develop such an understanding is the investigation of the impact of material properties on reaction activity/selectivity and on catalyst stability under the conditions of operation, as well as the application of complementary insitu techniques for the investigation of catalyst structure and composition.									996	31	0	0	47	0	1012			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000328714900009	24339359

The material exhibited excellent oxygen reduction and evolution activity and, in particular, excellent cathode performance for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries. Our optimal sample yielded a specific capacity of up to 5423 mA h g(-1) and functioned for 200 cycles with no degradation. It was found that the introduction of oxygen vacancies on the surface of CoO-CoN through nitridation played a crucial role in the material's high performance, especially its high stability and long cyclability. We attribute the high performance to the following: first, the material's nanoarray architecture, which provided a large surface area and featured enough interspaces to ensure a high density of active sites as well as to assist with oxygen and ion diffusion, and with the hosting of discharge products, and second, the abundant oxygen vacancies generated on the CoO-CoN surface during partially controlled nitridation, which significantly enhanced the material's oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activity and stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000618839200055

In a first step toward mimicking these reactions, we have made a Ru(II)-polypyridine complex with an attached tyrosyl moiety. The photoexcited ruthenium complex played the role of P-680 and was first oxidized by external accepters. Combined transient absorbance and EPR studies provided evidence that the Ru(III) formed was reduced by intramolecular electron transfer from the attached tyrosine, with a rate constant of 5 x 10(4) s(-1). Thus we show that a tyrosine radical could be formed by light-induced electron transfer reactions, and we indicate future directions for developing a closer analogy with the photosystem II reactions.									130	3	0	0	32	0	130			0002-7863			WOS:A1997YE66100018

Herein, we demonstrated the coupling of the NiCo catalyst with carbon quantum dots (CDs) on the surfaces of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanodes, resulting in one of the highest currently known PEC activities of 4.26 mA cm(-2) (1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, AM 1.5G). Furthermore, the H-2 generation rate from PEC water splitting could reach up to 74.9 mu mol cm(-2) h(-1) with a faradaic efficiency of nearly 99%. The detailed experimental results clearly reveal that these CDs acted as an efficient medium for remarkably promoting hole transport from anodes to catalysts and selectively tailoring the electronic structure of surface-active sites, which significantly promoted the surface charge separation and oxygen evolution process. This work offers unique insights into the design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water splitting applications.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000744079600001

This means being in command of the tetra-protonic and tetra-electronic reaction mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction, a formidable challenge that is starting to be overcome using catalysts based on more abundant and inexpensive elements. Interestingly, the most promising ones in this context are low-cost materials based on NiFe, NiCo and NiV-LDH precursors, highly flexible and tunable materials that would enable large-scale production, storage and utilization in a more convenient and safe manner. In fact, the vast majority of high performance electrocatalysts based on ternary LDHs are being produced by doping of that matrix with Co2+/3+ and V2+/3+/4+ ions to modulate the electronic and structural properties of NiFe-LDH metal sites, thus reducing the OER overpotentials while activating and increasing the concentration of active sites and improving the OER rate. On the other hand, the V ion coordination geometry can be distorted from octahedral to tetrahedral and used to induce very strong electronic effects to the neighboring transition metal ions to adjust the metal-oxygen bond energy in the transition state to the expected optimal value, and optimize the O-2 release in the OER process. Finally, nanostructuration and deposition on suitable conducting materials generating nanocomposites can be used as additional strategies to enhance further the conductivity as well as the concentration and number of available active sites, while facilitating the electrolyte diffusion, thus improving their electrocatalytic performances. In short, catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction based on ternary LDHs were reviewed considering their key role in the way to a more sustainable society.									47	2	0	0	1	0	47			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000544636000022

In energy-saving hydrogen production, the oxygen evolution reaction in the electrolysis of water is often another important factor that restricts efficient hydrogen production. Therefore, in this study, we used carbon cloth as the base of the self-supporting electrode. Nickel and cobalt, rich non-noble metals, were introduced to the carbon cloth through a simple hydrothermal reaction. The composite phosphides of nickel and cobalt were obtained by low-temperature phosphating. The prepared materials possess a sea urchin-like microstructure which is composed of microspheres in center and nanospines on its surface. Based on this unique sea urchin-like structure, NiCoP/CC self-supporting electrode exhibits a good hydrogen evolution performance in acidic solutions. The required overpotentials were only 178 mV and 395 mV vs RHE at 10 and 100 mA cm-2, respectively. We used this NiCoP/CC self-supporting electrode as the cathode and the pure CC as the anode. Under the condition of a constant current density of 2 mA cm-2, the degradation efficiency of methylene blue at 90 min was 88% and hydrogen was produced constantly on the NiCoP/CC self-supporting electrode, which provided an idea for the combination of hydrogen evolution reaction and organic matter degradation.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000653066300012

The electrochemical properties of the composite anodes obtained under different forward pulse average current densities from 2 to 5 A/dm(2) and different CeO2 concentrations from 0 to 20 g/L in bath were investigated, the anodic polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry curves and Tafel polarization curves in a synthetic zinc electrowinning electrolyte of 50 g/L Zn2+ and 150 g/L H2SO4 at 35 degrees C were measured, and the kinetic parameters of oxygen evolution, voltammetry charge, corrosion potential and corrosion current of the composite anodes were obtained. The results show that Pb-0.3%Ag/Pb-CeO2 composite anodes obtained under forward pulse average current density of 3 A/dm(2) and CeO2 concentrations of 30 g/L in an original acid plating bath, possess higher electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution, lower overpotential of oxygen evolution, better reversibility of electrode reaction and corrosion resistance in [ZnSO4+H2SO4] solution. The overpotential of oxygen evolution of the composite anode is 1.134 V under 500 A/m(2) in [ZnSO4+H2SO4] solution, and 37 mV lower than that of Pb-1%Ag alloy; the corrosion current of the composite anode is 1.97x10(-4)A which is distinctly lower than that of Pb-1%Ag alloy, showing excellent corrosion resistance.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1002-185X			WOS:000341275700025

However, the material suffers from low Coulombic efficiency, serious capacity attenuation, severe voltage decay which can be ascribed to the irreversible oxygen loss and phase transformation. Herein, oxygen defects are induced through the pre-extraction of lithium and oxygen from Li2MnO3 component on the surface of the material accompanying with the generation of spinel structure via a facile method of hydrothermal reaction assisted with calcination clarified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The material exhibits excellent electrochemical properties including enhanced initial Coulombic efficiency over 87% and prominent capacity retention of 89.7% after 100 cycles superior to those for the pristine, which are attributed to the fact that oxygen defects inhibit evolution of oxygen, and alleviate the lattice microstrain along consecutive delithiation/lithiation process to improve mechanical property of material. Besides, the Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT) manifests that the material possesses superior dynamic condition. These results indicate that oxygen defects are beneficial to stabilize the lattice oxygen on the surface of the lithium-rich layered oxides for a high-performance cathode material for lithium-ion batteries.

J	Adams, Fred C.					Adams, Fred/0000-0002-8167-1767			Possible solution to the triple alpha fine-tuning problem: Spallation reactions during planet formation								ASTROPARTICLE PHYSICS				141						102731	10.1016/j.astropartphys.2022.102731				AUG 2022	2022	Carbon is produced during the helium burning phase of sufficiently massive stars through the triple alpha process. The 0+ energy level of the carbon nucleus allows for resonant nuclear reactions, which act to greatly increase the carbon yields compared to the non-resonant case. Many authors have argued that small changes to the energy level of this resonance would lead to a significantly lower carbon abundance in the universe, and this sensitivity is often considered an example of fine-tuning. By considering spallation reactions occurring during the process of planet formation, this paper presents a partial solution to this triple alpha fine-tuning problem. Young stellar objects generate substantial luminosities of particle radiation (cosmic rays) that can drive nuclear reactions through spallation. If the standard triple alpha process is inoperative, stars tend to synthesize oxygen (and other alpha elements) rather than carbon. Cosmic rays can interact with oxygen nuclei to produce carbon while planets are forming. The resulting carbon abundances are significant, but much smaller than those observed in our universe. However, for a range of conditions - as delineated herein - spallation reactions can result in carbon-to-oxygen ratios roughly comparable to those found on Earth and thereby obviate the triple alpha fine-tuning problem.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-6505	1873-2852		WOS:000806013000001

The composite electrocatalyst exhibited an OER current density of 10 mA cm(-2 )with an overpotential of 330 mV in 1 M KOH comparable to that of IrO2. On the other hand, the composite electrocatalyst exhibited an ORR onset potential (E-onset) of 0.82 V vs RHE. The K-L plot and rotating ring-disk electrode analysis evidenced that the ORR on the NiFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructure follows closely the 4 e(-) transfer process similar to Pt/C and delivered notable electrochemical stability after 5000 potential cycles with retention of about 90% diffusion limiting current density. The H-2-O(2 )anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) employing the cathode electrode fabricated with the NiFe2O4/MoS2 composite showed a peak power density of similar to 20 mW cm(-2). In contrast, a peak power density of similar to 51 mW cm(-2) was realized for the AEMFC employing the Pt/C cathode electrode under identical operating conditions. Considering the excellent bifunctional activity, good electrochemical performance and stability, and the low-cost facile synthetic approach, the NiFe2O4/MoS2 heterostructured composite developed in this study can be considered as a potential candidate for energy conversion and storage applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000823303500001

Cobalt-iron (oxides) have been widely studied as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), yet our understanding of the OER dynamic reactivity related to the oxidation state changes as well the adsorption energies of surface species on the metal surface linked to the water oxidation are not well-documented. In this work, a facile chemical reduction process is developed for preparation of Co-only, Co3Fe7 alloy, and Fe-only catalysts. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to evaluate metal valences and the dynamics of the oxidation state changes of the electrocatalysts in 0.1 M KOH solution, which disclose that about 20% of the Co centers get oxidized in Co-only from the oxidation state of +2 to +3/+4, while only 1% reach to +3 valence for the Co3Fe7 catalyst under cyclic voltammetry (CV) operation. The small edge changes of Fe centers in Fe-only result in negligible changing the oxidation state. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation predicts the mechanism of OER performance, which indicates that the OER activity largely relies on the metal oxidation states on the surface of catalysts. Co3O4 on the surface of Co-only catalyst presenting the most positive d-band center and the fewest e(g) electron contributes to the highest OER activity. Fe-only coated by gamma-Fe2O3 shows the lowest OER performance due to the weakest oxygen adsorption energy of gamma-Fe2O3 as well as the poor electrical conductivity of FeOOH evolved after operation. Co3Fe7 exhibiting medium OER activity is aroused by the co-existence of CoO and gamma-Fe2O3, wherein Co2+ is less active than Co3+. Introducing Fe in Co matrix could depress the formation of Co cations with high oxidation state in as-prepared catalysts, which is not favorable for oxygen production. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, insufficient understanding and investigation of key factors (e.g. reductants and ligands) in the fabrication process limits on-target design, impeding material diversity and available applications. Herein, unveiling multiple roles of reductants, we develop an efficient method, i.e. the excessive-reductant-directed gelation strategy. It enables to integrate ligand chemistry for creating gold aerogels with a record-high specific surface area (59.8m(2) g(-1)), and to expand the composition to all common noble metals. Moreover, we demonstrate impressive electrocatalytic performance of these aerogels for the ethanol oxidation and oxygen evolution reaction, and discover an unconventional organic-ligand-enhancing effect. The present work not only enriches the composition and structural diversity of noble metal aerogels, but also opens up new dimensions for devising efficient electrocatalysts for broad material systems.									58	2	0	0	4	0	58			2041-1723			WOS:000522437900006	32221287

It is still challenging to synthesize self-supporting MOF-based catalysts using simple and low-cost fabrication methods. Herein, we successfully fabricated Ni-doped MIL-53(Fe) sup-ported on nickel-iron foam (Ni-MIL-53(Fe)/NFF) as efficient electrocatalyst. A facile two-step solvothermal method without adding any metal salts was used, which can simplify the fabrication process and reduce the experimental cost. In the fabrication process, the bimetallic Ni-MIL-53(Fe)/NFF was in situ converted from an intermediate NiFe2O4/NFF. The obtained material exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic oxygen evolution performance with a low overpotential of 248 mV at 50 mA cm-2, and a small Tafel slope of 46.4 mV dec-1. This work sheds light on the simple and efficient preparation of bimetallic MOF-based material, which is promising in electrocatalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, char combustion and NO emissions during a grate-fired process were studied in a small-scale one-dimensional fixed-bed system by adjusting the char/oxygen (O-2) ratio. Evolution of the surface temperature of the char bed was measured using an infrared temperature measurement system. As the char/O-2 ratio increased, a reaction layering of the char bed occurred. The char bed can be divided into oxygen-absent and -present parts in time, and into reduction and oxidation layers in space. This kind of division was determined by the complete oxidation layer that could deplete all O-2. The reduction layer could reduce NO emissions well. With the increase of the char/O-2 ratio, the char mass proportion of the oxygen-absent part increased, while that of the oxygen-present decreased; and the NO emissions and conversion rate of char nitrogen decreased. When combustion began, char started to burn and released a large amount of heat, and the surface temperatures of both the oxidation and reduction layers increased, with a larger rise of the former of about 260 degrees C. As the reaction proceeded, the surface temperature of the oxidation layer gradually decreased, while that of the reduction layer increased until the char bed was burnt through.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0008-4034	1939-019X		WOS:000481202400001

JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				109	18			8920	8927		10.1021/jp0501289				MAY 12 2005	2005	The mechanism of water photooxidation (oxygyen photoevolution) on a TaON photocatalyst was studied on the basis of our previous studies on the mechanism of this reaction on TiO2, and N-doped TiO2. We have confirmed that photocatalytic O-2 evolution occurs from an aqueous TaON suspension in the presence of Fe3+, as reported. In-situ MIR-IR experiments have indicated that the TaON surface is slightly oxidized under visible-light irradiation, indicating that the oxygen photoevolution on TaON actually occurs on a thin Ta-oxide overlayer. The in-situ MIR-IR experiments have also shown that a certain surface peroxo species, tentatively assigned to adsorbed HOOH, is formed as an intermediate of the O-2 photoevolution reaction. Studies on the effect of addition of reductants to the electrolyte on the IPCE have shown that photogenerated holes at the TaON surface cannot oxidize reductants such as SCN-, Br-, methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol, and acetic acid, though they can oxidize H2O into O-2. Detailed considerations of these results have strongly suggested that the water photooxidation reaction on TaON proceeds by our recently proposed new mechanism, that is, the reaction is initiated by a nucleophilic attack of a water molecule (Lewis base) on a surface-trapped hole (Lewis acid).									96	2	0	0	6	0	96			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000228982900058	16852061

The critical bottleneck for it is oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requiring insufficiently low overpotentials, h. Metal oxides are the group of high performance catalysts for water oxidation, so far. We report a facile synthesis of the mixed metal oxide composite (NiO/Mndoped NiCo2O4) and an easy dip-coating method to create electrocatalysts on nickel foam as electrode substrates cause significant efficiency for OER. The mixed metal oxides catalyst was characterized by using electrochemical methods, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma (ICP) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Electrocatalysts were shown a Tafel slope of 34 mV dec1 with overpotential h 1/4 482 mV (for 100 mA cm2) and at least 20 h durable OER activity. The electrochemical data demonstrate the synergistic effect of the coupling between the three metal-centres of Ni, Co, and Mn to decline the overpotential value. The current of (OER) is related to the electrolyte pH, displaying a nonproton-concerted mechanism in an approach to identifying rate-determining steps for OER. This could be concluded by the direct neighbour lattice O =- coupling to form an O-O bond. The simple and rapid fabrication method and the promising stability and high performance of the herein developed electrodes render them quite promising for technological water splitting systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-3199	1879-3487		WOS:000746612900006

The short and, especially, the long-term effects of this technology on the colour characteristics of wines are still little known. In this study, a Cabernet Sauvignon wine was subjected to oxygenation treatments before (15 mg O-2/L in 3 weeks) and after (6 mg O-2/L in 3 months) malolactic fermentation and then aged for 20 months in barrels and/or bottles. Analysis was carried out of the dissolved oxygen concentration, the acetaldehyde content, and the evolution of several parameters related to the anthocyanic composition and the chromatic characteristics of wines for 113 weeks. The supplying oxygen significantly accelerated the kinetics of the degradation and transformation reactions of anthocyanins providing wines with a more intense bisulphite non-bleachable colour, with little or not impact on the normal evolution of their tonality. These beneficial effects produced during the treatments were kept over time, in such a way that the differences between the micro-oxygenated wines and the control wines remained after 20 months of ageing.									23	0	0	0	21	0	24			1438-2377	1438-2385		WOS:000279833000011

Making the hydroxides thinner for more surface commonly fails to increase the active site number, because the real active sites are the edges. Up to now, the overpotentials of most state-of-the-art OER electrocatalysts at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10)) are still larger than 200 mV. Herein, a novel design of mesoporous single crystal (MSC) with an Fe-rich skin to boost the OER is shown. The edges around the mesopores provide lots of real active sites and the Fe modification on these sites further improves the intrinsic activity. As a result, an ultralow eta(10) of 185 mV is achieved, and the turnover frequency based on Fe atoms is as high as 16.9 s(-1) at an overpotential of 350 mV. Moreover, the catalyst has an excellent catalytic stability, indicated by a negligible current drop after 10 000 cyclic voltammetry cycles. The catalyst enables Zn-air batteries to run stably over 270 h with a low charge voltage of 1.89 V. This work shows that MSC materials can provide new opportunities for the design of electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000782374700001	35289964

Here we characterize the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of an unexplored facet of this material with first-principles quantum mechanics. We show that molecular-like 4-fold-lattice-oxygen coordinated metal sites on the ((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1) surface may very well be the key active sites in the electrocatalysis. The predicted OER overpotential (eta(OER)) for a Fe-centered pathway is reduced by 0.34 V relative to a Ni-centered one, consistent with experiments. We further predict unprecedented, near quantitative lower bounds for the eta(OER), of 0.48 and 0.14 V for pure and Fe doped beta-NiOOH((1) over bar2 (1) over bar1), respectively. Our hybrid density functional theory calculations favor a heretofore unpredicted pathway involving an iron(W)-oxo species, Fe4+=0. We posit that an iron(IV)-oxo intermediate that stably forms under a low coordination environment and the favorable discharge of Ni3+ to Ni2+ are key to beta-NiOOH's OER activity.									115	4	0	0	11	0	115			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000455561800089	30543110

We report an Ir-Co binary oxide electrocatalyst for OER fabricated by a multistep process of selective leaching of Co from Co-rich composite oxides prepared through thermal decomposition. The stepwise leaching of the Co component from the composites leads to the formation of macro- and mesoscale voids walled by a cross-linked nanoporous network of rod- and wedge-like building units of Ir-Co binary oxide with a futile phase structure and an Ir-enriched surface. In comparison, Ir-Co binary oxide with similar composition prepared by direct thermal decomposition method exhibits a loose nanoparticle aggregation morphology with a Co-enriched surface. The cross-linked porous Ir-Co binary oxide from selective leaching is about 3-fold more active for the OER than that from direct thermal decomposition. Compared with pure IrO2 from thermal decomposition, the Co-leached binary oxide is ca. two times more active and is much more durable during continuous oxygen evolution under a constant potential of 1.6 V, thus showing a possibility of reducing the demand of the expensive and scarce Ir in OER electrocatalyst for acidic water splitting.									68	1	0	0	3	0	69			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000340446300109	24984084

Here, a coordinative self-templated pseudomorphic transformation of an interpenetrated metal organic compound network is conceptualized into a defect-rich porous framework that delivers highly reactive and durable photo(electro)chemical energy conversion functionalities. The coordinative-template approach enables previously inaccessible synthesis routes to rationally accomplish an interconnected porous conductive network at the microscopic level, while exposing copious unsaturated reactive sites at the atomic level without electronic or structural integrity trade-offs. Consequently, porous framework, interconnected motifs, and engineered defects endow remarkable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity due to intrinsically improved turnover frequency, electrochemical surface area, and charge transfer. Moreover, when the hybrid is coupled with a silicon photocathode for solar-driven water splitting, it enables photon assisted redox reactions, improved charge separation, and enhanced carrier transport via the built-in heterojunction and additive co-catalyst functionality, leading to a promising photo(electro)chemical hydrogen generation performance. This work signifies a viable and generic approach to prepare other functional interconnected metal organic coordinated compounds, which can be exploited for diverse energy storage, conversion, or environmental applications.									111	5	0	0	6	0	111			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000454769900008

Elemental doping by partial replacing of parent metal elements with elements of higher electronegativity is considered to be one of the most efficient strategies to promote the electrocatalytic OER performance. In this work, we synthesize an efficient hierarchical highly wrinkled NiFeCu phosphide nanosheet on nanodendrite Ni3S2/NiF substrates through partial replacement of Cu instead of Ni and Fe in NiFeP@Ni3S2/NiF by using a facile electrodeposition method. The NiFeCuPpNi(3)S(2)/NiF electrocatalyst needs only 230, 282, and 351 mV to reach 10, 50, and 100 mA x cm(-2), respectively. Notably, this electrocatalyst shows one of the lowest OER overpotentials at 10 mA/cm(-2) for metal phosphides and endured the OER at 20 mA x cm(-2) for 18 h with negligible voltage elevation. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), double-layer capacitance (C-dl) plots, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy show that the partial Cu doping in NiFeP@Ni3S2/NiF not only can change the electron density around Ni and Fe but also can increase the electrochemically active surface area and conductivity of electrocatalysts.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000562182900049	32667189

The robust charging reversibility of the redox metal sites ensures long-term durability of the devices but remains unachieved and usually ignored. Here, we use in situ UV-vis and Raman spectroscopies to track the redox states of a nickel hydroxide Ni(OH)(2) model catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during its lifetime in strong alkaline media. We show that at 200 mAcm(-2) in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, the reversible redox states of the catalytically active Ni sites gradually disappear when the catalyst converts into an irreversible and inactive phase. We found that after deactivation, the complete reduction of such oxidized Ni sites can not be achieved until a very negative reduction potential around 0.1 V RHE was applied owing to the structural amorphization/disordering of the layered Ni(OH)(2) catalyst. Our results suggest that the deactivated and unreduced Ni sites hardly re-hydrate/re-hydroxylate and thus obstruct the OER process. These findings provide direct evidence for elucidation of the origin of the oxygen evolution decay and contribute to a reference to extend the lifetime of 2D-layered transition-metal hydroxide catalysts by stabilizing the reversible redox metal sites.									25	2	0	0	0	0	25			2155-5435			WOS:000563749900040

First-row transition-metal (Ni, Co, and Fe)-based compounds are promising candidates as OER catalysts to substitute the benchmark of noble-metal based catalysts, such as IrO2, and RuO2. Although Fe is the cheapest and one of the most abundant transition-metal elements, there are seldom papers reported on Fe-only compounds with outstanding catalytic OER activities. Here we propose an interesting strategy by growing iron nitride (Fe3N/Fe4N) based nanoporous film on three-dimensional (3D) highly conductive graphene/Ni foam, which is demonstrated to be a robust and durable self-supported 3D electrode for the OER featuring a very low overpotential of 238 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2), a small Tafel slope of 44.5 mV/dec, good stability, and 96.7% Faradaic yield. The high OER efficiency is by far one of the best for single-metal (Fe, Co, and Ni)-based catalysts, and even better than that of the benchmark IrO2, which is attributed to the fast electron transfer, high surface area, and abundant active sites of the catalyst. This development introduces another member to the family of cost-effective and efficient OER catalysts.									152	11	0	0	11	0	154			2155-5435			WOS:000395726500068

Replacement of Asp-9 resulted in a dramatic increase in proteolytic sensitivity leading to the degradation of the protein forming a 31 kDa fragment with an undefined N-terminus. This fragment was unable to restore oxygen evolution. However, the variants of the 33 kDa protein which remained intact could reconstitute oxygen evolution as effectively as the wild-type protein. Cross-linking experiments with a water-soluble carbodiimide revealed that mutagenesis of residue D9 led to the disruption of an intramolecular salt bridge. Therefore we suggest that the N-terminus of the 33 kDa protein is necessary for maintaining the binding ability of the protein to Photosystem II but might not be involved in binding itself.									17	2	0	0	15	0	19			0167-4412			WOS:A1996UZ23600019	8704153

This article intends to design photocatalysts of crystalline (amorphous) TiO2/two-dimensional MoS2 sandwich structure supporting singleatoms (SAs). After the effective mass, electrostatic potential, light absorption spectrum and other related properties were calculated, the analysis shows that catalysts with amorphous sandwich structure has excellent electron-hole separation ability, and precious metal SAs can adsord onto the amorphous sandwich structure stably. Except for the Pt@Amorphousr-TiO2/MoS2 sandwich structure single-atom catalysts (SACs), which is only active towards oxygen evolution, all the other interlayer catalysts are active for both photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution. copy 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-7608			INSPEC:21471211

We found that Ba(0.5)Sr(0.5)Co(0.8)Fe(0.2)O(3-delta) (BSCF) catalyzes the OER with intrinsic activity that is at least an order of magnitude higher than that of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalyst in alkaline media. The high activity of BSCF was predicted from a design principle established by systematic examination of more than 10 transition metal oxides, which showed that the intrinsic OER activity exhibits a volcano-shaped dependence on the occupancy of the 3d electron with an e(g) symmetry of surface transition metal cations in an oxide. The peak OER activity was predicted to be at an e(g) occupancy close to unity, with high covalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds.									3391	140	0	0	233	0	3424			0036-8075			WOS:000297787700047	22033519

The stability of different surface terminations as a function of oxygen partial pressure as well as pH and applied voltage is compiled in a Pourbaix diagram. The termination with octahedral Co and O ions (B-layer) is found to have the lowest overpotential of 0.46 V for an octahedral Co reaction site, associated with its p-type conducting character and the higher oxidation state of the active site (+4) during OER Furthermore, we systematically investigated the effect of Fe and Ni doping on the overpotential. Our results indicate that Ni doping at an octahedral site in the surface layer reduces the overpotential from 0.46 to 0.34 V. Likewise, Fe doping at an octahedral site at the tetrahedral Co termination (A-layer) lowers eta from 0.63 to 0.37 V with octahedral Co remaining in the active site. We note that the potential determining step changes from *OH (B-layer) to *<b>OOH formation (A-layer). While implicit solvation increases the overpotential by 0.2 V (B-layer) and 0.4 V (A-layer), which is attributed to enhanced binding energies of the intermediates, the general trends with respect to doping remain unchanged. The scaling relationship of the binding energies of *OOH and *OH is overall satisfied, with the doped systems lying close to the top of the volcano plot of the overpotential versus (Delta G*(b)(O) - Delta G*(b)(OH)). A further insight into the origin of this behavior is gained by analyzing the changes in oxidation states of surface ions and, in particular, the Co active site during OER.									28	1	0	0	0	0	29			2155-5435			WOS:000649106200060

The current requirement was dominated by oxygen reduction during the initial stage of polarization after application of cathodic protection. However, as the calcareous scale deposited. oxygen reduction reaction rate decreased and hydrogen evolution became the dominating cathodic process. Furthermore, the rate of hydrogen evolution appeared to become catalyzed by the presence of the calcareous scale deposit. At a given flow rate, a maximum was obtained when the Ca/Mg ratio measured in the calcareous deposit Was plotted as a function of applied potential. The maximum became larger and shifted to more active potentials with increasing flow rate, as determined by the pH and potential-dependent competing kinetics of calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH](2)) and magnesium hydroxide (Mg[OH](2)) deposition. The applied potential giving the maximum Ca/Mg ratio in the calcareous deposit provided the best protection and minimum current requirement at a given flow rate.									14	1	0	0	2	0	15			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000249363000007

However, few catalysts, except for noble metals, meet all the requirements. By using state-of-the-art density functional calculations, herein we demonstrate that 2D MXenes, like Ti2C, V2C, and Ti3C2, are terminated by a mixture of oxygen atoms and hydroxyl, while Nb2C and Nb4C3O2 are fully terminated by oxygen atoms under standard conditions [pH 0, p(H-2) = 1 bar, U = 0 V vs standard hydrogen electrode], findings in good agreement with experimental observation. Furthermore, all these MXenes are conductive under standard conditions, thus allowing high charge transfer kinetics during the HER. Remarkably, the Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of atomic hydrogen (Delta G(H)(0)*) on the terminated O atoms (e.g., Ti2CO2) is close to the ideal value (0 eV). Our results demonstrate terminated oxygens as catalytic active sites for the HER at these materials and highlight a family of promising two-dimensional catalysts for water splitting.									570	33	0	0	25	0	572			2155-5435			WOS:000391783200058

To supplement this research gap, several promising ethylenediamine derivatives were screened out. They are N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediamine, 1,2-propanediamine, and 1,2-cyclohexanediamine. These cobalt(II)-amine solutions are effective for denitration and have not been reported yet. However, they are also easily oxidized to the corresponding cobalt(III) species. In the presence of a nanocarbon material, cobalt(III) components are reduced to cobalt(II) components and release oxygen by reacting with acids. The effects of solution pH, temperature, and graphene dosage on the regeneration process were investigated. A proper addition of graphene as a catalyst contributes to the progress of regeneration. Catalytic mechanisms and regeneration performance have been discussed as much as possible. These mechanisms are related to the oxidation reactions and oxygenated species of cobalt complexes. The carbon material here acts as a catalyst for adsorbing cobalt chelates and accelerating charge transfer in the oxygen evolution reaction.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000491219800031	31518119

However, its poor cycle life and unacceptable energy efficiency from a high charging overpotential have been major limitations. Recently, much higher energy efficiency with low overpotential was reported for a new metal/oxygen system, Na/O-2 battery. This finding was unexpected since the general battery mechanism of the Na/O-2 system was assumed to be analogous to that of the Li/O-2 cell. Furthermore, it implies that fundamentally different kinetics are at work in the two systems. Here, we investigated the reaction mechanisms in the Na/O-2 cell using first-principles calculations. In comparative study with the Li/O-2 cell, we constructed the phase stability maps of the reaction products of Na/O-2 and Li/O-2 batteries based on the oxygen partial pressure, which explained why certain phases should be the main discharge products under different operating conditions. From surface calculations of NaO2, Na2O and Li2O2 during the oxygen evolution reaction, we also found that the minimum energy barrier for the NaO2 decomposition was substantially lower than that of Li2O2 decomposition on major surfaces providing a hint for low charging overpotential of Na/O-2 battery.									78	2	0	0	7	0	79			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000330543600022

Herein, an in situ and stepwise strategy for synthesizing core-shell Ni-3(S1-xSex)(2)@NiOOH (0 <= x <= 1) nanoarray heterostructures on nickel foam with tailored compositions for enhancing water-splitting performance is reported. A series of Ni-3(S1-xSex)(2) nanostructures is firstly grown on nickel foam via an in situ reaction in a heated polyol solution system. Ni-3(S1-xSex)(2)@NiOOH nanocomposites are subsequently prepared via electrochemical oxidation and the oxidation degree is systematically investigated by varying the oxidation time. Benefitting from the vertical standing architecture, abundant exposed active sites, and synergetically interfacial enhancement, Ni-3(S0.25Se0.75)(2)@NiOOH heterojunctions with electrochemical polarization for 8 h exhibit superior HER and OER behaviors, achieving a water-splitting current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 320 mV as well as boosted reaction kinetics and long-term stability. This work should shed light on the controllable synthesis of metal-based hybrid materials and provide a promising direction for developing the highest-performing electrocatalysts based on interfacial and heterostructural regulation for advanced electrochemical energy conversion technologies.									71	4	0	0	1	0	72			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000453627100017	30307691

The oxide powders were used to obtain thin films on nickel supports by painting with a slurry of the oxide followed by sintering at 400 degrees C. The films were satisfactorily adherent and porous. They have been observed to exhibit p-type semiconducting behaviour in the potential region -50 to +300 mV in 1 mol l(-1) KOH. Cyclic voltammetric study indicated the formation of a diffusion-controlled quasi-reversible redox couple (E degrees = 417 mV) prior to the onset of O-2 evolution at the oxide surface. It was found that Sr (or Ca) substitution enhanced greatly both the electrochemically active area as well the apparent electrocatalytic activity. The oxygen evolution reaction followed approximately first-order kinetics in OH- concentration, regardless of the nature of cobaltates. Values of the Tafel slope were 65 +/- 5 mV decade(-1) up to a current density of ca. 100 mA cm(-2). Sr- (or Ca-)substituted cobaltates were more active for oxygen evolution than those prepared by other methods.									49	0	0	0	0	0	50			0956-5000			WOS:A1995RD81700023

In this work, core@shell structured Ni@Fe-doped NiCo nanoparticles physically decorated on carbon nanotubes (Fe/Ni@NiCo-CNT) were synthesized through a facile low-temperature liquid reflux strategy. Electron microscope characterization evidenced a unique core@shell structure composed of a metallic Ni core and NiCo alloy shell with Fe element doping. Electrochemical measurements illustrated that the hybrid Fe/Ni@NiCo-CNT electrocatalyst showed superior ORR and OER activities, approaching and even exceeding those of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts. The about 4 nm-thick shell of the Fe-doped NiCo alloy combined with the synergetic effects between nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) made dominant contributions to increasing the electrochemically active surface area and accelerating electrocatalytic kinetics. When Fe/Ni@NiCo-CNT was applied in Zn-air batteries (ZABs), the primary ZABs delivered an open circuit potential of 1.427 V and a specific capacity of 796.5 mA h g(Zn)(-1). Moreover, the rechargeable ZABs surprisingly sustained for more than 1500 cycles with steady voltage polarization at 5 mA cm(-2). This cost-effective strategy shows important guidance for the structural engineering of other metallic alloy materials and further sheds light on developing efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts for renewable energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000808113500001

Cyclic voltammetric profiles of cerium-modified platinum surfaces obtained after potentiostatic or potentiodynamic procedures (applied in the true hydrogen evolution region) differ from those recorded after spontaneous methods. However, the catalytic effects are nearly the same on these cerium-modified platinum surfaces for methanol electrooxidation, i.e. lower onset potential values for the anodic reaction. Besides, a different electrocatalytic effect was observed at large positive potentials on methanol oxidation due to the cerium oxide capability of oxygen storage. This effect is observed on platinum modified by a drastic potentiostatic procedure (by applying -2.0 V) in cerium(IV) acid solution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the TPR/D study, CH2=CH-CH=CH2 is the sole product detected from the reaction of CH2=CHBr adsorbed on Cu(100) and featured by complex, coverage-dependent thermal desorption profiles (similar to 220-380 K). The preadsorbed oxygen can modify the evolution behavior of 1,3-butadiene from the CH2=CHBr reaction but has no influence on the main 1,3-butadiene formation at 265 K. Moreover, the surface oxygen participates in the CH2=CHBr reaction, forming an intermediate of >C=C=O, as well as additional products of H2O, C2H2, CO, and CO2, presumably via H-abstraction. New reaction pathways, which are otherwise not observed in the TPR/D study, are opened when CH2=CHBr impinges on Cu(100) at high temperatures. At 500 K, H-2, C2H2, and C2H4 are generated from the incident CH2=CHBr molecules upon Cu(100). The reaction of adsorbed CH3CHBr2 on Cu(100) only forms CH3CH=CHCH3 in TPR/D experiments. This product can be generated at the surface temperature as low as 120 K. Preadsorbed oxygen on Cu(100) can increase the 2-butene formation to 190 K, the peak temperature. An additional product of CH3CHO is also formed, but its amount is small. Apparently, preadsorbed oxygen on Cu(100) has different effects on the reaction pathways for the adsorbed CH2=CHBr and CH3CHBr2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447			WOS:000408598600046

Design Criteria for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts from First Principles: Introduction of a Unifying Material-Screening Approach								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				2	11			7991	8001		10.1021/acsaem.9b01480				NOV 2019	2019	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the bottleneck in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers as substantial overpotentials are required for the formation of gaseous oxygen at anode side to reach a satisfying current density. In the past years, substantial research investigations were dedicated to search for electrode materials with an ameliorated OER activity. Therein, different frameworks are proposed in the literature. The conventional method based on the computational hydrogen electrode approach relies on an assessment of simple binding energies by deriving linear scaling relationships that translate to a volcano plot at zero overpotential. Recently, the traditional volcano concept was extended, in that the applied overpotential and kinetics were accounted for by deducing overpotential-dependent volcano curves or kinetic scaling relations, respectively. An alternative framework corresponds to the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI), which was suggested as an improved measure within the search of potential OER electrocatalysts. Hitherto, there is no connection between these diverse methods, and it remains elusive which of these approaches is most suitable for material-screening purposes. On the example of the OER over transition-metal oxides, porphyrins, perovskites, metal oxides, and functionalized graphitic materials, a powerful combination of linear scaling relationships, kinetic scaling relations, overpotential-dependent Volcano plots, and ESSI is presented. While the computational costs for this unifying approach are the same as for the traditional volcano analysis, the inclusion of a single experimental input parameter in the underlying framework enables gaining unprecedented insights into catalyst design, thereby considering various aspects, such as binding energies, applied overpotential, decisive reaction intermediate, rate-determining reaction step, and catalytic symmetry. It is suggested to employ the concept of activity maps, as introduced in this contribution, for material-screening studies of multielectron processes in energy and environmental science.									37	0	0	0	1	0	37			2574-0962			WOS:000500038900033

Ionic liquids belong to new branch of salts with unique properties that have ever increasing applications in electrochemical systems especially lithium-ion batteries. For the first time, the effects of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (TBAHS) as an electrolyte additive in battery's electrolyte was studied on the hydrogen and oxygen evolution overpotential and anodic layer formation on lead-antimony-tin grid alloy of lead acid battery by using cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry in aqueous sulfuric acid solution. The grid surface morphology after cyclic redox reaction was studied by using scanning electron microscopy. The results show that, by increasing TBAHS concentration in the electrolyte, hydrogen and oxygen overpotential were increased, and so the crystalline structure of PbSO4 layer changed.

The physico-chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray-Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Particular efforts were addressed to tailor the crystallographic characteristics and the surface properties. The electrochemical properties were investigated in an electrolysis cell, based on Nafion 115 and 30% Pt/C as cathode catalyst, by using linear sweep voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel curves. The Ir(0.7)Ru(0.3)Ox-based electrocatalyst showed a performance of 3.2 A cm(-2) at 1.85 V at 90 degrees C which corresponds to a voltage gain of 0.1 V as compared to the IrOx catalyst at the same current density. Alternatively, an increase in current density of 0.6 A cm(-2) is achieved at 90 degrees C and 1.85 V for the IrRuOx anode. A similar Tafel slope with a decrease of charge transfer resistance for IrRuOx compared to IrOx would indicate the same mechanism for these materials and higher intrinsic activity for the mixed oxide.

The interlaced NiFe LDHs nanosheets consist of ultra-small gamma-NiOOH-like nanoparticles with size of 2-5 nm interconnected by amorphous domains. By tuning Fe content from 15% to 25% and 36%, optimized p.3.0 values (mu(10) is the overpotential required to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2)) of 169 mV (HER) and 140 mV (OER), and Tafel slope of 31 mV/dec have been achieved at x = 0.25. A hydrogen generation rate of 170 mu mol/h/cm(2) with H-2/O-2 ratio nearly to 2:1 and Faradic efficiency of 93% have been realized at 1.7 V by using two Ni0.75Fe0.25 LDHs/NF as respective anode and cathode in a 2-electrode system. Based on the valence state evolution of the electrodes, undergoing respectively H-2 and O-2 generation, tremendous transformation of NiFe(OH)(2) to NiFeOOH is deduced, which reaches a Ni3+/Ni2+ ratio of similar to 2.35 for the Fe content of 25%. Further or less Fe incorporation will depress the electrocatalytic property. The effective Ni3+ active sites on the NiFe-based nanosheets endow the Ni0.75Fe0.25 LDHs/NF with high bifunctional catalytic property. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Here, superlattice structured materials composed of CoNiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH)/ruthenium oxide nanosheets are synthesized as carbon-free electrocatalysts for OER. The positively charged CoNiFe LDH and negatively charged RuO2.1 are alternately stacked at the molecular level into superlattice-like hybrids by electrostatic interaction upon mixing their dispersions under suitable conditions. Such heterostructured composites are found to act as effective catalysts toward OER of water splitting with a small overpotential of 281 mV and Tafel plot of 48.9 mV/decade. Such composites also serve as efficient carbon-free cathode catalysts for aprotic Li-O-2 batteries with remarkable higher specific capacities and lower overvoltages than RuO2 nanoparticles. The superior performance may be attributed to the peculiar superlattice structure, resulting in strong interfacial electronic coupling, better electrical conductivity, and the suppression of side reactions caused by traditional carbon-based materials. Furthermore, potential difference between RuO2.1 and CoNiFe LDH nanosheets is observed directly by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy, indicating that electrostatic fields might be induced in the superlattice structures to benefit the transport of electrons and charged ions as well as the catalytic process.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000555417200088	32584016

Herein, we report a controllable synthesis strategy to fabricate high-performance 3D ternary CoMo-Ni metal-sulfide heterostructures only by one-step hydrothermal way. It is indicated that a series of CoxMoyS/NF consisting of MoS2 and CoNi2S4 active sites by optimizing the molar ratio of Co and Mo demonstrates various morphologies, capacitances and electrochemical performances. The obtained Co3Mo2-S/NF heterostructures exhibit superior OER performances in alkaline medium with the overpotential of only 106 mV to afford 20 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the catalyst presents the Tafel slope of 53.1 mV dec(-1) and good stability. Such excellent activities can be attributed to the distinctive 3D nanoneedles array with large electrochemical active areas, interwoven architecture with defect-rich features, high conductivity and the synergistic effect between MoS2 and CoNi2S4 species. This work demonstrates a facile and controllable pathway to synthesize multiple transitional metal-based chalcogenides as highly efficient OER catalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000632009200006

Binary NiOx/CoOx-modified electrodes (with NiOx initially deposited) show a high catalytic activity and a marked stability which far exceeds that obtained at the individual oxide-modified electrodes. This enhancement is demonstrated by a marked negative shift (more than ca. 600 mV) in the onset potential of the OER compared to that obtained at the unmodified electrodes. The modified electrodes show a significantly higher long-term stability, over a period of 5 h of continuous electrolysis, without any significant loss of activity towards the OER in alkaline medium. The influence of the solution pH, the loading level, and sequence of deposition of each oxide on the electrocatalytic activity of the modified electrodes is addressed with an aim to maximize the catalytic activity of the modified electrodes towards the OER. SEM imaging is used to disclose the size and morphology of the fabricated nano-NiOx and nano-CoOx binary catalysts at the electrode surface.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000314982200036

Herein, a novel bifunctional electrocatalyst with CoFe/Co nanoparticles encapsulated in N-doped carbon nanotubes/graphitic nanosheets (CoFe/Co@NCNT/NG) is prepared by a facile pyrolysis strategy. The in sits generated CoFe alloy itself, as well as its synergistic interplay with metallic Co and NCNT/NG, shows good electron and charge transfer capability, and the hybrids afford abundant active sites on the surface, stimulating greatly excellent intrinsic bifunctional catalytic features with a small ORR/OER potential difference of 0.735 V. Furthermore, CoFe/Co@NCNT/NG as the air electrode catalyst can endow rechargeable Zn-air battery (ZAB) with superior performance of exceptional open-circuit voltage of 1.40 V, high peak power density of 161 mW cm(-2). More importantly, CoFe/Co@NCNT/NG-based ZAB shows low charge-discharge voltage gap (0.819 V at 20 mA cm(-2)) and outstanding long-term galvanostatic charge-discharge cycle stability over 300 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2) with each cycle of 20 min, which outperforms the benchmark Pt/C + RuO2-based ZAB. Particularly, a CoFe/Co@NCNT/NG-based flexible rechargeable solid-state ZAB also displays reliable compatibility toward bending conditions.									40	2	0	0	4	0	40			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000003

By generating Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) two-dimensional homologous faults via simple control of the cation nonstoichiometry in LaNiO3 thin films, we demonstrate that strong tetragonal distortion of [NiO6] octahedra is induced by more than 20% elongation of Ni-O bonds in the faults. In addition to direct visualization of the elongation by scanning transmission electron microscopy, we identify that the distorted [NiO6] octahedra in the faults show considerably higher electrocatalytic activities than other surface sites during the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction. This unequivocal evidence of the octahedral distortion and its impact on electrocatalysis in LaNiO3 suggests that the formation of RP-type faults can provide an efficient way to control the octahedral geometry and thereby remarkably enhance the oxygen catalytic performance of perovskite oxides.									45	2	0	0	7	0	45			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000401307300056	28394129

PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				116	2-3	SI		189	214		10.1007/s11120-013-9863-9				OCT 2013	2013	In photosynthetic organisms, light energy is absorbed by a complex network of chromophores embedded in light-harvesting antenna complexes. In photosystem II (PSII), the excitation energy from the antenna is transferred very efficiently to an active reaction center (RC) (i.e., with oxidized primary quinone acceptor Q (A)), where the photochemistry begins, leading to O-2 evolution, and reduction of plastoquinones. A very small part of the excitation energy is dissipated as fluorescence and heat. Measurements on chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and oxygen have shown that a nonlinear (hyperbolic) relationship exists between the fluorescence yield (I broken vertical bar (F) ) (or the oxygen emission yield, ) and the fraction of closed PSII RCs (i.e., with reduced Q (A)). This nonlinearity is assumed to be related to the transfer of the excitation energy from a closed PSII RC to an open (active) PSII RC, a process called PSII excitonic connectivity by Joliot and Joliot (CR Acad Sci Paris 258: 4622-4625, 1964). Different theoretical approaches of the PSII excitonic connectivity, and experimental methods used to measure it, are discussed in this review. In addition, we present alternative explanations of the observed sigmoidicity of the fluorescence induction and oxygen evolution curves.									63	0	2	0	58	0	67			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000325848800006	23794168

At low oxygen coverage, a complex evolution of the enthalpy is observed mainly attributed to a chemisorption located on radical sites formed and accumulated during the outgassing pretreatment, whereas at higher coverage, the enthalpy becomes independent of the oxygen coverage where the removal of hydrogen as water vapour predominates. At low coverage the degassing pretreatments influence in a persistent way the enthalpy measurements, and in consequence it is generally only at high oxygen coverage, that enthalpy measurements coming from differently pretreated samples may be usefully compared.

Herein, we report a unique inverse opal framework hematite-based bi-functional catalyst for both EC and PEC water oxidation in alkaline media. Under the combined action of oxygen vacancies (Vo) and gold nanostars (AuNSs) on hematite, the catalyst exhibited excellent activity and stability on both EC and PEC. The composite showed superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Density functional theory (DFT) studies reveal that the coverage of Vo controls the D-band center of surface Fe sites, and the OER activity displays a volcano relationship with the Vo coverage. The addition of gold nanoparticles on the hematite with low Vo coverage improves the adsorption strength of oxygen-containing intermediates to the optimal point and increases the OER activity. Furthermore, the as-prepared photoanode exhibits a-3.13 fold increase in current (1.46 mA cm(-2)) at 1.23 V versus RHE. It is proposed that Vo promotes bulk conductivity and surface catalysis and exhibits reduced activation energy under high light intensity. AuNSs efficiently inhibits the bulk recombination and improves carrier concentration because of the Fermi level equilibration and plasmonic resonance, and the surface catalysis compensates the deterioration of interfacial recombination of carriers induced by Vo, playing a synergistic role.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000782175400005

The structure of the as-prepared (FeCrCoNiAl0.1)O-x films depends on the oxygen flow rate.

The as-prepared (Fe0.73Cr0.71Co0.78Ni0.81Al0.1)O-4.01 HEO film has an overpotential of 381 mV and shows an exceptional long-term electrolysis stability of 120 h in alkaline solutions at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis of the NiCo-(FeCrCoNiAl0.1)O-x heterojunction film formed by annealing (Fe0.73Cr0.71Co0.78Ni0.81Al0.1)O-4.01 at 700 degrees C is improved after 120 h of stability testing due to the synergetic effect between high-entropy oxide and NiCo. The present work not only provides a promising electrocatalyst but also broadens the application of high-entropy oxides. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Morphological investigation has been carried out by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which revealed the deposition of nano-MnOx in a nanorod morphology. A significant enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of the An, Pt and GC electrodes towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was observed upon the electrodeposition of nano-MnOx onto the aforementioned electrodes. The effect of the surface coverage of the manganese oxide and the pH of the electrolyte was investigated to seek an optimization. The highest cathodic shift in the onset potential of the OER was obtained in 0.5 M KOH irrespective of the substrate whereas the optimum loading (surface coverage) was about ca. 52%. The origin of the enhancement of the OER is addressed with the assistance of an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The preferential electrodeposition of crystal lographically oriented nano-MnOx (in the manganite phase, gamma-MnOOH) is thought to play the primary role in the observed enhancement.

In order to simultaneously address these concerns, an Ir/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces is deliberately designed as an efficient electrocatalyst system, with Ir nanoparticles (NPs) homogeneously confined on the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets. The strong electronic interaction and chemical bonding across the interface between the Ir and Ni(OH)(2) can effectively stabilize the metastable electrophilic Ir(V) species, which is vital to boost the formation of O-O bonds. Meanwhile, the adsorption of the multiple intermediates is synergistically optimized at the heterointerface, which breaks the restrictive scaling relation and substantially accelerates the OER kinetics. In addition, the severe agglomeration of Ir species is greatly mitigated by the confinement effect, ensuring the structural integrity of the catalyst and the constant exposure of active sites. Owing to its well-defined multifunctional interfaces, the Ir/Ni(OH)(2) heterostructure exhibits exceptional OER activity and durability in alkaline media. The present results highlight the significance of heterostructure interface engineering toward the rational design and development of advanced electrocatalysts for the OER and beyond.									137	3	0	0	9	0	137			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000529914900001	32363729

Electrocatalytic enhancement mechanism of cobalt single atoms anchored on different MXene substrates in oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions								ECOMAT										e12293	10.1002/eom2.12293		OCT 2022			2022	Decorating single atoms of transition metals on MXenes to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the resulting composites is a useful strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts, and the mechanisms behind this enhancement are under intense scrutiny. Herein, we anchored Co single atoms onto several commonly used MXene substrates (V2CTx, Nb2CTx and Ti3C2Tx) and systematically studied the electrocatalytic behavior and the mechanisms of oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER, respectively) of the resulting composites. Co@V2CTx composite displays an OER overpotential of 242 mV and an HER overpotential of 35 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, which is much lower than for Co@Nb2CTx and Co@Ti3C2Tx, making it comparable to the commercial noble metal Pt/C and RuO2/C electrocatalysts. The experimental and theoretical results point out that the enhanced bifunctional catalytic performance of CO@V2CTx benefits from the stronger hybridization between Co 3d and surface terminated O 2p orbitals which optimized the electronic structure of Co single atoms in the composite. This, in turn, results in lowering the OER and HER energy barriers and acceleration of the catalytic kinetics in case of the Co@V2CTx composite. The advantage of Co@V2CTx was further validated by its high overall water splitting performance (1.60 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2)). Our study sheds light on the origins of the catalytic activity of single transition metals atoms on MXene substrates, and provides guidelines for designing efficient bifunctional MXene-based electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000871456600001

The objective is to explore the reductions in computational thermodynamic overpotential that can be achieved relative to catalysis on metal oxide surfaces (OER) or platinum (ORR) by varying the metal center and axial ligand. This permits a degree of simultaneous control over the free energy gap between the lowest energy OH and highest energy OOH intermediates, and the position of the oxo (O) intermediate in this gap. Optimal choice of metal toward the right of the first transition series largely controls the gap. Given a suitable metal such as Fe, the overpotential for OER can be tuned over a range greater than 0.35 V by choice of the axial ligand. For OER occurring within the SWCNTs, a minimum predicted overpotential of 0.35 V is found, very close to the gap-imposed limit of 0.30 V for this system. Similarly, the overpotential of ORR can be tuned over a range more than 0.30 V by selection of the axial ligand. While the calculations necessarily have limited accuracy, the principles should provide a transferable path toward overpotential optimization for the OER and ORR.									25	2	0	0	2	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000347360200003

Hydrogen production by water electrolysis is an effective technology to store the intermittent electric power generated by large-scale renewable energy. To achieve high electricity-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are essentially required. Electrode catalytic materials for water electrolysis have complicated chemical composition and multi-level structure, of which the chemical-physical properties and morphology structure are the main factors that determine the performance of electrolysis of water. In this paper, combining the research works on water electrolysis catalysts of our group, the recent advancements in the area of HER and OER catalysts with emphasis on catalyst design and engineering are reviewed. The catalyst design theories based on reaction mechanism of electrolytic water, catalyst design methodology (including nanoarchitecture, crystal face regulation, support combination, phase adjustment, heteroatom doping, alloying and surface modification) and their applications based on catalytic performance have been introduced in the light of product requirements. According to the development and requirement of chemical product engineering, the key scientific problems and development direction of the catalyst design and product engineering from molecular level to micro-nano structure scale as well as product synthesis and application are further provided.									12	6	0	0	0	0	14			1005-281X			WOS:000425931300003

Two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) have made some advances in PEC water splitting owing to their functionalized building blocks, remarkable structural stability, and unique conjugated structures, etc. Unfortunately, the PEC performance of COFs is severely hindered because of the poor surface charge transfer, surface recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte junction, and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. Herein, we report an efficient 2D heterojunction through decorating a 2D COF with MoS2 for enhanced PEC water oxidation. The photocurrent density and incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the resultant photoanode are effectively improved by constructing 2D COF-based heterojunction. Such a strategy of constructing 2D heterojunction can not only efficiently accelerate the charge separation and transfer but also promote the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs for oxygen evolution. This work provides rational suggestions for developing COF-based photocatalysts to address the energy crisis and various environmental issues.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2213-3437		WOS:000743610900007

It is difficult for the homogeneous NiFe-LDH to take good care of the above requirements at the same time. Herein, we proposed an elaborate atmosphere corrosion strategy to construct porous NiFe-LDH with rich edge/surface-Fe defects on Ni foam (NF). Such edge/surface-Fe defects, mainly caused by the local unequal-stoichiometric ratio of Fe/Ni in the nanometer or subnanometer region, are determined by the unbalanced permeating of the acid vapor and the confined reaction of local Fe and Ni species ionized by the acid vapor. Benefiting from the abundant and fantastic edge/surface-Fe defects, the optimal NiFe-LDH prepared by atmosphere corrosion is more energetic for OER than that synthesized in conventional liquid phase, only a potential of 1.481 and 1.552 V-RHE to respectively achieve the current density of 100 and 1000 mA cm(-2) as well as a satisfactory stability and reproducibility. An overall water-splitting system assembled by inhomogeneous NiFe-LDH and commercial Pt-C can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at a solar cell of 1.72 V. Additionally, the atmosphere corrosion is very suitable for the large-scale, green, and economic synthesis of metal-based catalysts with high enrichment of defects, highlighting its potential for device and industrial applications.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000812148900059	35435674

Herein we describe a facile approach for accessing ruthenium dioxide films that produce high OER electrocatalytic activities in acidic media. Exposure of spin-cast ruthenium trichloride films on fluorine-doped SnO2-coated glass (FTO) substrates to near-infrared radiation, "near-infrared driven decomposition (NIRDD)", induces a thermal decomposition process that affords nanocrystalline ruthenium dioxide. In contrast, ultraviolet-driven-decomposition (UVDD) of the ruthenium precursor Ru(tmhd)(2)(COD) [tmhd = bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato); COD = 1,5-cyclooctadiene] affords an amorphous oxide film. The amorphous RuO2 films suffer from poor adhesion to FTO, whereas the nanocrystalline RuO2 films display electrochemical properties that match those exhibited by state-of-the-art RuO2-based OER electrocatalysts (eta similar to 360 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M H2SO4) and show stabilities that are consonant with crystalline films.									19	2	0	0	2	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395072800029

This peculiar hierarchical hybrid electrode also possesses excellent electrochemical stability and long-term durability at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium.

Unfortunately, currently available synthetic methods can hardly meet all these demands. Herein, we propose a facile and general approach for the rapid synthesis of ligand-free metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in low-temperature molten salts. Because of the low reaction temperature (<150 degrees C) and quick process (similar to 1 min), the as-prepared metal oxide NPs possess ultrasmall particle sizes (<15 nm), low crystallinity structures, and most importantly clean surface, making them highly desirable for heterogeneous catalysis. As a demonstration for how valuable the low-temperature molten salt approach is for catalytic 16 application, the as-prepared Ni-Fe-O-x NPs show outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (with a low overpotential of 226 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), placing them among the best OER electrocatalysts.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			2574-0962			WOS:000529190300096

To increase the efficiency of Cu-based electrocatalysts, efforts have been made to optimize the electronic structures and to create surface defects and hierarchical nanostructures with more exposed accessible active sites. Herein, we report a facile method for preparing CuO electrocatalysts with hierarchical nanostructures using the Cu-alanine complex as a precursor through room-temperature chemical precipitation and subsequent calcination in air. Investigations of products obtained at different calcination temperatures reveal the relationship between OER activities and the material characteristics such as specific surface areas, crystal growth orientations, and element components. The product obtained at 500 degrees C exhibits the smallest overpotential of 290 mV in 1.0 mol/L KOH for electrocatalyzing OER. Combining with various characterizations of CuO electrocatalysts after OER activities, the possible catalytic mechanism and the influence factors of their OER performance are also discussed.

Exciting advances have been achieved in exploiting high efficiency, low cost, and environmentally-friendly processes for recycling spent LIBs. Until now, recycling electrode materials of spent LIBs has focused on the recovery of valuable metal resources that can be reutilized for production of new batteries or functional materials (e.g., catalysts). For the catalyst synthesis from spent LIBs, hydrometallurgical processes have been widely employed for recovery of transition metals compared to pyrometallurgical processes. Particularly, the recovered transition metal oxides such as CoOx and MnOx or their composites have more impact on catalysis applications, especially in the eletro-and photo catalytic water splitting and organic pollutants degradation. Furthermore, the synthesis of transition metal based compounds (e.g., oxides, oxyhydroxides, borides, phosphides, sulfides, nitrides) from spent LIBs should be developed to improve their photo-electro-catalytic activities in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Additionally, the recovered transition metals can be used to improve the catalytic activity of other photo-catalysts (e.g., g-C3N4). "Waste-to-wealth " strategies of spent LIBs to catalysts would provide considerable benefits of environmental protection and functional materials synthesis in an efficient way.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000782299900001

This is, however, a formidable challenge that will demand a new capability to tailor the electronic structure. Here, an original electronic structure tailoring of CoO by Ni and Zn dual doping is reported. This changes it from an inert material into one that is highly active for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on combined density functional theory calculations and cutting-edge characterizations, it is shown that dual Ni and Zn doping is responsible for a highly significant increase in HER activity of the host oxide. That is, the Ni dopants cluster around surface oxygen vacancy of the host oxide and provide an ideal electronic surface structure for hydrogen intermediate binding, while the Zn dopants distribute inside the host oxide and modulate the bulk electronic structure to boost electrical conduction. As a result, the dual-doped Ni, Zn CoO nanorods achieve current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of, respectively, 53 and 79 mV. This outperforms reported state-of-the-art metal oxide, metal oxide/metal, metal sulfide, and metal phosphide catalysts.									195	22	0	0	9	0	197			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468005400011	30828895

The effects of powder particle size and reactive sintering temperature on formation of reinforcing phases and microstructural evolution have been investigated. The reduction reaction of TiO2 by molten Al has been proved to be a stepwise process. Four oxygen deficient titanium oxides can be formed and Ti2O3 was a main intermediate phase. In addition to the oxygen deficient titanium oxides, there also existed several transitional phases, such as AlB2, gamma-Al2O3, and Al3Ti. As the reinforcements in the composites, Al2O3 is formed by a series of aluminothermic reactions, while the formation of TiB2 depends on AlB2 transitional phase. AlB2 was gradually transformed to a mixed diboride (Al,Ti)B-2, and subsequently to TiB2, through displacement of Al in the metallic sublattice of AlB2 by Ti atoms. Small-sized TiO2 powder promoted the formation of the reinforcing phases at lower and the resultant reinforcing particulates exhibited smaller sizes. temperatures. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We report a facile strategy to prepare PtPd alloy embedded in nitrogen-rich graphene nanopores (Pt2Pd/NPG) as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for HER and ORR. The as-prepared Pt2Pd/NPG exhibits prominent onset potential, excellent stability, good kinetic current density, and remarkable corrosion resistance to HER and ORR. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the remarkably enhanced performance of Pt2Pd/NPG originated from the robust conjugation between the Pt2Pd alloy nanoparticles and nitrogen-rich graphene nanopores, thereby leading to the synergistic effect of both interfaces. The nanopores also modulate the electronic properties of Pt2Pd alloy nanoparticles, which improve the durability during HER and ORR. A novel approach for preparing high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts with embedded metal alloy in nitrogen-rich carbon is presented. The process has potential applications in energy conversion and storage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									75	2	0	0	2	0	75			0008-6223	1873-3891		WOS:000393249600084

However, the beauty of this concept is marred by the severe carbon evaporation and the aggregation of metal species during their synthetic process, leading to the diminishment in active sites and catalytic durability. To address this issue, this study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing Al2O3 nanolayer to trap volatile carbon and nitrogen species and alleviate the aggregation of Co species during the pyrolysis of the Zn/Co-ZIFs (ZIF = zeolitic imidazolate framework). With the confinement effect of an Al2O3 nanolayer, the derived Co3O4-embedded N-doped porous carbon grown on carbon cloth presents outstanding bifunctional catalytic activity with a small potential difference of 787 mV between the half-wave potential of the oxygen reduction reaction and an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of the oxygen evolution reaction. More impressively, an advanced flexible rechargeable zinc-air battery in all-solid-state configuration is assembled, which achieves the maximum power density of 72.4 mW cm(-3) and good cycling stability. The insights produced in this work will provide guidance for the rational design of metal/carbon hybrid catalysts and low-cost renewable energy systems.									120	9	0	0	2	0	120			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000449819500006	30259586

Re-initiation phenomenon of gaseous detonation induced by shock reflection								SHOCK WAVES				16	3			247	256		10.1007/s00193-006-0064-8				FEB 2007	2007	The two-dimensional, time-dependent, reactive Navier-Stokes equations including the effects of viscosity, thermal conduction and molecular diffusion were solved to reveal the wave evolution and chemical dynamics involved in the re-initiation process. The computation was performed for hydrogen-oxygen-argon mixtures at the low initial pressure (8.00 kPa), using detailed chemical reaction model. The results show that, the decoupled leading shock reflects on the right wall of the vertical branch. High temperature and pressure behind the reflected shock induce the generation of hot spots and local explosion. Therefore, the re-initiation of gaseous detonation occurs. In the re-initiation area, there exist very high OH concentration and no H (2) concentration. However, in front of reflected shock, there exist relatively high H (2) concentration and no OH radicals. Additionally, the shock-flame interaction induces RM instability. This results in the fast mixing between hot reacted gas mixture and the relatively cold unreacted gas mixture and accelerates the chemical reactions. However, the shock-flame interaction contributes much less to the re-initiation, in contrast with shock reflection. The transition of leading shock from regular reflection to Mach reflection happens during the re-initiation. The computed evolution of wave structures involved in the re-initiation is qualitatively agreeable with that from the experimental schlieren images.									12	2	0	0	5	0	14			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000243972500006

Such monodisperse hierarchical structure, distributed in diameter of around 2.76 -4.22 mu m, is constructed orderly with several well-aligned nanosheet subunits in a high degree of orientation and separation; moreover, the shell thickness and the void space can be adjusted by changing the concentration of the PVP surfactant. When applying as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the obtained CO3O4 delivered a low onset potential (e.g., around 1.438-1.481 V vs RHE) with a low overpotential (e.g., around 290-310 mV at 10 mAcm(-2)) and relatively small Tafel slopes (e.g., around 86 -97 mV dec(-1)) as well as long-term durability (e.g., up to 99.15% after 10 h) in an alkaline electrolyte. These fine catalytic activities can be attributed to the hierarchical structure with high specific surface area, ordered multilevel pores and void space, which facilitate the electrolyte accessibility and provide more active sites for redox reaction. Therefore, with the presented method, it would be promising for the synthesis of other transition metal oxides/hydroxides with such unique structure towards energy conversion and storage applications.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and IR spectroscopy characterized their bulk crystalline properties. Both techniques have confirmed that all oxides belong to the spinel family. Their surface properties were characterized by XPS yielding the Co3+/Co2+ surface ratio. The kinetics of the OER was investigated in 1 M KOH by means of steady state current-potential curves, obtained in the potentiostatic mode and by reaction order determination. The order of reaction ranging from 1.0 to 1.2, and the Tafel slopes ranging from 67 to 69 mV dec(-1) can be tentatively interpreted by a mechanism involving a Temkin type of electrosorption of OH intermediates associated with an electrochemical rate-determining step. Replacing progressively Co by Mn, the electrodes were increasingly electrocatalytically less active, surface Co3+ ions being the active sites, and making Co3O4 the most active in the series.									54	2	0	0	2	0	54			1293-2558			WOS:000082925100003

Successive addition of hydrogen atoms to CO and O-2 produces H2CO, CH3OH, and H2O2, H2O, respectively. At such low temperatures, some of hydrogen additions such as H + CO -> HCO proceed via tunneling reactions rather than thermally-activated reactions. Effective reaction rates and isotope effect of the tunneling reactions to produce HCO and H2O were measured. The surface of ASW was found to enhance the effective rate of hydrogen addition to CO at relatively higher temperatures, namely around 20 K.					26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions	JUL 22-28, 2009JUL 22-28, 2009	CRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global EducCRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global Educ	Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MIWestern Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI	4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1742-6588	1742-6596	*****************	WOS:000282024600044

Although spinel catalysts have been widely explored for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the role of two geometrical sites that influence their activities has not been well established so far. Here, we present more effective cobalt-zinc oxide catalysts for the OER than 'classical' Co3O4. Interestingly, the significantly higher catalytic activity of ZnCo2O4 than that of Co3O4 is somewhat surprising since both crystallize in the spinel-type structure. The reasons for the latter remarkable difference of ZnCo2O4 and Co3O4 could be deduced from structure-activity relationships of the bulk and near-surface of the catalysts using comprehensive electrochemical, microscopic and spectroscopic techniques with a special emphasis on the different roles of the coordination environment of metal ions (octahedral vs. tetrahedral sites) in the spinel lattice. The vital factors influencing the catalytic activity of ZnCo2O4 over Co3O4 could be directly attributed to the higher amount of accessible octahedral Co3+ sites induced by the preferential loss of zinc ions from the surface of the ZnCo2O4 catalyst. The enhanced catalytic activity is accompanied by a larger density of metal vacancies, defective sites and hydroxylation. The results obtained here clearly demonstrate how a surface structural modification and generation of defects of catalysts can enhance their OER performance.									135	0	0	0	5	1	134			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378716900036

EOW is usually generated by electrolysis of a dilute NaCl solution in a chamber with two cells separated by membrane, and is obtained from the anode side. But low current efficiency and short service life of the anode in EOW generators restrict the application of EOW. Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 anode was prepared by the improved Adams fusion method. The properties of Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 anode was investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and electrochemistry cyclic voltammetry (CV). The crystal type is rutile with (101), (002) and (301) crystal planes. A large number of cellular structures were observed on the surface of the anode, which greatly increased specific surface area of the anode. With increasing specific surface area, electric charge was enhanced to 0.4 mC, which was 2.65 times of pure IrO_2. Electrochemical characteristics of the anode surface, such as oxidation peaks at 1.0 V(Pt-OH) and 0.9 V(Ir3+/Ir4+) proved the formation of platinum iridium oxide. The activities of chlorine evolution and oxygen evolution were also studied through linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). Compared with IrO_2, chlorine evolution activity in unit apparent surface area increased significantly, but oxygen evolution activity decreased obviously. The slope of Tafel was 56.3 mV·dec~(-1) for chlorine evolution reaction (CER), and the mechanism was Volmer-Heyrovsky in which the rate controlling step was electrochemical desorption. The slope of Tafel was 126.6 mV·dec~(-1) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the rate controlling step was formation of surface hydroxide on the catalyst surface. Electrochemical surface structure and electrochemical performance of Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 oxide coatings in 1 g · L~(-1) NaCl solution were investigated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). CER activity of Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 was better than IrO_2, which was in agreement with previous research. In the actual EOW preparation, electrolysis efficiency and available chlorine content (ACC) of EOW on the Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 anode were much greater than IrO_2 anode under the same condition. The accelerated life of Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2 anode was 3.14 times of the IrO_2 anode and the performance of the anode was greatly improved, which favored its commercial use.			氧化电解水作为一种新型、高效、环保的杀菌剂,具有广阔的应用前景。但目前在氧化电解水制备过程中,其阳极电催化材料存在效率低和使用寿命短等问题。采用亚当斯融合法制备了Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2复合氧化物电极。通过XRD表征,其晶型为典型的金红石型结构。SEM结果表明虽然颗粒之间存在团聚现象,但是可以明显观察到大量蜂窝状结构存在,提高了催化剂的比表面积和电化学面积。进一步的CV表征证明了这一点,同时在CV图中表现出明显的铂铱复合氧化物结构的特征。利用LSV技术分别考察了Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2的析氯和析氧极化曲线,发现其单位表观面积上析氯活性明显提高,而析氧活性明显降低。计算表明Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2的析氯反应Tafel斜率为56.3 mV·dec~(-1),反应机理为Volmer-Heyrovsky机理,速控步骤为电化学脱附步骤;其析氧反应Tafel斜率为126.6 mV·dec~(-1),控速步骤为催化剂表面氢氧化物的形成。进一步电化学阻抗实验表明在1 g·L~(-1) NaCl溶液中, Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2析氯电催化活性优于IrO_2,这与前面研究结果一致。在此基础上,以Ir_(0.5)Pt_(0.5)O_2/Ti为阳极制备氧化电解水,在相同条件下,其有效氯含量明显优于IrO_2/Ti,同时电解效率也明显提高,强化试验寿命是IrO_2/Ti的3.14倍,大大提高了电极性能,有利于其商品化使用。						3	5	0	0	1	0	7			0438-1157			CSCD:5375616

In this work, g-C3N4/ITO/Co-BiVO4 Z-scheme composite in which g-C3N4 as HEP, Co doped BiVO4 as OEP and ITO nanoparticles as conductive mediator is designed and fabricated. Without using any sacrificial agents, the g-C3N4/ITO/Co-BiVO4 composite exhibits 4 times higher than the gC(3)N(4)/Co-BiVO4, with the H-2 and O-2 evolution rate of 95.41 and 40.23 mu mol g(- 1)h(-1) under full arc irradiation. The increase in photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the efficient carriers' separation and transport induced by solid-state mediator ITO nanoparticles. In this work, a novel insight into rationally constructing effective all-solid-state Z-scheme system for overall water splitting will be given.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773543000004

Morphological and compositional optimization on a macroscale achieved by assembling a bimetallic Co-Mo sulfide (CoMoS) heterostructure in a hollow-structured composite (H-CoMoS) gave the electrocatalyst an ability to conduct enhanced bifunctional activities for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Intrinsic electronic structure optimization on a microscale achieved by introducing a small amount of iron (Fe) into H-CoMoS (H-Fe-CoMoS) further improved its catalytic activity and stability. Electrochemical measurements revealed that this multiscale structural optimization promoted enhanced electrical conductivity and increased the number of electrochemical active sites on the H-Fe-CoMoS, leading to its remarkable electrocatalytic performance as a bifunctional catalyst for both HER and OER in alkaline media. The H-Fe-CoMoS showed overpotentials of 282 mV and 137 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively, which are comparable to the performance of the benchmark OER catalyst RuO2 and HER catalyst Pt/C.									75	2	0	0	2	1	75			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000560727700005

Compared to octahedral regulation, the synergistic regulation of both tetrahedral sites and octahedral sites can induce a higher intrinsic activity, which is because they possess improved electrical conductivity and facilitate the formation of highly active Co3+/Co4+ species during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000847499200001	36040062

Cases involving the absence or presence of hydrogen evolution, as in, respectively, copper and zinc deposition, were treated. The results show that the importance of the diffusion controlled oxygen reduction reaction on metal deposition current efficiency is considerably decreased at low electrolyte flow rates used industrially by separating the reactor with a membrane, thus preventing the oxygen formed at the anode from reaching the cathode. Further substantial gains are achieved if hydrogen evolution takes place in the reactor, allowing a very efficient desorption mechanism of dissolved oxygen, but the global effect on metal deposition current efficiency remains unfavorable. The influence of several parameters on dissolved oxygen concentration inside the reactor and metal deposition current efficiency, such as electrolyte how rate, mass transfer coefficient, current density and inlet electrolyte dissolved gases concentration (oxygen and hydrogen), is also discussed.

In this study, we report a selective leaching route to prepare small Co9S8 nanoparticles supported on nitrogen, sulfur codoped porous carbon nanosheets (Co9S8@PNSC) by pyrolyzing sheet-like Co(II)-coordinated thiourea-ethylenediamine-formaldehyde resin (Co-TEFR)/polydopamine (PDA) hybrids that are covered by silica shell layer, followed by removal of the silica and Co nanoparticles with NH4HF2 through a wet etching method. Consequently, the resultant Co9S8 @PNSC exhibits high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity and tiny Co9S8 nanoparticles, which are conducive to the maximal utilization of active sites, endowing remarkable oxygen electrocatalysis with a half-wave potential of +0.845 V for oxygen reduction reaction and a low overpotential of 314 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction. Besides, such composite also shows a considerable electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen generation. When applied in an assembled zinc-air battery, Co9S8@PNSC displays a high power-density (203 mW cm(-2)) and favorable cycling lifespan. The results from the present strategy may provide an exemplification in rational design and fabrication of carbon-based nanocomposite for high-performance multifunctional electrocatalysis.

Here, a series of cobalt-molybdenum alloy nanorods encapsulated in N-doped carbon shells (CoMo@NC) is synthesized via an in-situ carbonization-reduction method using CoMoO4 as the precursor. The high conductivity, strain-induced effect, and synergistic interactions between N-doped carbon and bimetallic cores endow the optimized catalyst with outperforming catalytic performances for HER and OER in alkaline solution with low overpotentials (98 mV for HER and 336 mV for OER at 10 mA cm-2), as well as high durability. The overall water splitting device using the CoMo@NC sample achieved at 800 celcius treatment (CoMo@NC-800) as bifunctional catalyst could possess a low voltage of 1.67 V to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and high durability. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the pyridinic-N atoms of graphene anchored on CoMo alloy nanoparticles can efficiently modulate the electronic structure to generate optimal free energy of hydrogen adsorption (-0.029 eV), suggesting excellent HER intrinsic activity. This work may provide a facile avenue to achieve multiple metallic alloy-based nanomaterials for boosting electrochemical water splitting performance.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0925-8388	1873-4669		WOS:000810048700001

Part I.: Synthesis and Characterization								TOPICS IN CATALYSIS				62	5-6			429	438		10.1007/s11244-019-01164-3				JUN 2019	2019	A novel route for obtaining iridium-based electrocatalysts supported on sub-stoichiometric titanium oxides for catalytic applications is presented. Chloride-free titanium oxide nanoparticles have been produced in a H-2/O-2-flame reactor using titanium (IV) tetraisopropoxide as precursor material. Fuel rich combustion leads to the formation of sub-stoichiometric titania (TiO2-x) with an increased number of oxygen vacancies and enhanced electrical conductivity. Subsequently, TiO2-x was dispersed in 2-propanol and spray coated on titanium substrate under argon atmosphere, forming a titania layer. This multilayered support system was decorated with iridium nanoparticles from an iridium-based electrolyte, applying an electrochemical method. This deposition technique leads to an optimized allocation of the electrocatalyst particles, adequate adhesion to the support and, furthermore, ensures the electrical conductivity from the deposited Ir particles via the TiO2-x coating towards the titanium substrate. Finally, this process generated electrochemically active electrodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic environment. The mean crystallite size of the iridium catalyst was determined from the X-ray diffraction patterns according to the Debye-Scherrer equation to be 11.4nm. Linear and cyclic voltammetry were performed in 0.5M H2SO4 on the iridium/titania/titanium samples and proved the electrochemical activity of the prepared system. The increased catalytic activity of the prepared iridium samples was indicated by a decrease of the Tafel slope for the Ti-PTL/TiO2-x/Ir in comparison to electrochemically oxidized iridium sample. At higher overpotentials, the calculated Tafel slopes (112mVdec(-1)) present greater values than commonly reported Tafel slopes for IrO2 based electrodes, revealing a different rate determining step for the OER.					4th International Symposium on the Catalysis for Clean Energy and Sustainable Chemistry (CCESC)4th International Symposium on the Catalysis for Clean Energy and Sustainable Chemistry (CCESC)	20182018		Bilbao, SPAINBilbao, SPAIN	6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1022-5528	1572-9028		WOS:000473213000002

The samples were prepared by carefully depositing pre-synthesized IrNi nanoparticles on the surfaces of the NiCo2O4 nano-flowers. Compared with bare NiCo2O4, IrNi, and IrNi/Co3O4, the IrNi/NiCo2O4 exhibited significantly enhanced electrocatalytic activity in the OER, including a lower overpotential of 210 mV and a higher current density at an overpotential of 540 mV. We found that the IrNi/NiCo2O4 showed more efficient electron transport behavior and reduced polarization because of its bimetal IrNi modification by analyzing its Tafel slope and turnover frequency. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic mechanism of IrNi/NiCo2O4 in the OER was studied, and it was found that the combined active sites of the composite effectively improved the rate determining step. The synergic effect of the bimetal and metal oxide plays an important role in this reaction, enhancing the transmission efficiency of electrons and providing more active sites for the OER. The results reveal that IrNi/NiCo2O4 is an excellent electrocatalyst for OER.									31	12	0	0	2	0	31			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000393885500003

Chemical fuels may be produced efficiently via electrocatalytic water splitting, which uses electric and solar power. The development of efficient anodic electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a greater concern of present energy research. Cerium oxide (CeO2) are promising electrocatalysts that exhibit outstanding OER but their reduced stability obstructs the practical application. A novel strategy was established to construct an effective catalyst of heteroatom(N, B, P and S) doped CeO2 matrix were prepared. Moreover, the doping of heteroatoms into the CeO2 matrix processes the improved electronic conductivity, reactive sites, increases the electrochemical catalytic activity, which enhances the water oxidation reaction. Consequently, well-suited alkaline electrolysers were brought together for water oxidation to ideal OER electrocatalytic activity. The OER activity of the electrocatalysts follows the order of S-CeO2 (190 mV@10 mA cm(-2)), Ne CeO2 (220 mV @10 mA cm(-2)), Pe CeO2 (230 mV @10 mA cm(-2)), BeCeO2 (250 mV @10 mA cm (-2)) and CeO2 (260 mV @10 mA cm(-2)) in 1 M of KOH. From the kinetics analysis, Tafel slope value achieved for catalysts CeO2, BeCeO2, PeCeO(2), NeCeO2 and SeCeO2 are 142 mV dec(-1),121 mV dec(-1), 102 mV dec(-1), 98 mV dec(-1) and 83 mV dec(-1) respectively. These results validate that the S-CeO2 electrode is prominent for OER performance with the requirement of cell voltage of 1.42 V at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. In addition, sulphur doped CeO2 relatively have excellent stability through chrono-potentiometric analysis lasting for 20 h. Although the heteroatoms doped CeO2 is acts as anode material, the preparation method is widespread, which will reduce the synthesis cost and streamline the preparation of electrode for OER. This research effort delivers a complete advantage for the development of robust, environmentally friendly and highly dynamic electrocatalysts for OER activity.

We revealed that zirconium doping would regulate the surface structures of CaTiO3 from smooth surface to characteristic nanosteps structures. This nanosteps structure with more exposed active sites accompanied by higher exposed surface area, oxygen vacancies and reduction ability, effectively promote the separation of photo-induced carriers, thus resulting in increased photocatalytic properties.

The Co3O4 facilitates the water dissociation and optimizes the hydrogen adsorption of Ag by introducing tensile strain and low coordination number, resulting in a low HER overpotential of 51 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the electron transfer from Co3O4 to Ag facilitates the oxidization of Co3O4 and improves the OER performance, leading to a low OER overpotential of 206 mV at 10 mA cm(-2).

Self-supporting NiSe2/CFF is a bifunctional active material with outstanding supercapacitive behavior and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. For supercapacitors, the NiSe2/CFF electrode material has a specific capacitance (Cs) of 1125.4 F-1 (1 A g(-1)) and capacitance retention of about 97.4% (50,000 cycles). Furthermore, the flexible asymmetric supercapacitor (FASC) assembled used NiSe2/CFF electrode as cathode exhibited an excellent cycle life (89% retention after 20,000 cycles). In terms of OER electrocatalysis, NiSe2/CFF material shows lower Tafel slope (54.4 mV de(-1)), an overpotential (144.7 mV), and remarkable cycling activity. The NiSe2/CFF materials synthesized in this study show attractive potential for practical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000854735000001

Herein, we report an enhanced balance between activity, stability, and conductivity of nanoporous IrRe thin films fabricated by selective etching of Re. The nanoporous IrRe thin film exhibited a 35 times higher activity-stability factor compared to the polycrystalline Ir due to its increased electrochemical active surface area and reconstructed structures by electrochemical dealloying of Re from IrRe. Furthermore, higher catalytic activities than the state-of-the-art nanoparticle IrO2 catalysts were achieved because of their higher electronic conductivity due to a unique morphology of a metallic core and an oxide shell. We highlight that the electrochemical dealloying is a promising approach to improve the catalytic performances simultaneously.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800125

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been recognized as potential candidates for the formation of promising catalysts. In this study, we report the formation of Ni/CNT/CoNi using bimetallic-ZIF (CoNi-ZIF) as a precursor. Bimetallic CoNi encapsulated in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was obtained by calcinating CoNi-ZIF-67 to yield CNT/CoNi. The resulting CNT/CoNi was highly porous with a significant specific surface area of 242 m(2)/g. After calcination, Ni deposition on the CNT was performed and the surface area was reduced to 168.7 m(2)/g. Ni/CNT/CoNi was applied as a cathode material in zinc-air batteries, exhibiting excellent electrochemical performance and cycling stability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

HDMs combine the low- and high-dimensional features and are a new class of promising functional materials toward electrochemical reactions. We reported a hierarchical-dimensional cobalt hydroxide nanosheet assembly for electrocatalytic water oxidation. The assembling is 1D-oriented, the substructures are 2D nanosheets, and 3D voids are created in the material. The as-prepared material achieved superior electrocatalytic activity than isolated substructures. The better performance is associated with the improved mass transport, which is demonstrated by the analysis of kinetic-controlled currents. This protocol can also be applied in preparing efficient catalysts on the surface of industrial current collectors. The proposed concept of HDMs might open a new area of functional materials in heterogeneous electrocatalysis.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000517212500013

In this work, in situ surface X-ray scattering measurements combined with density functional theory (DFT) were used to determine the surface structural changes on single-crystal RuO2(110) as a function of potential in acidic electrolyte. The redox peaks at 0.7, 1.1 and 1.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) could be attributed to surface transitions associated with the successive deprotonation of -H2O on the coordinatively unsaturated Ru sites (CUS) and hydrogen adsorbed to the bridging oxygen sites. At potentials relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an -OO species on the Ru CUS sites was detected, which was stabilized by a neighboring -OH group on the Ru CUS or bridge site. Combining potential-dependent surface structures with their energetics from DFT led to a new OER pathway, where the deprotonation of the -OH group used to stabilize -OO was found to be rate-limiting.									185	3	0	0	9	0	186			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000417255900015

Recent measurements on semiconducting oxides have found a power law dependence of the OER rate on surface hole density, suggesting a multihole mechanism. In this study, using transient photocurrent measurements, density functional theory simulations and microkinetic modelling, we have uncovered the origin of this behaviour in haematite. We show here that the OER rate has a third-order dependence on the surface hole density. We propose a mechanism wherein the reaction proceeds by accumulating oxidizing equivalents through a sequence of one-electron oxidations of surface hydroxy groups. The key O-O bond formation step occurs by the dissociative chemisorption of a hydroxide ion involving three oxyl sites. At variance with the case of metallic oxides, the activation energy of this step is weakly dependent on the surface hole coverage, leading to the observed power law.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2520-1158			WOS:000870104400005

It is worth mentioning that the optimal iron concentration was 1.5 mmol and the suitable calcination temperature was 300 degrees C for 1 h in the Ar atmosphere. The as-prepared CoMnFeO4 showed outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance in an alkaline medium with low overpotentials of 242 and 331 mV at a Tafel slope of 102 my dec(-1) to deliver current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm(-2). The enhanced OER performance can be ascribed to the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity, which resulted from the porous nickel foam substrate, excellent structural stability, and the synergetic effect of multications in the trimetallic catalyst, low solution resistance, fast electron transportation, and efficiently exposed active sites.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000830799100001

The Stern layers formed at the interfaces of RuO2 (110) and (100) are compared to the previously reported Stern layer on Pt (111) [Liu et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 9 (2018) 1265]. While the Cs+ density profiles at the potentials close to hydrogen evolution reactions are similar, the hydration layers intervening the surface and the Cs+ layer are significantly denser on RuO2 surfaces than that on Pt(111) surface, reflecting the oxygen termination of RuO2 surfaces. The overall similarities between Stern layers on ruthenium surfaces and platinum surface suggest the universal presence of Stern layers in all well-defined solid-electrolyte interfaces.

So far, researchers have performed many staged studies, for example, on the independent oxygen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction, to focus on these key steps and strengthen specific characteristics, including photoresponse, energy carrier separation, and transfer. Noteworthy performance has been obtained for almost every stage. However, recent pioneering works have demonstrated that staged research cannot always be easily pieced together. Here, recent advances in standalone systems are collected and reviewed. We focus on the critical assessment of the key components requiring improvement. In addition, the opportunities for hybrid systems of photocatalysts with photothermocatalysts and photovoltaics with electrocatalysts are assessed. This review aims to discuss the direction of standalone solar carbon fuel production and potential knowledge transfer to intersecting fields.									16	2	0	0	1	0	16				2666-3864		WOS:000658749000007

After applying suitable biaxial tensile strains, the overpotentials of CoO2, FeO2 and VTe2 monolayers are reduced over 40%. In particular, the overpotentials of CoO2 and VTe2 monolayers decrease to 0.372 V and 0.491 V under the biaxial tensile strains of 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively, which are comparable to the reported overpotentials of noble metal and low-dimensional materials. Tensile strains modify the potential determining step for the OER and enhance the catalytic activity of metal atoms of magnetic 2D monolayers.

Herein, we reported the synthesis of N-doped CoS2 through a facile method using ammonium hydroxide as the N source, the subjection of N-doped CoS2 as efficient electrocatalysts for OER, and the identification of intrinsic activities by exploring the composition and electronic configurations and their correlations with the electrochemical performance. The DFT studies evidenced that N doping could alter the electronic density of the adjacent Co atoms and thus form well-defined electronic configurations for adsorption of intermediates. Specifically, the N-enriched CoS2 afford a small overpotential of 240 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term durability, endowing these N-doped materials to be ideal (but not limited to) OER electrocatalysts.									139	10	0	0	5	0	140			2155-5435			WOS:000402851600063

Developing highly efficient photoanodes to enhance the kinetics of the rate-determining oxygen evolution reaction is generally regarded as the key to achieve artificial photosynthesis. Recently, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) has emerged as a promising photoanode material for PEC applications. In this Review, recent progress in designing BiVO4-based photoanodes is presented and summarized, including morphological control, heteroatom/defect doping, hetero-/homo-junction fabrication and co-catalyst deposition. In addition, typical unbiased tandem devices of photoanode/photocathode and photovoltaic/photoanode systems using BiVO4 as the front-absorber photoanodes are reviewed.

The presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate in the deposition electrolyte leads to a slight inhibition of the deposition of lead dioxide. It has been found that the morphology and structure of composite materials differs significantly from lead dioxide. With an increase in the additive content in the composite, there is a transition from large-grained deposits to materials with submicron and nano-sized crystals. It is shown that anionic surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate in particular, are included in the growing lead dioxide. The changing in deposition conditions (temperature, pH and anodic current density) allows one to control the content of surfactant in the resulting oxide. It is possible to obtain a surfactant-oxide composite with the content of organic substance in the oxide up to 5.4 wt%. The electocatalytic activity of the materials involved was investigated in respect to oxygen evolution reaction and the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. Oxygen overpotential on PbO2-SDS coatings decreases in comparison to non-modified sample because of a decrease in the degree of filling of oxygen-containing particles on the surface of the electrode, probably due to blocking by sulfate ions. The 4-chlorophenol oxidation rate is significantly increased on PbO2-SDS composites. Thus, already after 90 min of electrolysis on composites, contained 2 and 4.2 wt% SDS, all aromatic intermediates are destroyed, and only aliphatic acids are found in the solution.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000589178000031		
J	Li, Yichuan; Tang, Guoqiang; Wang, Yu; Chai, Yongming; Liu, Chenguang								Interfacial Engineering of a Phase-Controlled Heterojunction for High-Efficiency HER, OER, and ORR Trifunctional Electrocatalysis								ACS OMEGA				7	16			13687	13696		10.1021/acsomega.1c07251				APR 26 2022	2022	The development of low-cost and high-performance electrocatalysts for simultaneously boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is highly crucial but still challenging. Herein, a facile one-step solid-phase polymerization and confined pyrolysis strategy is developed for scalable synthesis of a FexP/Fe3C-based (x = 1, 2) heterojunction with controllable iron phosphide crystal phases. By effective heterojunction interface regulation, the strong synergic effect between FeP/Fe3C and N- and P-codoped carbon (NPC) modified the electronic structure, resulting in an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the HER, OER, and ORR synchronously. Typically, the FeP/Fe3C@NPC catalyst exhibits efficient HER activity with a low overpotential of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER (97 mV) and OER (440 mV) and a high half-wave potential of 0.87 V for the ORR, as well as excellent stability in alkaline media. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that Fe3C can promote the activation of water molecules, while FeP is beneficial to the removal of H-2 and the FeP/Fe3C heterojunction can facilitate both Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in the HER process simultaneously. Moreover, FeP has a stronger inhibitory effect on OH adsorption, revealing that the FeP/Fe3C heterojunction also shows a better promoting effect for both the OER and ORR, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2470-1343			WOS:000812553500001	35559160

In this work, three-dimensional flower-like bimetallic Ni-Fe selenide electrocatalysts were successfully fabricated on nickel foam by a facile one-step chemical bath method. Benefiting from the bimetal synergistic effect of Ni/Fe bimetal and a large electrochemically active surface area provided by the unique three-dimensional flower-like structure and improved conductivity of metal selenides, the as-prepared Ni0.2Fe0.8Se-Se/NF exhibits good OER activity, that is, a small overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 57.7 mV dec(-1), and high stability of 26 h in 1.0 M KOH. The work may provide a new idea to fabricate other transition-metal-based catalysts for efficient water splitting.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000826303600001

This work first introduces a novel method to fabricate a bimetallic MOF glass, through melt-quenching of the cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [ZIF-62(Co)] with an adsorbed ferric coordination complex. The high-temperature chemically reactive ZIF-62(Co) liquid facilitates the formation of coordinative bonds between Fe and imidazolate ligands, incorporating Fe nodes into the framework after quenching. The resultant Co-Fe bimetallic MOF glass therefore shows a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance. The novel bimetallic MOF glass, when combined with the facile and scalable mechanochemical synthesis technique for both discrete powders and surface coatings on flexible substrates, enables significant opportunities for catalytic device assembly.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000722276400001	34694675

CoO/TiN nanowires array as an effective self-supported catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS LETTERS				279						128494	10.1016/j.matlet.2020.128494				NOV 15 2020	2020	A nanowires array with CoO/TiN heterostructure has been constructed and applied as the binderand conductive-agent-free anode for oxygen evolution reaction. A well-aligned CoO/TiN nanowires composite array was obtained by electrodeposition and subsequently thermal treatment. Such an anode reveals overpotential of 270 mV at current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is much lower than comparison catalysts. Moreover, CoO/TiN catalyst exhibits good stability which can maintain the vast majority of OER activities (more than 90% of initial current densities) for a 15 h long-termed chronoamperometry test. The enhanced performance should be attributed to the synergistic effect of heterostructure and advantages of the well-aligned CoO/TiN nanowires morphology which could largely increase the amount of contact areas between electrolyte and active sites.

The LiMO2 oxides offer the possibility of investigating the influence of the number of d electrons on OER by tuning the oxidation state of M via chemical or electrochemical delithiation. Accordingly, we investigate here the electrocatalytic behavior of LiNi0.7Co0.3O2 and LiNi0.7Co0.2Fe0.1O2 before and after chemical delithiation. In addition to varying the oxidation state of the transition-metal ions, we find that chemical delithiation also affects the local chemical environment and morphology. The electrochemical response differs depending on whether the delithiation occurred ex situ chemically or in situ during the electrocatalysis. The results point to the important role of in situ transformation in LiMO2 in alkaline electrolytes during electrocatalytic cycling.									19	2	0	0	4	0	20			1948-7185			WOS:000362391000002	26722871

We focused on one of its issues - the lack of a suitable support material for the anode electrocatalyst. TaC and NbC were studied as possible electrocatalyst supports for the PEM water electrolysis. Resistance to oxidation of the TaC and NbC was investigated by exposing them to air at 84 and 150 degrees C. Subsequently, their electrical conductivity was measured as the indicator of oxidation. Change in specific surface area and conductivity was measured after different periods of ball milling. We found that the TaC was significantly more resistant to oxidation than the NbC. Eventually, both materials retained relatively high electrical conductivity even with the oxidized surface. TaC can thus be recommended as an electrocatalyst support for the oxygen evolution reaction and both materials are proposed to be tested as alternative electrocatalyst supports for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Herein, we report the synthesis of electrocatalytically active, nickel foam-supported, spherical core-shell Fe-poly(tetraphenylporphyrin)/Ni-poly(tetraphenylporphyrin) microparticles (FeTPP@NiTPP/NF). We also show that FeTPP@NiTPP/NF exhibits efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic properties toward both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical tests in KOH solution (1 M) reveal that FeTPP@NiTPP/NF electrocatalyzes the OER with 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 302 mV and the HER with 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 170 mV. Notably also, its catalytic performance for OER is better than that of RuO2, the benchmark OER catalyst. Although its catalytic activity for HER is slightly lower than that of Pt/C (the benchmark HER electrocatalyst), it shows greater stability than the latter during the reaction. The material also exhibits electrocatalytic activity for overall water splitting reaction at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a cell voltage of 1.58 V, along with a good recovery property. Additionally, the work demonstrates a new synthetic strategy to an efficient, noble metal-free-coordinated covalent organic framework (COF)-based, bifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting.

Operando Identification of the Reversible Skin Layer on Co3O4 as a Three-Dimensional Reaction Zone for Oxygen Evolution								ACS CATALYSIS				12	6			3256	3268		10.1021/acscatal.1c05169				MAR 18 2022	2022	Co oxides and oxyhydroxides have been studied extensively in the past as promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in neutral to alkaline media. Earlier studies showed the formation of an ultrathin CoOx(OH)(y) skin layer on Co3O4 at potentials above 1.15 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), but the precise influence of this skin layer on the OER reactivity is still under debate. We present here a systematic study of epitaxial spinel-type Co3O4 films with defined (111) orientation, prepared on different substrates by electrodeposition or physical vapor deposition. The OER overpotential of these samples may vary up to 120 mV, corresponding to two orders of magnitude differences in current density, which cannot be accounted for by differences in the electrochemically active surface area. We demonstrate by a careful analysis of operando surface X-ray diffraction measurements that these differences are clearly correlated with the average thickness of the skin layer. The OER reactivity increases with the amount of formed skin layer, indicating that the entire three-dimensional skin layer is an OER-active interphase. Furthermore, a scaling relationship between the reaction centers in the skin layer and the OER activity is established. It suggests that two lattice sites are involved in the OER mechanism.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000778789200001	35359579

However, the low mass activity of noble Pt urgently needs to be improved due to the strong binding energetics of oxygen species (*O) with Pt sites. Here we report fine PtxSr alloy (similar to 2 nm) supported on N-doped carbon (NC) pyrolyzing from ZIF-8 as bifunctional electrocatalysts toward ORR and HER in acidic media. The representative Pt2Sr/NC exhibits an onset potential of 0.94 V vs. RHE and half-wave potential of 0.84 V toward ORR, and a low over-potential of 27 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) toward HER, respectively. Significantly, the mass activities of Pt2Sr/NC are 6.2 and 2.6 times higher than that of Pt/C toward ORR (at 0.9 V) and HER (at -30 mV), respectively. Simultaneously, Pt2Sr/NC possesses a retention rate of 90.97% toward acidic ORR after 35000 s of continuous operation. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the incorporation of Sr into Pt forming Pt2Sr alloy redistributes the electronic structures of Pt-Pt bonds, changing the rate-determining step for the ORR on Pt sites from the formation of *OH from *O to the generation of *OOH along with decreasing the energy barrier, which is also confirmed by the downshift of d band center. Meanwhile, the downshift of d band center also leads to the optimization of the adsorption energy (H*) with Pt, significantly improving Pt2Sr/NC toward HER.

Herein, we report the facile synthesis of a highly active electrocatalyst towards alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which involves a joint application of composition modulation, nanostructuring and defect engineering strategies to address the three key issues. A 3D hierarchically nanostructured Ni2-xMoxP/NiMoO4-y catalyst is synthesized using hydrothermal in combination with phosphorization methods. Phosphorization treatment of the ammonium nickel molybdate precursor results in the concurrent formation of highly dispersed Mo-doped Ni2P nanoparticles and oxygen-defect-rich NiMoO4-y substrate, which work in concert to provide synergistic active sites for alkaline HER. The presence of abundant oxygen-vacancies in NiMoO4 lattice leads to significant improvement of electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the nanoporous hierarchical structure of the catalyst promises abundance of accessible active sites and an improved reactant/product mass transfer kinetics. As a consequence of the favorable combination of these attributes, the non-precious Ni2-xMoxP/NiMoO4-y catalyst exhibits an intriguing catalytic performance towards the HER in alkaline solution, with an overpotential of similar to 36 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), which are among the best reported values of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.									25	3	0	0	1	0	25			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000501401900018

Ultrathin NiO nanosheets on the nickel foam cross-linked to each other are used as the core, and tiny NiMoO4 nanosheets are further engineered to be immobilized uniformly on the NiO nanosheets to form the shell. This step-by-step construction of the architecture composed of ultrathin primary and secondary nanosheets efficiently avoids the agglomeration problems of individual ultrathin nanosheets. The ingenious architecture possesses the advantages of numerous diffusion channels for electrolyte ions, ideal pathways for electrons, and a large interfacial area for electrochemical reaction. The introduction of the NiMoO4 secondary nanosheets on the NiO primary nanosheets not only endows the heterostructure with high electrical conductivity and a large active area but also promotes an increase in oxygen vacancy content, which favors the improvement of electrocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction. The Tafel plot for the NiO@NiMoO4 core-shell architecture is as low as 32 mV dec(-1), and the overpotential needed to reach 10 mA.cm(-2) for NiO@NiMoO4 nanosheets is only 0.28 V.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000469304700022	31067045

Specifically, the hydrogen generation rate over single site Ru-1/CeO2 catalyst is up to 9360 mol H-2 per mol Ru per hour (579 mL(H2) gRu(-1) s(-1)) with 99.5% CO2 selectivity. Reaction mechanism study showed that the integration of metal single site and O vacancies facilitated the tandem reaction, which consisted of methanol dehydrogenation, water dissociation, and the subsequent water gas shift (WGS) reaction. In addition, the strength of CO adsorption and the reaction activation energy difference between methanol dehydrogenation and WGS reaction play an important role in determining the activity and CO2 selectivity. Our study paves the way for the further rational design of single site catalysts at the atomic scale. Furthermore, the development of such highly efficient and selective hydrogen evolution systems promises to deliver highly desirable economic and ecological benefits.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000684581100024	34328729

In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and galvanodynamic measurements in combination with a physics-based model are used to determine the kinetic parameters of the hydrogen oxidation reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction on Pt/C porous gas-diffusion electrodes in an AEMFC. Two semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plot of a symmetrical AEM hydrogen cell, indicating a two-step reaction pathway. The fit of the model shows that the Tafel-Volmer pathway describes the kinetics better than the Heyrovsky-Volmer pathway. The reaction rates of the adsorption and charge transfer steps are similar in magnitude implying that both need consideration during modeling and evaluation of the hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the performance is limited also by the ionic conductivity in the electrode. Comparison of the impedance of the HOR and a hydrogen/oxygen AEMFC indicates that the low-frequency semicircle is mainly associated with the oxygen reduction reaction and the cathode, while the high-frequency semicircle is likely related to a combination of the anode and the cathode. Based on this work, a platform for further studies of losses and total impedance of operating AEMFC has been created.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000625975300001

The Co-NC possesses interconnected NiCo2O4 nanorods grown over a Co3O4 nanosheet structure, which facilitates charge transfer and enhances the electrical conductivity. Moreover, the 3D structured hybrids are directly used as a cathode catalyst for the Li-O-2 system and displayed a maximum in-depth-specific discharge capacity of 4386 mA h g(-1). In addition, significantly improved and stable cycling performance up to 60 cycles is observed compared with Co3O4 nanosheets at the limited capacity range of 500 mA h g(-1). The excellent electrochemical performance of the NiCo2O4@Co3O4 hybrid is mainly associated with the oxygen-deficient 3D architecture providing more catalytic active sites and can accommodate more discharge products. Further, ORR/OER activities of NiCo2O4@Co3O4 hybrid in aqueous media are also evaluated in 0.1 M KOH solution using the rotating ring disk electrode technique. For instance, the OER activity of NiCo2O4@Co3O4 hybrid (apex current is 4.18 mA cm(-2)) is an approximately 2.25 times higher than that of commercial RuO2 catalyst (1.84 mA cm(-2)). Since the catalytic activity in aqueous and organic medium is not necessarily the same, but of NiCo2O4@Co3O4 hybrid exhibiting excellent ORR/OER characteristics in both cases is worth mentioning.

Despite previously reported entropy-driven stabilization mechanisms, many high-entropy materials still tend to decompose to produce a variety of derivatives under operating conditions. In this study, we use transition-metal (Ni, Co, Ni, Zn, V)-based high-entropy metal-organic frameworks (HE-MOFs) as the precursors to produce different derivatives under acidic/alkaline treatment. We have shown that HE-MOFs and derivatives have shown favorable kinetics for N-2 electrofixation in different pH electrolytes, specifically cathodic nitrogen reduction reaction in acidic media and anodic oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. To buffer the pH mismatch, we have further constructed an asymmetric acidic/alkaline device prototype by using bipolar membranes. As expected, the prototype showed remarkable activities, with an NH3 yield rate of 42.76 mu g h(-1) mg(-1), and Faradaic efficiency of 14.75% and energy efficiency of 2.59%, which are 14.4 and 4.4 times larger than those of its symmetric acidic and alkaline counterparts, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2637-9368		WOS:000868697300001

The layered double hydroxides (LDHs) play an important role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Combining with some two-dimensional (2D) materials with high surface area and electrical conductivity can greatly improve the performance of water oxidation. Herein, we report a composite material that FeCo layered double hydroxides (FeCo-LDHs) were combined with single layer MXene (Ti3C2Tx). The single-layer MXene takes full advantage of the more active sites, reflecting higher electrochemical activity than other forms of MXene (nanofiber and multilayer). The resulting FeCo-LDH/MXene hybrid provides high electron transfer ability and electrochemically active surface area, leading to an enhancement of catalytic activity and durability for OER. An extremely low overpotential of 268 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) was achieved, which was lower than Graphene or MWCNT combined with FeCo-LDH.									33	1	0	0	1	0	33			2199-692X			WOS:000498450400001

It is shown that this pro. le depends strongly on the reaction rate constant between the HO* and the organic compound. Furthermore, it is shown that the presence of organics affects the current-potential (I-V) curves. In fact, the higher the reaction rate between organics and HO*, the higher is the shift of the I-V curves toward lower potential with respect to oxygen evolution. Supposing that water discharge to free hydroxyl radicals on BDD is governed by Nernst equation, this shift of the I-V curves toward lower potentials has been calculated and compared with the experimental data obtained on BDD using two model compounds: methanol and formic acid.

In this work, cobalt-iron complex sulfides with the same metal molar ratio firmly grown on the surface of nickel foam modified by reduced graphene oxide (Co0.50Fe0.50S-rGO@NF) was prepared and acted as a superior electrocatalyst for electrolyzing water. The same mole ratio of bimetallic-cation doping can induce strong electron-interaction between the complex sulfides and the surface of nickel foam carrier modified by reduced graphene oxide, which reduces the electronic adsorption energy required for HER and OER, as well as improves the electrocatalytic active area exposure. As a result, the optimal electrocatalyst of Co0.50Fe0.50S-rGO@NF behaves excellent electrocatalytic performance with the overpotential of 189 mV @ eta(-2)(20 mA center dot cm) in 1.0 M KOH solution for OER and the overpotential of 155 mV @ eta(-2)(10 mA center dot cm) in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution for HER, respectively. A self-built conventional two-electrode electrolytic cell by using Co0.50Fe0.50S-rGO@NF as the anode and cathode presents lower voltages of 1.39 and 1.66 V to deliver the current density of 10 mA center dot cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and 1.0 M PBS electrolytes, respectively. This study underlines the synergism of the bimetallic-cation doping complex sulfides loaded on nickel foam modified by rGO for boosting the electrocatalytic activity of overall water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000740513800001

Part of B species segregate onto particle surfaces to form ultrathin h-BN shells which stabilize highly dispersed Co NPs under harsh conditions and the remaining B atoms interact strongly with Co atoms inside the NPs. The formed CoBx@h-BN core-shell nanocatalysts exhibit an overpotential of 290 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) making them among the most active catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and they present 150 h OER stability. The improved OER performance has been attributed to the synergetic role of the confinement effect of h-BN shells and activation effect of subsurface B atoms. This work suggests a simple synthetic route to prepare highly active and stable metal nanocatalysts without using any surfactants and supports.									20	2	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100006

In particular, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) possess obvious advantages such as the strong binding to many metals, high stability and synthetic accessibility as compared to other ligands. In this work, the bimetal-NHC complex is pyrolyzed for the first time to synthesize the carbon supported PtPd alloy electrocatalyst (PtPd/CKN) for oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The coordination of metal with NHC ligands strengthened the metal-support interactions, resulting in the stabilization of metal nanoparticles against agglomerations under high-temperature synthesis and catalytic reaction conditions. As a result, the optimal Pt2Pd3/CKN material possesses the uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles with the size of 2-4 nm and exhibits better electrocatalytic activity than commercial Pt/C. More importantly, the strong metal-support interaction effectively enhanced the durability of the alloy electrocatalyst with only 3 mV of negative shift after 10,000 cycles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the light-to-heat conversion usually occurs in a specific wavelength range, which leads to incomplete solar light utiliza-tion with energy loss. Herein, a simple yet effective approach was employed to construct the multi-functional reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film with broad light absorption, which could maximize the use of solar light for generating localized heat that speeds up the transfer of electron and mass in the electrocatalytic OER process. The results indicate that the introduction of solar light lead to the signifi-cant improvement of OER activity, in which the overpotential at 10 mA cm-2 and Tafel slope rate is decreased by 93 mV and 62.4 mV/dec, respectively, compared with that without light illumination.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

MXenes are characterized by their etchable metal layers, excellent structural stability, versatility for heteroatoms doping, excellent electronic conductivity, unique surface functional groups and admirable surface area, suitable for the role of electrocatalyst/support in electrochemical reactions, such as HER. In this review article, we summarized recent developments in MXene-based electrocatalysts synthesis and HER performance in terms of the theoretical and experimental point of view. We systematically evaluated the superiority of the MXene-based catalysts over traditional Pt/C catalysts in terms of HER kinetics, Tafel slope, overpotential and stability, both in acidic and alkaline electrolytic environments. We also pointed out the motives behind the electro catalytic enhancements, the effect of synthesis conditions, heteroatom doping, the effect of surface terminations on the electrocatalytic active sites of various MXenes families. At the end, various possible approaches were recommended for a deeper understanding of the active sites and catalytic improvement of MXenes catalysts for HER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2072-666X		WOS:000858679700001	36144122

In this paper, hollow carbon nanofibers loaded CuCo2O4 nanowires (CuCo2O4@CNFs) were prepared by electrospinning technique and solvothermal method. The CuCo2O4@CNFs exhibit enhances electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requiring an overpotential of 273 mV in a 1.0 M KOH solution to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, the overpotential remained almost constant after 3000 cycles of voltammetry measurements. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity may be attributed to the unique one-dimensional hollow nanostructure of CNFs and high dispersion of CuCo2O4 nanowires, which enhanced the charge transfer and improved the diffusion of the electrolyte ions at the surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000846030900001

In this work, beginning with electrochemical redox behavior analysis of nickel species, the active function of multicomponent catalysts (here carbon-contained FeNi-based metals/hydroxides) for OER was elucidated. The component FeNi layered double hydroxides experienced in situ electrochemical transformation, which were further verified as actual species for dominating OER. By kinetic modeling, the surface reactive intermediate *OH featured a volcano plot with an increase in potential, while *O emerged to a saturated coverage to ensure unhindered progress of the rate-determining step (*O -> *OOH), thus endowing the overall OER with a fast rate. This case study facilitates understanding of the fundamental activities of a multicomponent electrode on the electrocatalytic reaction, which contributes to developing novel materials for future application in electrochemical energy conversion and storage.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000683810700007

Herein, a strategy based on phase separation and laser induction is proposed to prepare 3D binder-free integrated electrodes (IEs). The phase separation between a polybenzimidazole (PBI) solution and a coagulation bath containing metal precursors occurs to form a 3D interconnected porous catalyst precursor layer. After drying, IEs are obtained by laser induction, which simultaneously converts PBI into hierarchically porous laser-induced graphene (HPLIG) and reduces metal precursor to tiny nanoparticles. To demonstrate the versatility of this method, IEs with different HPLIG hybrid catalyst layers and substrates are fabricated. IE-NiFe/HPLIG and IE-Co/HPLIG using carbon paper as a substrate exhibit superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance respectively. Flexible IE-NiCoFe/HPLIG with OER and ORR bifunctionality using carbon cloth as the substrate is applied as an air cathode in rechargeable aqueous Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) and provides a satisfactory power density of 163 mW cm(-2) and cycling stability of 1800 h at 10 mA cm(-2). The electrode also endows solid ZABs with good flexibility. This work offers an industrially viable solution to the challenge of rapid fabrication of IEs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000792581800001

The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) draws specific attention not only because of its lower theoretical voltage of 0.37 V compared with OER (1.23 V), but also for treating sewage water. Herein, Ni/NiO nanosheets with an ultrathin N-doped C layer containing a Schottky Ni and NiO heterointerface is constructed. Because of the self-driven charge redistribution at the heterointerface, janus charge domains are successfully created to drive the cleavage of urea molecules. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between N-doped C and Ni/NiO restrains the deactivation of active sites in alkaline solution. The catalyst displays 1.35 V for UOR at 10 mA/cm(2), 0.27 V lower than that of OER. The final potential increase is only 2 mV after long-term stability test of 12 h for UOR, much smaller than the uncoated sample (38 mV). The present work shows that C-coated transition metal nanomaterials with oxygen vacancies and a Schottky heterointerface are promising candidates for simultaneously boosting UOR with both high activity and long-term stability.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000555297400001	32662934

The structure of compound 1 was determined by single crystal X-ray analysis, which revealed the Mn(II) ions have distorted octahedral geometry as (MnN4OCl). This geometry is created by coordinating of oxygen and two nitrogen donor atoms from semicarbohydrazone ligand, two nitrogen atoms from azide bridges, and chloride anion. Compound 1 was used as a catalyst for electrochemical water oxidation, and the surface of the electrode after the reaction was investigated by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and powder X-ray diffraction analyses. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) experiments revealed that the electrode containing 1 shows high activity for chemical water oxidation with an electrochemical overpotential as low as 377 mV. Although our findings showed that the carbon paste electrode in the presence of 1 is an efficient electrode for water oxidation, it could not withstand water oxidation catalysis under bulk electrolysis and finally converted to Mn oxide nanoparticles which were active for water oxidation along with compound 1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000829131300001	35870060

Here, a stable and ultrathin nickel oxide defect layer with Ni-N is formed in situ and confined at the interface between Ni3N and covered carbon. Holey sheets of ultrathin carbon-coated nickel nitride (Ni3N) were successfully prepared via a facile polymerization and in situ nitridation strategy and exhibit outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance as well as high long-term durability in alkaline electrolyte. The optimized composite possesses a porous and hollow nanostructure, metallic properties, and a superior activity with a low overpotential (similar to 260 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), small Tafel slope (similar to 51 mV dec(-1)), and low loss of activity after a 10 h test in alkaline electrolyte. The significant OER activity and stability are mainly ascribed to (I) ultrathin oxide layers as active sites confined between the Ni3N core and outside carbon coating, (II) overoxidation of Ni3N suppressed by carbon coating synthesized in situ to improve the stability for OER, and (III) strong coupling of Ni3N particles with an ultrathin carbon coating derived from in situ nitridation to efficiently promote fast electron transfer. This catalyst design strategy will greatly aid in the development of highly active OER electrocatalysts in the near future.									21	2	0	0	2	0	21			2574-0962			WOS:000458706800016

It is generally accepted that the purple bacterial reaction center (quinone-reducing photosystem) and the plant and cyanobacterial PSII (oxygen-evolving photosystem) are homologous. It is also apparent that the green sulfur bacterial reaction center is homologous to cyanobacterial PSI (the pyridine nucleotide reducing photosystem). However, it is less obvious that PSI is related to the purple bacterial reaction center. It is herein proposed that PSI represents a gene fusion of the precursors of small light harvesting bacteriochlorophyll proteins from purple bacteria and purple bacterial reaction centers. Furthermore, it is proposed that reaction centers evolved from the membrane-spanning cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc(1) complex and that most membrane-spanning cytochromes may have a common origin.									24	0	0	0	20	0	25			0303-2647			WOS:A1994PY39500002	7888608

The Co-Ni LDHs with a core-shell structure were fabricated using a facile route from a Co-Ni hydroxide precursor with iodine as a topotactic oxidizer. The unique core-shell morphology is likely due to the enrichment of Co(III) hydroxide in the inner core indicated by selected area electron diffraction and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Through a self-assembling process at the organic/inorganic interface and dip-coating, the Co-Ni LDHs were deposited onto FTO glass substrates to prepare composite electrodes. Low over-potential and high current density was achieved in the oxygen evolution reaction. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of Co-Ni LDHs may be attributed to more accessible Co active sites and rapid movement of interlayer ions within their layered structure.									126	6	0	0	8	0	128			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000317980600043	23579333

Conventional electrocatalysts, on the other hand, frequently exhibit significant overpotential and slow transfer kinetics in both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Cation doping engineering is believed to be a suitable way to deal with this problem. To accomplish effective water electrolysis, we use a simple vanadium ion doping strategy to prepare 0.5V-NiCoP. In acidic and alkaline environments, the as-synthesized samples show an overpotential of 78.7 and 56.1 mV for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. In 1 M KOH, it shows an overpotential of 254 mV for the OER at 50 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, under a two-electrode alkaline state, the as-obtained products only require 1.67 V (50 mA cm(-2)) to drive water splitting.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16				2574-0970		WOS:000711030600083

The process involved anodic deposition of manganese oxide nuclei on an electrode substrate and on the surface of GR sheets through electrolysis of aqueous Mn2+ ions in the presence of cationic GR colloids modified with poly(diallydimethylammonium) (PDDA(+)), followed by extraction of the PDDA. The catalytic activity of Mn oxide for the oxygen evolution reaction in an alkaline electrolyte was dramatically enhanced by hybridizing it with GR; an onset overpotential of 335 mV and a Tafel slope of 58 mV per decade were observed with excellent stability. These results can be attributed to a synergistic effect of the catalytic activity of nanosized Mn oxide deposits and the ability of GR to transfer electrons from the catalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2046-2069			WOS:000372253200031

TaC and Si3N4 were characterised by thermogravimmetric and differential thermal analysis for their thermal stability. The Adams fusion method was implemented to deposit IrO2 on the support surfaces. A series of electrocatalysts was prepared with a composition of (IrO2)(x)(TaC/Si3N4)(1-x), where x represents the mass fraction of IrO2 and was equal to 0.1 (only for TaC), 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1. The thin-film method was used for electrochemical analysis of the prepared electrocatalysts. SEM-EDX, BET and powder conductivity measurements were used as complementary techniques to complete characterisation of the electrocatalysts. Additionally, they were compared in their properties with previously reported data for a SiC-Si support. The stability of the electrocatalysts was assessed by estimation of reversibility of the anodic/cathodic processes.

The wastewater treatment containing copper ions has been carried out by various techniques. Among them, the electrodeposition is the "clean" method that is able to achieve the recovery of copper without requiring addition of chemicals and generating sludge or secondary wastes. However, the current efficiency would tend to decrease especially in a dilute solution, because hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction would occur as competition reaction. In this article, we study on the recovery of copper from dilute cupric sulfate solution as a model wastewater by an electrodeposition method using boron-doped diamond electrodes which have relatively higher hydrogen overpotential. Two types of boron-doped diamond electrodes were prepared with different boron doping level. The boron-doped diamond electrodes could achieve the recovery of copper with higher current efficiency because of inhibiting hydrogen evolution reaction, compared with glassy carbon electrode.

Herein, a highly efficient and stable self-supported electrocatalyst with V-Co4N nanowires as the core and NiFe LDH nanosheet arrays as the shell is developed. The obtained NiFe LDH/V-Co4N@NF shows strong electronic interaction at the heterointerface, which remarkably boosts its OER performance. It exhibits ultralow overpotentials of 203 and 240 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, respectively, together with a much smaller Tafel slope of 26.0 mV dec(-1) and robust long-term durability. Structural characterization reveals that doping V contributes to the interfacial electron coupling between Co species and Fe species. Theoretical calculations confirm that the heterointerfaces reduce the free energy barriers of the rate-determining step. This study demonstrates the possibility of improving the OER performance of transition metal nitride catalysts through heterointerface engineering.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000859913400001

Their electron transfer kinetics in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at pH14 are studied. Structuring of NiCo2O4 via KIT-6 improves the intrinsic catalyst performance, e.g., a lower overpotential of approximate to 350mV and a good long-term stability could be observed compared to 385mV and poor stability of commercially available NiCo2O4. Kinetic studies provided insights into structure-activity relations and the nature of the electrode/electrolyte interface. Interestingly, structuring via KIT-6 increases not only the electrochemical surface area but also the current density accompanied by superior charge transfer capacity.									43	0	0	0	1	0	43			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000457144200029

With the purpose of elucidating the complexity of surface dynamics upon OER, we systematically studied two Ni-based crystalline oxides (LaNiO3-delta and La2Li0.5Ni0.5O4) and compared them with the state-of-the-art Ni-Fe (oxy)hydroxide amorphous catalyst. Electrochemical measurements such as rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) and electrochemical quartz microbalance microscopy (EQCM) coupled with a series of physical characterizations including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were conducted to unravel the exact pH effect on both the OER activity and the catalyst stability. We demonstrate that for Ni-based crystalline catalysts the rate for surface degradation depends on the pH and is greater than the rate for surface reconstruction. This behavior is unlike that for the amorphous Ni oxyhydroxide catalyst, which is found to be more stable and pH-independent.									44	2	0	0	4	0	44			2380-8195			WOS:000453805100005

Notably, Fe nanoparticles trapped in a carbon matrix (Fe@PC) have been reported to efficiently promote oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER/ORR). However, research on the effect of doping in Fe particles has been scarce because of the difficulty in synthesizing alloys of small size at elevated temperature. Herein, we focus on the development of bimetallic MOFs composed of Fe and a second metal M (M = Cr, Ni, Co, and Mn) made from a preassembled cluster and their sacrificial use to synthesize FeM@PC composites. After optimising the pyrolysis conditions and determining the optimal structure of an MOF template, the materials were used in the electrocatalytic OER and ORR in 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. Results showed that Co-Fe alloy composites exhibited the best activity for the OER with a 210 mV cathodic shift to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) compared to that of pure Fe@PC. On the other hand, the oxygen reduction reaction most efficiently proceeded on the Mn-Fe alloy composite, showing an 80 mV anodic shift in comparison with all other doped materials.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000487514400006	31490505	
J	Yan, Liang; Zhang, Bing; Wu, Shangyou; Yu, Jianlin					Yan, Liang/0000-0001-9135-360X			A general approach to the synthesis of transition metal phosphide nanoarrays on MXene nanosheets for pH-universal hydrogen evolution and alkaline overall water splitting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	28			14234	14242		10.1039/d0ta05189f				JUL 28 2020	2020	Exploring highly efficient, stable, and non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting is greatly desired but still remains an ongoing challenge. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have been utilized as promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but practical implementation is impeded by the low electronic conductivity and poor chemical stability of TMPs. Recently, a new class of 2D materials, MXenes, have attracted significant attention for diverse energy-related applications. Here, a general approach is reported to synthesize TMPs, including CoP, Ni2P, FeP, and Cu3P nanoarrays, on Ti(3)C(2)MXene nanosheets through topotactic transformations from transition metal layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors. The Ti(3)C(2)MXene in the CoP/Ti(3)C(2)MXene heterostructure acts as a highly conductive substrate which not only facilitates rapid electron transfer at the heterointerface, but also prevents the TMP nanoarrays from aggregation. Meanwhile, TMP nanoarrays prevent MXene nanosheets from restacking and contribute remarkable activity and long-term stability. Particularly, the strong interactions between CoP and the Ti(3)C(2)MXene endow the CoP/Ti(3)C(2)MXene heterostructure with exceptional catalytic activities and stability toward the HER at all pH values. Moreover, the CoP/Ti(3)C(2)MXene also exhibited superior OER performance in alkaline electrolyte. Consequently, the CoP/Ti(3)C(2)MXene even outperforms the commercial Pt/C||IrO(2)couple for overall water splitting under alkaline conditions. The experimental results reveal that the strong electronic coupling effect at the heterointerface can efficiently accelerate the HER/OER kinetics. This study opens up opportunities to rational design of advanced electrocatalysts for diverse applications by using the MXene family as the underlying support coupled with various active components.									55	6	0	0	2	0	56			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000551538000036

In this work, nanosized Pt/IrO2 electrocatalysts are synthesized and investigated for the oxygen evolution and reduction reactions in unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs). The catalysts are prepared by decorating Pt nanoparticles (2-10 nm) onto the surface of a nanophase IrO2 (7 nm) support using an ultrasonic polyol method. The synthesis procedure allows deposition of metallic Pt nanoparticles on Ir-oxide without causing any occurrence of metallic Ir. The latter is significantly less active for oxygen evolution than the corresponding oxide. This process represents an important progress with respect to the state of the art in this field being the oxygen electrocatalyst generally obtained by mechanical mixing of Pt and IrO2. The nanosized Pt/IrO2 (50:50 wt.%) is sprayed onto a Nafion 115 membrane and used as dual function oxygen electrode, whereas 30 wt.% Pt/C is used as dual function hydrogen electrode in the URFC. Electrochemical activity of the membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) is investigated in a single cell at room temperature and atmospheric pressure both under electrolysis and fuel cell mode to assess the perspectives of the URFC to operate as energy storage device in conjunction with renewable power sources.

Owing to the complexing function of KSCN during Fe-leaching for the optimum Ni/Fe ratio and the stabilization of Fe-doped (oxy)hydroxides under the adequately higher current density within alkaline media, the OER electrode composed solely of 4J36 INVAR alloy as substrate needs an overpotential of only 250 mV to attain 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, besides its performance stability at two different current densities. This simple and cost-effective fabrication of OER electrode, which is binder-free, self-supporting and matrix-rejuvenating, will open a new door to the cutting-edge design of electrocatalyst for water splitting.

The highest-performing systems use nanostructured semiconductors coated with water-oxidation catalysts. Despite much work, the design principles governing the integration of catalysts with semiconductors are poorly understood. Using hematite as a model system, we show how semiconductor morphology and electrical conductivity of the catalyst affect the system photoresponse. Electrically conductive catalysts can introduce substantial "shunt" recombination currents if they contact both the semiconductor surface and the underlying conducting-glass substrate, leading to poor performance. This recombination can be largely eliminated by using pinhole-free semiconductors, using selective photoassisted electrodeposition of thin catalyst layers on the semiconductor surface, using electrically insulating catalyst layers, or adding an intermediate insulating oxide layer. The results of this study are used to clarify the mechanisms behind several important results reported in the literature.									32	1	0	0	4	0	32			2380-8195			WOS:000430369600028

On the route to deploying this technology, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to designing remarkable electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems. While the performance indicators of the CO2RR such as current density and faradaic efficiency are well researched, the energy efficiency (EE), a guiding metric for industrial implementation and economic feasibility of the CO2RR, should merit more deliberation. In this context, our review aims at providing a comprehensive understanding of full-cell EE of the CO2RR. First, the fundamental principles towards achieving high EE in the CO2RR are presented. Subsequently, recent state-of-the-art strategies for kinetically boosting EE are elaborated, with focus on electrocatalysts and system design to lower the cell voltage and increase faradaic efficiency. In particular, the emerging integrated electrolysis is highlighted, where the conventional anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is replaced with other value-added oxidation reactions, affording great promise to enhance the EE and economic benefits of the CO2RR. Finally, future research opportunities in this rapidly evolving field are outlined. This review would attract considerable attention to full-cell EE and further inspire investigation into increasing EE at a commercially relevant current density to motivate the scale-up of the CO2RR.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000828218700001

Co8FeS8/Fe7S8@NC contains Co8FeS8/Fe7S8, amorphous and graphitic carbon. Existence of a large number of mesopores in the sample was conducive to the transmission of mass and electrons as well as exposure of active sites. Co8FeS8/Fe7S8@NC-0.8 needs overpotentials of 255 and 315 mV to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. The lower Tafel slope (59.5 mV dec(-1)) and good durability have also been observed in the Co8FeS8/Fe7S8@NC-0.8. The 2Cdl value of 83.7 mF cm(-2) indicate that the introduction of 0.8 g thiourea could greatly improve the exposure of electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, this research provides a new perspective for the development of efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts with industrial application prospect.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596	1095-726X		WOS:000794037600003

Here, abundant Co3O4/MnCO(3)heterointerfaces supported on Ni foam are facilely fabricatedviaan energy-efficient hydrothermal annealing method. The heterostructure and cactus-like hierarchical structure enable the sample to have prominent OER activity and excellent stability. Specifically, the electrocatalyst requires only a low overpotential of 273 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and has a small Tafel slope of 62.06 mV dec(-1)in 1 M KOH electrolyte; these results are superior to most non-noble metal based OER catalysts reported to date. Our work provides a novel perspective for the rational design and synthesis of low-cost electrocatalysts, especially in the selection of other low-budget compounds for interface engineering.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1466-8033			WOS:000542710900006

We report on the significant structural and electronic transformations under anodic oxygen evolution reaction conditions of a novel, large area scalable sputtered ZnO:Co electrocatalyst. ZnO:Co sputtered films showed the transition of the polycrystalline ZnO:Co electrocatalyst material to a partially amorphous nanocomposite (ZnO:Co/Co(OH)(2)/CoOOH). A high reactivity of the electrocatalyst material compensates effectively the low specific surface area of sputtered electrocatalyst thin films. The aim of this work is to examine the polycystral morphology of sputtered electrocatalyst thin film material, which can be also produced industrially on large areas and has a high WOC performance.

In alkaline media, the LSCF-10% catalyst exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER, affording a low onset potential of 1.583 V and a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a potential of 1.643 V. The excellent catalytic activity of OER for LSCF-10% is mainly attributed to the morphological characteristics of one-dimensional nanofibers. Compared with the nanorods and nanoparticles, one-dimensional nanofibers not only increase the specific surface area, but also enhance the efficient transport pathways for electrons and ions. Thus, the rational design of the morphology is beneficial to enhance the OER catalytic activities of the perovskite oxides.									24	3	0	0	2	0	25				2046-2069		WOS:000381512600078

Prepared with facile hydrothermal reactions and phosphorization, the NiCoP@NiMn LDH/NF is simultaneously highly active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (100, 300, and 600 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 293, 315, and 327 mV, respectively) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (100, 200, and 300 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 116, 130, and 136 mV, respectively). Interestingly, with cell voltages of 1.519, 1.642, 1.671, and 1.687 V at 10, 100, 200, and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively, for overall water splitting, this electrocatalyst achieves 95.2% faradaic efficiency for OER, suggesting a relatively high contribution of water splitting in the apparent current in spite of the existence of partial catalyst oxidation. The heterostructure arrays supported on Ni foam have some advantages, acting as a bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalyst: (1) heterostructured NCoP@NiMn LDH combines the intrinsic properties of individual NiCoP (excellent activity for HER) and NiMn LDH (high activity for OER) via the effective interface engineering between the two phases; (2) the NiCoP core material serves as a fast electron transfer channel to enhance the electrode's electrical conductivity; and (3) Ni foam with a three-dimensional-network structure as a support is beneficial to exposing more active sites and ensures efficient gas bubble release and electron/mass transfer.									58	1	0	0	2	0	58			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000510532000020	31851486

The overpotential during the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over the beta-FeOOH: Ni/a-Ni(OH)(2) stacked nanorod anodes was 170mV, and an OER current of 10mA/cm(2) was obtained at an overpotential of 430 mV in a 0.1M KOH solution. X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, Mossbauer spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and impedance spectroscopy suggested that surface modification with the a-Ni(OH)(2) lowered the OER overpotential of beta-FeOOH(Cl): Ni, resulting in the very high current density at low potential compared with Fe-rich oxide and oxyhydroxide electrodes reported previously. Mossbauer spectroscopy suggested interaction between Fe and Ni species, which may be crucial evidence for the enhanced activity in the Fe-rich OER system.									20	1	0	0	0	0	20			0009-2673	1348-0634		WOS:000431202500009

The doping of S is evidenced to induce a structural and size transition on the Co deposited layer, which leads to a significant increase on the electrochemical surface area and more accessible active sites for enhancing the catalytic activity. The formation of oxygen deficiencies-rich Co-O/OH species with a phase transformation from Co-S species is noticed during OER. Benefiting from the merits of in situ growth, the Co-S films obtained at an optimal S doping level (denoted as Co-S-50/NF) can robustly drive high current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) with low overpotentials of 322 and 368 mV for OER, and 124 and 155 mV for HER. The water electrolyzer assembled with Co-S-50/NF requires only 1.79 and 2.08 V to reach 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, and 1.72 V to achieve 500 mA cm(-2) in 30 wt% KOH at 353 K for over 150 h.									28	2	0	0	3	0	28			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000483408400048

In contrast to previous reports, we observed a passive effect of Ti3C2Tx MXene on the OER performance of CoNi-MOFNs although the electronic conductivity of the nanocomposites was improved. The combined analysis of electrochemical results and atomic valence state characterization demonstrates that the decreased OER activity is likely ascribed to the unfavorable electron donation from Ti3C2Tx MXene, which suppresses the formation of active species for OER from the oxidation of Co2+ and Ni2+ to higher valence states in the nanocomposite. Consequently, more attention needs to be paid to the rational design of nanocomposites with MXenes for electrocatalytic applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2199-692X			WOS:000628906500001

In this work, we carried out comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) simulations of Ni-based electrocatalysts for the OER by applying suitable dopants in beta-NiOOH. A range of Fe and Co atoms (%) are employed as doping agents to increase the overall catalytic ability, stability, and feasibility of NiOOH. Our simulations indicate that Ni88%Fe6%Co6%OOH is efficient, stable, and provides more catalytic sites at the surface of resulting catalysts for water adsorption and dissociation, which facilitate the OER. The lower overpotential for the OER is estimated from the higher adsorption energy of water molecule over the surface of Ni88%Fe6%Co6%OOH, followed by other electronic properties such as band structure, electrostatic potential, the density of states, and surface formation energy.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			2470-1343			WOS:000563015100059	32832804

However, these electrocatalysts usually suffer from the lack of active species transformation during OER due to the high stability and reversibility of the spinel structure. Herein, we highlight that electrochemical reduction could serve as a general activation process with dual modulation on spinels and enhance the catalytic activity. Taking Co3O4 as an example, both rock salt generation and increased surface roughness could be realized. Moreover, because of the synergistic effect of dual modulations, surface rock salt could be massively generated, which breaks the scale limitation of chemical reduction. With optimal modulation, electrochemically reduced Co3O4 showed lower overpotential and enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, electrochemical reduction activation could be extended to other spinel oxides. We anticipate that electrochemical reduction activation will be a facile route to realize efficient electrocatalytic performance, offering new insights toward the correlation among processing methods, active sites, and catalytic performance.									39	2	0	0	3	0	39			2380-8195			WOS:000458938400009

Oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) provides electron for hydrogen production. However, OER is a complicated reaction and is a bottleneck for water splitting. Herein, we investigate the oxygen-evolving activity of a pentanuclear iron complex and consider the role of iron compounds other than the complex in OER as a candidate for the true catalyst in the presence of this highly efficient catalyst. The structure of the complex consists of a [Fe-3(mu(3)-O)] core wrapped by two [Fe(mu-L)(3), LH: 2,2'-(1H-pyrazole-3,5-diyl)dipyridine] units. After OER in the presence of the complex, the operated electrode in the absence of the complex and in a fresh buffer solution displays OER. Using scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, in situ visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and some electrochemical experiments, it is found that under oxygen-evolution conditions, this complex is not stable and Fe oxide on the surface of the electrode could be at least one of the candidates as the true catalyst for OER. Based on our study also a turnover frequency of 0.2-0.3 s(-1) was calculated for the formed Fe oxide. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Computational research has driven important developments in understanding and designing heterogeneous OER catalysts using linear scaling relationships derived from computed binding energies. Herein, we interrogate 17 of the most active molecular OER catalysts, based on different transition metals (Ru, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu), and show they obey similar scaling relations to those established for heterogeneous systems. However, we find that the conventional OER descriptor underestimates the activity for very active OER complexes as the standard approach neglects a crucial one-electron oxidation that many molecular catalysts undergo prior to O-O bond formation. Importantly, this additional step allows certain molecular catalysts to circumvent the "overpotential wall", leading to enhanced performance. With this knowledge, we establish fundamental principles for the design of ideal molecular OER catalysts.									83	2	0	0	5	1	82			2041-1723			WOS:000495393700001	31704927

A compositional gradient method has been used to produce non-equilibrium surfaces of PdAu solid solution alloys. XPS shows surface compositions for these un-annealed alloys to be the same as the bulk, in contrast to the observed and expected behaviour of annealed alloys. The surface redox behaviour of the alloys provides direct evidence for the existence of Pd ensembles with distinctive surface chemistry dominating the oxygen interaction at intermediate alloy compositions. CO stripping voltammetry indicates that alloying of Pd with Au results in a strong poisoning of CO adsorption with the exception of CO adsorbed on Pd monomers. The compositional dependence of the HER and HOR activities is strongly correlated on the alloy surfaces, with a maximum in geometric activity observed at 60 at% Au, corresponding to a maximum in specific activity at 70 at% Au, for both reactions. This activity is associated with Pd poor ensembles. There is some evidence that while the Pd monomer catalyses the HER, HOR is not sustained at compositions where the monomer is present.									45	2	0	0	1	0	46			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000281726800026	20730167

Overcoming these challenges, heterostructures have recently attracted attention because they encourage alternative OER electrocatalysts with active structural features. In this study, synthesis, characterization and electrochemical evaluation of the heterostructure of iron oxide/iron sulfide (Fe2O3/FeS) and its counterparts, iron oxide (Fe2O3) and iron sulfide (FeS) are reported. The structural features of as-synthesized electrocatalysts have been evaluated by infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction study and scanning electron microscopy. Fe2O3/FeS was found to be a stable electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting, which initiates OER at a surprisingly low potential of 1.49 V (vs RHE) in 1 M potassium hydroxide. The Fe2O3/FeS electrocatalyst drives OER with a current density of 40 mA cm(-2) at overpotential of 370 mV and a Tafel slope of 90 mV dec(-1). Its performance is better than its counterparts (Fe2O3 and FeS) under similar electrochemical conditions. At an applied potential of 1.65 V (vs RHE), continuous oxygen production for several hours revealed the long-term stability and effective activity of the Fe2O3/FeS electrocatalyst for OER. The asdeveloped Fe2O3/FeS heterostructure provides an effective alternative low-cost metalbased electrocatalysts for OER. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In these NBCs, the molar content of nitrogen and boron can exceed that of carbon, at the same time with good electronic conductivity. It was observed that there is a coexistence tendency for B/N two elements which was able to maintain the aromaticity of micro-regions. The Morphology analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectrum results point to a two-dimensional conjugated dominated structure. In addition, NBCs exhibited superior electrochemical performance for ORR with much better methanol tolerance and catalytic stability than commercial Pt/C catalyst. NBCs also showed excellent catalytic activity for HER in aqueous solutions over a wide range of pH values, including acidic, neutral and alkaline conditions. These ternary nanosheets of such high N and B content has not been previously reported and potentially open up a broad research and application prospects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that the secondary discharge plateau is due to the reduction of oxygen dissolved in the bulk electrolyte and in the solid film. During the galvanostatic discharge of 1 mu m nickel hydroxide films at room temperature in 3 wt percent KOH solutions, the second discharge plateau was observed only in the presence of dissolved oxygen in the electrolyte. When the solution was de-oxygenated, no residual capacity could be extracted from the electrodes even at low discharge rates. It was also found that the duration of the second plateau was limited by the diffusion of oxygen to the electrode surface. The kinetic parameters for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution were found using polarization techniques. The exchange current density and tafel slope for oxygen reduction were found to be 3 x 10(-9) A/cm(2) and 39 mV/decade, respectively, and the exchange current density and tafel slope for oxygen evolution were found to be 3 x 10(-8) A/cm(2) and 69 mV/decade, respectively.

Herein, we successfully synthesize iron hydr(oxy)oxide nano-arrays on carbon cloth (FeOOH@CC), and then metallic nickel is electrodeposited on its surface to fabricate FeOOH/Ni heterojunction nanoarrays. Notably, the optimal FeOOH/Ni heterojunction nanoarrays catalyst shows high electrocatalytic performance toward OER with a small overpotential of 257.8 mV at 50 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 30.8 mV dec(-1) and outstanding long-term stability in alkaline media. The superior OER performance could be ascribed to the introducing of metallic nickel. The nickel in-situ grows on the surface of FeOOH, which not only can improve the conductivity of FeOOH, but also cooperate with FeOOH to form the FeOOH/Ni heterogeneous interfaces for further enhancing OER electrocatalytic activities. This work provides a simple and efficient strategy of interface engineering to fabricate oxyhydroxide/metal heterojunction nanoarrays as high-efficiency OER catalysts.

Aiming at the enhancement of oxygen electrode kinetics and durability, a facile and scalable electrospinning method is employed to fabricate antimony doped tin oxide nanowires (Sb-SnO2 NWs) as support materials for iridium oxide. Both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results show that the as-prepared Sb-SnO2 NW is stacked from primary Sb-SnO2 nanoparticles (Sb-SnO2 NPs) with diameters of 15-25 nm and exhibits a uniform porous nanowire structure with diameters in the range of 200-300 nm. The synthesized Sb-SnO2 NW has a BET surface area of 60 m(2) g(-1) and an electronic conductivity of 0.83 S cm(-1). Benefiting from the porous nanowire structure and high electronic conductivity of the Sb-SnO2 NW support, the supported IrO2 catalyst exhibits significant enhancement of mass activity toward OER in acidic electrolytes compared with that of Sb-SnO2 NP supported IrO2 catalyst and pure IrO2. The improved catalytic performance for OER is further confirmed by proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer tests at 80 degrees C. A test of such an electrolyzer cell at 450 mA cm(-2) shows good durability within a period of up to 646 h.									48	2	0	0	2	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000363145500044

One of the main reasons for this is that the interactive contributions from geometric and electronic effects to enhancements in reaction activity are difficult to distinguish from one another. Here, on well-defined Ru-Pt core-shell (Ru@Pt) and homogeneous alloy (RuPt) model electrocatalysts, we are able to isolate these two effects. Furthermore, we observe the dominant role of strain in the intrinsic activity of the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. In the Ru@Pt icosahedral nanostructure, the highly strained Pt shells effectively accommodate the interfacial lattice mismatch from a facecentered cubic structured Ru core. This unique property leads to a weak binding of hydrogen and optimal interaction with hydroxyl species during the reaction, thus leading to an enhanced apparent activity of Ru@Pt.									126	9	0	0	8	0	128			2380-8195			WOS:000432478200023

As such, the introduction of noble metals with suitable components and nanostructures is a promising approach. This is the first example of an electrocatalyst based on the ternary nanocomposite of Ag3PO4, Bi2WO6, and TiO2 catalyzing OER in a 1 M KOH solution. The Ag3PO4-Bi2WO6-TiO2 nanostructures were synergistic due to the enhanced electronic effect of Ag3PO4, which improved the OER performance at an overpotential of 360 mV. The Ag3PO4-Bi2WO6-TiO2 nanohybrid was stable and exhibited a remarkable efficiency of 99.8 % for the OER. In comparison with the catalytic activity of Bi2WO6-TiO2 and TiO2, Ag3PO4-Bi2WO6-TiO2 proved to be a highly efficient OER catalyst. The anchoring of Ag3PO4 on a binary catalyst array represents a new strategy for the design of high-capacity OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691192500006

In this work, Ni-MOF/Ox-MOF is constructed through the "growth of MOF on MOF" strategy. Following with in-situ conformal transformation in alkaline solutions, Ni-MOF/LDH heterostructures are fabricated, which exhibit excellent water oxidation activity owing to the high surface area of Ni-MOF substrate and the well-tailored phase interfaces. In addition, the high stability of Ni-MOF/LDH is demonstrated in a Zn-air battery. In-situ Raman technique identifies that the Ni centers are the true active sites during water oxidation. DFT calculations demonstrate that the charge transfer and the conductivity at the Ni-MOF/LDH interfaces is highly enhanced. This work provides an efficient method of fabricating MOF/LDH heterostructures with optimized phase interfaces and offers new insights into OER.									49	1	0	0	2	0	48			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000621615000001

The microwave-assisted hydrothermal method was applied to synthesize transition metal oxide catalysts by controlling the amount of cobalt and iron. This work solves the cracking problem for the catalytic layer during the water electrolysis. It uses Fe2O3 as the support and covers a catalytic layer outside it and a nanoscale gap between each catalyst, which can help to remove the gas and fill up the water. The unique structure of the catalysts can prevent them from accumulating gas and increasing their efficiency for long-term water electrolysis. By using unique catalysts in the water electrolyzer, the current density reaches higher than 200 mA cm(-2) at 2.0 V and does not show a significant decay even after 200 h.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000747659200001

Herein, we prepared the NiFe layered-double-hydroxide (LDH) decorated with Fe-doped NiSe nanosheet on nickel foam ((Ni, Fe)Se@NiFe-LDH/NF) by a three-step method. The hierarchical (Ni, Fe)Se@NiFe-LDH/NF exhibit outstanding OER properties in an alkaline medium. The overpotential at 100 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of (Ni, Fe)Se@NiFe-LDH/NF is 253 mV and 47 mV/dec, respectively. The hierarchical (Ni, Fe)Se@NiFe-LDH/NF shows good long-term stability. The outstanding OER performance is attributed to the Fe doping, fast charge transfer and the synergistic interaction between (Ni, Fe)Se and NiFe-LDH.

These data confirm the method-independent universal scaling relationship for water oxidation catalysts, describe routes toward circumventing this relationship, and justify the ascendency of Ru catalysts for this reaction. Leveraging this information while applying catalyst design principles, we summarize experimental results, giving credence to our prediction of 9 earth-abundant molecular catalysts with theoretical overpotentials ranging from 200 to 400 mV as promising leads for experimental investigation. We also establish insights into spin-dependent scaling relations for key OER intermediates.

This study aims to investigate the effects of steam concentration on the behavior of Chinese Shengli brown coal gasification in the presence and absence of low concentration of oxygen in a newly-designed drop-tube quartz reactor. Experimental results indicate that the variation in steam concentration had a significant impact on coal conversion, largely depending on reaction temperatures and availability of oxygen. The coal conversion could somehow decrease with increasing steam concentration in the presence of low concentration of oxygen. Meanwhile, the presence of oxygen in the gas has enhanced the Na retention in char probably due to the formation of O-containing compounds or complexes on the char surface. The char structure measured by Raman spectroscopy suggests that the selective consumption of small aromatic ring systems by steam-char reactions was getting less significant when the steam concentration increased to more than 15% by volume. Furthermore, the isothermal reactivities of chars determined by TGA in air imply that the reaction pathways of char-steam and char-oxygen were likely different as the reactivity curves showed totally different shapes.

And integrating CO2ER with an anodic organic transformation to replace the oxygen evolution reaction is highly desirable. Here, In2O3 is selected as the model material to reveal the surface reconstruction under CO2ER condition. In situ and ex situ results reveal that the electrochemical in situ reconstruction of crystalline In2O3 leads to the formation of crystalline-In/amorphous-In/In2O3-x heterostructure (In/In2O3-x). In/In2O3-x acts as the real active phase with Faradaic efficiency of similar to 89.2% for the formate, outperforming In (similar to 67.5%). The improved performance can be ascribed to electron-rich In rectified by Schottky effect of In/In2O3-x heterostructure. Impressively, formate and high-value octanenitrile can be simultaneously achieved by integrating CO2ER with octylamine oxidation in anIn/In2O3-x kNi(2)P two-electrode electrolyzer.

The as-obtained MnO2@NF nanowire-type electrode has demonstrated a specific capacitance (SC) of 641 F g(-1) and a capacitance retention of 97%. The as-assembled MnO2//MnO2 symmetric supercapacitor device has endowed a maximum energy density of 25 W h kg(-1) at power and current densities of 588 W kg(-1) and 2 A g(-1), respectively, which has successfully activated three different-colored LEDs with moderate light intensity. Furthermore, a small overpotential of 260 mV is obtained when the MnO2 electrode was used for OERs, highlighting its potential as an efficient catalyst. The use of MnO2 nanowires in supercapacitors and OERs has several advantages, such as (a) accessibility of several active sites, (b) easy charge transfer with reduced diffusion resistance, and (c) smooth and fast percolation of electrolyte ions responsible for optimum redox reactions. Therefore, the design of a hybrid system, containing both energy storage and water splitting applications, can be featured using only the MnO2 electrode material.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000582432400026

In this paper, polyicosahedral (plh) Ag32X6 (X = 3d transition metals) core-shell structures are calculated systematically by the density functional theory (DFT) method to predict their electrocatalytic activities for ORR and OER. It is found that the strain on the outer shell of the core-shell structures can be an intrinsic descriptor that describes the bifunctional catalytic activities of the catalysts. A higher compressive strain leads to more positive charge on the surface of the shell and consequently higher catalytic activities. The results provide a theoretical base for the rational design and screening of the Ag-based core-shell catalysts for clean energy conversion and storage.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2046-2069		WOS:000455485600061	35521622

The model comprises four (meta)stable intermediates (S-0, S-1, S-2 and S-3) and one transient S-4 state, which precedes dioxygen formation occurring in a concerted reaction from two water-derived oxygens bound at an oxo-bridged tetra manganese calcium (Mn4CaO5) cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex(3-7). This reaction is coupled to the two-step reduction and protonation of the mobile plastoquinone Q(B) at the acceptor side of PSII. Here, using serial femto second X-ray crystallography and simultaneous X-ray emission spectroscopy with multi-flash visible laser excitation at room temperature, we visualize all (meta) stable states of Kok's cycle as high-resolution structures (2.04-2.08 angstrom). In addition, we report structures of two transient states at 150 and 400 mu s, revealing notable structural changes including the binding of one additional 'water', Ox, during the S-2 -> S-3 state transition. Our results suggest that one water ligand to calcium (W3) is directly involved in substrate delivery. The binding of the additional oxygen Ox in the S-3 state between Ca and Mnl supports O-O bond formation mechanisms involving O5 as one substrate, where Ox is either the other substrate oxygen or is perfectly positioned to refill the O5 position during O-2 release. Thus, our results exclude peroxo-bond formation in the S-3 state, and the nucleophilic attack of W3 onto W2 is unlikely.									252	7	0	0	95	0	252			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000450048400064	30405241

In this study, supported noble metal catalysts Pt/C, Pd/C, and Au/C were paired with popular Li-O-2 electrolyte solvents dimethoxyethane (DME), tetraglyme (TEGDME), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The effects of these combinations on stability, kinetics, and activity were assessed. We show evidence of a synergistic effect between Pt and Pd catalysts and a DMSO-based electrolyte which enhances the kinetics of oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. DME and TEGDME are more prone to decomposition and less kinetically favorable for oxygen reduction and evolution than DMSO. While the order of oxygen reduction onset potentials with each catalyst was found to be consistent across electrolyte (Pd > Pt > Au), larger overpotentials with DME and TEGDME, and negative shifts in onset after only five cycles favor the stability of a DMSO electrolyte. Full cell cycling experiments confirm that catalyst-DMSO combinations produce up to 9 times higher discharge capacities than the same with TEGDME after 20 cycles (similar to 707.4 vs. 78.8 mA h g(-1) with Pd/C). Ex situ EDS and in situ EIS analyses of resistive species in the cathode suggest that improvements in capacity with DMSO are due to a combination of greater electrolyte conductivity and catalyst synergies. Our findings demonstrate that co-selection of catalyst and electrolyte is necessary to exploit chemical synergies and improve the performance of Li-O-2 cells.									62	2	0	0	3	1	64			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000330054300052	24406938

Because this procedure is regarded as a hindrance of electron transfer, finding robust and low-cost OER catalysts to fulfill the requirements of increasing the rate of the reaction is favored. In this work, we first developed the anodic cyclic voltammetry (CV) electrodeposition method and obtained amorphous iron nickel oxide thin films (FeNiOx); we then performed a systematic study of the electrochemical conditions and the optimization results. The crystallinity and morphology of the thin film with superior electrochemical performance were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, investigation of the electrochemical OER performance suggested that FeNiOx has the highest activity among these samples. A small onset overpotential of 300 mV was achieved, and the Tafel slope was as low as 38 mV dec(-1).

Herein, we describe a general technique to fabricate thin oxide layer coated NiCo alloy nanochain arrays (NCAs) on Ni foam by a hydrothermal reaction and subsequent low-temperature reduction. The hybrid NiCo-300 electrocatalyst shows excellent bifunctional HER and OER activities in overall water electrolysis in an alkaline medium. It shows lower overportential and better electrocatalytic kinetics than pristine NiCo2O4 nanorod arrays (NRAs) and bare NiCo alloy, reaching 10 mAcm(-2) and 100mA cm(-2) at low overpotentials of 156 mV and 245 mV in HER and 320 mV and 390 mV in OER, respectively. The thin oxide layer on the NiCo-300 surface produces synergistic effects to enhance the HER and OER activities. In a two-electrode system, the symmetrical electrolyzer needs a cell voltage of 1.688 V for a 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current and exhibits good long-term stability. The results reveal a facile way to fabricate nanostructured transition metal alloys with thin oxide coatings as highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts promising for overall water electrolysis.

Focus has been essentially placed not only on reactions of high interest, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and CO2 reduction reaction (CDRR) but also on other more "confidential " reactions (e.g., reduction of oxyanionic species and ascorbic acid oxidation). It is now well-known that POMs represent one class of fascinating compounds largely explored in inorganic chemistry, highlighted by the large number of complexes with structural, redox, and functional diversities which make them particularly attractive as efficient electrocatalysts for a wide range of significant multiredox reactions. The transposition of homogeneous electrocatalysis to (photo)electrode-supported electrocatalysis using POMs and its derivatives undoubtedly constitutes a really promising avenue toward the development of modern electrochemical devices, which could be of high interest for applications in chemical sensing, biosensing, electroanalysis, and solar driven fuel cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000860354200001

It still remains a great challenge to develop low-cost, highly efficient, and durable OER catalysts. Here, the composition and morphology of Ni-Co bimetal phosphide nanocages are engineered for a highly efficient and durable OER electrocatalyst. The nanocage structure enlarges the effective specific area and facilitates the contact between catalyst and electrolyte. The as-prepared Ni-Co bimetal phosphide nanocages show superior OER performance compared with Ni2P and CoP nanocages. By controlling the molar ratio of Ni/Co atoms in Ni-Co bimetal hydroxides, the Ni0.6Co1.4P nanocages derived from Ni0.6Co1.4(OH)(2) nanocages exhibit remarkable OER catalytic activity (eta = 300 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and long-term stability (10 h for continuous test). The density-functional-theory calculations suggest that the appropriate Co doping concentration increases density of states at the Fermi level and makes the d-states more close to Fermi level, giving rise to high charge carrier density and low intermedia adsorption energy than those of Ni2P and CoP. This work also provides a general approach to optimize the catalysis performance of bimetal compounds.									284	16	0	0	16	0	286			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000430658300003

Much effort has thus been spent on exploring highly stable polymer electrodes especially for water oxidation, resulting in very little scope of polymers as potential candidates. Here, we use polythiophene with sulfur-based heterocycles to demonstrate the role of redox groups of unstable polymers in boosting both of its activity and stability as a polymer electrode for water oxidation. We found that the autoxidation of sulfur atoms in polythiophene tethered to the surface of carbon cloth greatly enhances the oxygen evolution reaction activity of the polymer carbon backbone by modifying its electronic structure, which isn't involved in the oxidation process and possible over oxidation, clarifying the pivotal role played by the chaperone redox groups.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000575366700006

The chemical and physical properties, therefore, can be widely tuned by adjusting the degree of oxidation through photoreaction, because the semiconducting domains act as a semiconducting photocatalyst when irradiated with light of energy exceeding the band gap of the domains. In this paper, we report new photoreactions similar to photocatalytic reactions in which H-2 and CO2 are evolved from an aqueous suspension of GO nanosheets under UV irradiation; these reactions are based on the photoreactions of oxygen-containing functional groups and carbon. As a result, reduced GO (rGO) nanosheets with many holes and defects were produced. We conjecture that some carbons in the holes belong to zigzag edges, CH bonds, or both and that the rGO nanosheets therefore have ferromagnetic properties. In photoelectrochemical measurements of a GO nanosheet electrode, a large anodic photocurrent was generated by the CO2 evolution reaction and a small cathodic photocurrent was generated by reduction of oxygen-containing functional groups and the H-2 evolution reaction. The mechanism of the photoreaction between GO nanosheets and water is discussed in terms of band energy levels estimated from experimental results.									211	9	0	0	42	1	218			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000295245500047

This unique structure enables high catalyst loadings and optimal electrode contact, leading to a surprisingly high catalytic activity towards OER, which almost approaches that of the state-of-the-art precious OER electrocatalysts (IrO2). Moreover, the catalytic process features favourable electrode kinetics and strong durability during long-term cycling. The dual-active-site mechanism was proposed for this 3D catalyst, i.e., Ni/NiOOH and Ni-N(O)-C are both active sites. The enhanced performance is attributed to synergistic effects of N-doped graphene and Ni, which enhance the activities of both components for OER.									286	12	0	0	14	0	288			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000327250300030		
J	Vitt, JE; Engstrom, RC								Imaging of oxygen evolution and oxide formation using quinine fluorescence								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				69	6			1070	1076		10.1021/ac960816b				MAR 15 1997	1997	Quinine was used as a fluorescent acid-base indicator to image electrode reactions that consume hydroxide ions, The fluorescence intensity was used as a measure of the microscopically local current at the electrode surface during O-2 evolution and oxide formation. Highest resolution images were obtained 300-600 ms after application of the potential in an unbuffered (pH 10) 0.5 mM quinine solution. The increase in fluorescence intensity observed at later times was offset by a decrease in spatial resolution. Imaging anodic reactions using quinine fluorescence is complementary to the previously established method for imaging cathodic processes using fluorescein fluorescence. Similarly, this new method should be able to provide information about microscopically local reaction rates and concentration profiles at electrode surfaces for a variety of anodic reactions.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			0003-2700			WOS:A1997WM55000014

The uniform and ultra-small Pt nanodots ( similar to 2 nm) achieved full coverage on NWs leads to significant structural modulation, along with increased hierarchical and disorder degree. It also generates high Pt-Cu interaction, as evidenced by the crystal lattice deformation of metallic phases and the charge transfer from Cu to Pt, leading to enhancement towards both of hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) processes. The hybrid exhibits low overpotential values of 72 mV and 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively, and these are superior to those of other surveyed materials. The mass activity of hybrid is around 3.1 times higher than commercial Pt-C (10 wt%) for HER and 6.4 times higher than Pt-C and RuO2-C for OER under similar testing conditions. This research may serve as a promising method for developing electrocatalysts with high activity but minimal Pt usage towards water splitting.									78	1	0	0	4	0	80			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000463032200025

Herein, we design three-dimensional (3D) tubular hierarchical core-shell electrocatalysts for the OER using a simple and highly controllable two-step method. The large-scale tubular Cu(OH)(2) arrays are directly grown on Cu foam (CF) at room temperature, followed by the growth of highly porous CoNi carbonate hydroxides (CH) via a low-temperature hydrothermal method on the walls of these Cu(OH)(2) nanotubes (NTs). The hollow and open-structured core-shell hierarchical Cu(OH)(2)@CoNiCH NTs/CF electrode with a large surface area and numerous mesoporous and short diffusion paths can provide many active sites, fast electron transport and easy accessibility of water, leading to an excellent OER activity in an alkaline electrolyte with an overpotential of 288 mV and 326 mV at a current density of 30 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, also with robust durability.

Despite various descriptors are reported, it still has limitations in the facile prediction, given that complicated analytical techniques as well as time-consuming modeling and calculations are indispensable. In the present work, strong correlation of magnetic property with OER performance is revealed by in-depth investigations on the crystal and electronic structures. A facile descriptor of Curie/Neel temperature (T-C/N) is developed for La2-xSrxCo2O6-delta perovskite oxides, based on the inference that both magnetism and OER are rooted in the electron exchange interaction. Specifically, both the T-C/N and OER activity are proportional to the degree of p-d orbital hybridization, which increases with enlarged bond angle of CoOCo and/or increased oxidation of Co. This finding reveals that T-C/N from magnetic characterizations is an effective descriptor in designing novel OER electrocatalysts, and interdisciplinary researches are advantageous for revealing the controversial mechanisms of OER process.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5				2198-3844		WOS:000669696000001	34227260

Herein, a frugal and facile approach is reported for decorating MoS2 nanosheets on copper nanorods to design MoS2/Cu architecture as a trifunctional catalyst for electrochemical water splitting and photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Under optimized conditions, MoS2/Cu electrocatalyst shows high performance at an overpotential of 252 mV for oxygen evolution reaction and 160 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction to attain 20 mAcm(-2) and 10 mAcm(-2) current densities in alkaline medium. The improved efficiency is mainly credited to the synergistic effect of MoS2 nanosheets and Cu nanorods architecture. The electrode delivered a cell voltage of similar to 1.508 V to impart about 10 mAcm(-2) current density with high durability. Also, the negligible overpotential decay after running the cell for 12 h with 3000/HER and 2000/OER CV cycles suggests remarkable stability that makes it a promising electrocatalyst for energy production. The photocatalytic CO2 conversion activity was also measured, where MoS2/Cu exhibited a significant efficiency of CO2 to methane conversion (CH4 - 23 mmol g(-1) h(-1)). Based on the obtained results, it is foreseeable that this work validates the significance of transition metals tuning for electrocatalysts and photocatalysts toward more efficient water electrolysis and CO2 reduction for potential large-scale energy applications.

Defect engineering is a promising method to improve the catalytic performance of target materials. In this study, we used a metal-organic framework as a precursor to establish oxygen-vacancy-rich metal oxide groups supported by a defect-rich carbon framework via calcination. Further, thermal ion exchange was performed to introduce sulfur ions to generate NiCoMnSx-10 with both oxygen vacancies and sulfur defects. Due to the synergistic effect between oxygen vacancies and sulfur defects as well as the good morphology, NiCoMnSx-10 exhibited good catalytic performance at high current densities. The NiCoMnSx-10 cell could achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.506 V and a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 1.94 V, which exceeds that of most materials reported to date. Due to the supporting effect of N, S co-doped carbon, the NiCoMnSx-10 cell maintained stable performance during a 100 h operation at high current. This work provides an innovative method for the preparation of highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1466-8033			WOS:000573314200014

The studied sites were chosen based on a previous study of the same systems utilizing a thermodynamic model which ignored both solvent effects and kinetic barriers. According to that model, the two studied sites, one on a singly nitrogen-doped CNT and the other on a doubly doped CNT, were approximately equally suitable for OER. For the four-step OER process, however, our reaction barrier calculations showed a clear difference in the rate-determining *OOH formation step between the two systems, with barrier heights differing by more than 0.4 eV. Thus, the simple thermodynamic model may alone be insufficient for identifying optimal OER sites. Of the remaining three reaction steps, the two H2O forming ones were found to be barrierless in all cases. We also performed solvent-free barrier calculations on NCNTs and undoped CNTs. Substantial differences were observed in the energies of the intermediates when the solvent was present. In general, the observed low activation energy barriers for these reactions corroborate both experimental and theoretical findings of the utility of NCNTs for OER catalysis.									20	0	0	0	0	0	19			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000436381600033	30405870

However, the practical application of ZABs is hindered by their low power density and poor rechargeability, which arises from the sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on air cathode. Herein, a high-power, wearable ZAB with impressive electrochemical performances is achieved based on a new NiFe nanoparticles embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (NiFe/N-CNT) as bifunctional electrocatalyst. The in-situ Raman and oxygen adsorption and DFT calculations reveal that our designed NiFe/N-CNT catalyst can remarkably promote the oxygen adsorption in ORR and OH- adsorption in OER, which enable this NiFe/N-CNT to own superior electrocatalytic activity toward both OER and ORR. The as-fabricated wearable ZAB with the NiFe/N-CNT as air cathode exhibits an ultrahigh open-circuit potential (Voc) of 1.41 V and a remarkable high peak power density of 105.4 mW cm(-2), Furthermore, it also obtains a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.61 V and superior durability for 800 min. This research provides a new design pathway for the electrocatalysts for high-performance rechargeable and wearable metal-air batteries.									124	11	0	0	5	0	124			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000513811800050

It is still challenging to develop ideal electrocatalysts to substitute the commercial noble metal-based materials. In this work, we have constructed a new material, CoP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated by a biomolecule-derived N, P-codoped carbon nanosheets via a simple and facile one-step strategy. The as-prepared material releases a high electrocatalytic activity and stability for OER, with an overpotential of 310 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH. Importantly, we found that the phosphoric acid can not only introduce phosphorus dopant into 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets and play a role of pore-forming agent, but also participate in the formation of active center (cobalt phosphide). Moreover, the coverage of N, P-doped carbon can prevent the CoP nanoparticles from corrosion under the harsh reaction medium to achieve high and stable activity. We believe that our strategy can offer a novel pathway to synthesize new transition metal-based catalysts for electrocatalysis or other heterogeneous catalysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2296-2646			WOS:000508836000001	31998679

Most reported catalysts are composed of three or fewer metallic components. The inherent complexity of multicomponent TMPs with more than four metallic components hinders their investigation in rationally designing the structure and, more importantly, comprehending the component-activity correlation. Through hydrothermal growth and subsequent phosphorization, we reported a facile strategy for combining TMPs with tunable elemental compositions (Ni, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu) on a two-dimensional titanium carbide (MXene) flake. The obtained TMPs/MXene hybrid nanostructures demonstrate homogeneously distributed elements. They exhibit high electrical conductivity and strong interfacial interaction, resulting in an accelerated reaction kinetics and long-term stability. The results of different component catalysts' OER performance show that NiFeMnCoP/MXene is the most active catalyst, with a low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA center dot cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 41.43 mV center dot dec(-1), and a robust long-term electrochemical stability. According to the electrocatalytic mechanism investigation, the enhanced NiFeMnCoP/MXene OER performance is due to the strong synergistic effect of the multi-elemental composition. Our work, therefore, provides a scalable synthesis route for multi-elemental TMPs and a valuable guideline for efficient MXene-supported catalysts design.									4	3	0	0	0	0	4			1674-4799	1869-103X		WOS:000749312300012

Herein, 1D Co3S4/MoS2 bimetallic sulfide nanorods (Co3S4/MoS2 NRs) were prepared using MoO3 nanorods and ZIF-67 as the precursors. As-prepared Co3S4/MoS2 NRs showed excellent HER and OER activity, including low overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2) (116 and 280 mV) and Tafel slopes (59 and 52 mV dec(-1)). Furthermore, the density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the introduction of Co3S4 is conducive to reducing H2O dissociation during the HER process. In addition, Co3S4 also can effectively regulate the d orbital electrons of Mo in MoS2, which is beneficial for optimizing the H adsorption energy, thus enhancing the HER performance. Benefitting from excellent OER and HER activities, the Co3S4/MoS2 NR based-electrolyzer for overall water spitting exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.66 V to reach 20 mA cm(-2) along with good stability.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000774182900001

However, the serious challenges facing LOBs are the sluggish oxygen redox kinetics during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process, resulting in poor specific capacity and inferior cyclability. Herein, we fabricate phosphorus vacancies enriched Ni2P nanosheets on carbon cloth (denoted as V-p-Ni2P@CC) via a simple NaBH (4) reduction strategy as oxygen electrode for high-performance LOBs. Interestingly, the V-p-Ni2P@CC based LOBs exhibit outstanding performance including large specific capacity (10 796 mA h g(-1)@4500 mA g(-1)) and excellent cyclability (235 cycles@500 mA g(-1)) compared with LOBs with the Ni2P@CC electrode. It is found that the abundant phosphorus vacancies in the V-p-Ni2P@CC not only act as active sites for oxygen electrode reactions but also enhance the mobility of electron/Li+, simultaneously promoting the improvement of ORR/OER kinetics. Moreover, the restrained electrons around Ni-P bonds are delocalized due to the presence of phosphorus vacancies, which narrow down the band gap in V-p-Ni2P@CC, eventually contributing to high electrical conductivity and excellent electrocatalytic activity. The study provides a new orientation for further developing oxygen electrode catalysts for LOBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Manganese reactions								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				149	5			A558	A569		10.1149/1.1464882				MAY 2002	2002	Lead alloys containing calcium-tin, silver, or similar combinations are the primary insoluble anodes used for copper and zinc electrowinning. One potential concern with these anodes is the detrimental effect on cathode purity from incorporation of lead corrosion products. Other factors which are important to process economics are the reaction potential and overpotential required for oxygen evolution. In addition to the inherent overpotential, impurities in the electrolyte can have a significant polarization impact, such as the films that may form when manganese is present. In order to gain a better understanding of the fundamental behavior of various concentrations of manganese ions at lead anodes, the polarization behavior of lead calcium-tin and lead-silver alloys in sulfuric acid was evaluated. A common depolarizing agent, Co(II), was also used in some cases to determine possible interactions with manganese. The data show that manganese ions are active on the lead anodes and may precipitate manganese oxide in addition to electrochemical deposition. One possible precipitation mechanism seems to occur by the disproportionation of Mn(III). Co(II) lowers the electrode potential at given current densities which decreases Pb corrosion but favors MnO2 formation.

Herein, we adopt a nitrogen doping method to fabricate self-supported N-doped CoO nanowire arrays (N-CoO) as active electrocatalysts via a facile hydrothermal combined doping method. The N-CoO nanowires are strongly composited with the carbon cloth substrate forming free-standing electrode with reinforced stability and high electronic conductivity. Owing to the increased accessible and electroactive areas, rich/short pathways for charge transfer and enhanced electronic conductivity, the N-CoO electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for OER with a low overpotential (319 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )and 410 mV at 100 mA cm(2)) and a low Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) as well as superior long-term stability with no decay in 24h continuous test in alkaline solution. Our reported design and optimization strategy provide a promising way to construct interesting well-aligned arrays for application in energy storage and conversion.

Therefore developing inexpensive, non-hazardous, noble metal free, transition metal oxide based electrocatalyst is necessary for energy application and environmental sustainability. MCo2(III)O4 based oxides in combination of various metal ions (Mn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, Mg2+) are studied as OER electrocatalyst in both acidic and basic medium. When deposited on a glassy carbon current collector the comparative LSV polarization plots revealed that in acidic medium FeCo2O4 is the best OER performing electrocatalyst, showing onset potential +1.62 V vs RHE with current 1.66 mA/cm2, while in basic medium it is MnCo2O4 that preforms the best, showing an onset potential +1.53 V vs RHE with OER current density 2.06 mA/cm2. When nickel foam was used as the current collector, Co3O4 shows the best OER performance, with an onset potential 1.508 V vs RHE and OER current 159 mA/cm2 in acidic medium. However in the basic medium the substrate nickel foam outperforms all the oxides combinations with different metal ions due to partially oxidized NiO at nickel foam, showing onset OER potential +1.58 V vs RHE and OER current density 13mA/cm2. No correlation was found between the rates of OER and the bond dissociation energies of the respective metal-oxygen bonds nor the metal-hydroxide bond strength.

Herein, a novel 3D peony flower-like electrocatalyst was synthesized by employing Mo-Ni2S3/NF nanorod arrays as scaffolds to in situ growth ultrathin NiFe LDH nanosheets (Mo-Ni2S3@NiFe LDH). As expected, the novel peony flower-like Mo-Ni2S3@NiFe LDH displays superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for both OER and HER in alkaline media. Low overpotentials of only 228 mV and 109 mV are required to achieve the current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. Additionally, the material remarkably accelerates water splitting with a low voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2), which outperforms most transition metal electrodes. The outstanding electrocatalytic activity benefits from the following these features: 3D peony flower-like structure with rough surface provides more accessible active Water splitting sites; superhydrophilic surfaces lead to the tight affinity between electrode with electrolyte; metallic Ni substrate and highly conductive Mo-Ni2S3 nanorods scaffold together with offer fast electron transfer; the nanorod arrays and porous Ni foam accelerate gas bubble release and ions transmission; the strong interfacial effect between Mo- doped Ni3S2 and NiFe LDH shortens transport pathway, which are benefit for electrocatalytic performance enhancement. This work paves a new avenue for construction and fabrication the 3D porous structure to boost the intrinsic catalytic activities for energy conversion and storage applications.

However, from the viewpoints of resources, energy and global warming, continuing evolution toward reductant flexibility and CO2 mitigation is desired. This review focuses on the progressive design of an ambitious blast furnace for the future.First, the history of techniques for reducing coke rate and reducing agent in the blast furnace are reviewed. Pulverized coal injection is currently common; however a more innovative process is desired in order to address the global warming issue. The low temperature blast furnace based on charging of high reactivity coke is a realistic process. The combination of the oxygen blast furnace with top gas recycling is also attractive. Although the top gas recycling process based on the oxygen blast furnace is very effective for reducing CO2 emissions, a total evaluation considering the role of the blast furnace to keep the energy self-sufficiency in the integrated steel works is necessary. The oxygen blast furnace enables injection of a large amount of natural gas, and optimized injection of natural gas and pulverized coal makes it possible to mitigate CO2 emissions while maintaining the energy supply to downstream processes. Moreover, owing to the high productivity of the oxygen blast furnace, the blast furnace profile can be down sized. The characteristics of several processes are quantitatively examined, and the concept of the advanced oxygen blast furnace as a next-generation process toward carbon dioxide mitigation is discussed.									27	2	0	0	1	1	29			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000385994400001

In such 3d-metal-based catalysts, the oxidation cycle of 3dmetals has been posited to act as the OER thermodynamic-limiting process; however, further tuning of its energetics is challenging due to similarities among the electronic structures of neighbouring 3dmetal modulators. Here we report a strategy to reprogram the Fe, Co and Ni oxidation cycles by incorporating high-valence transition-metal modulators X (X = W, Mo, Nb, Ta, Re and MoW). We use in situ and ex situ soft and hard X-ray absorption spectroscopies to characterize the oxidation transition in modulated NiFeX and FeCoX oxyhydroxide catalysts, and conclude that the lower OER overpotential is facilitated by the readier oxidation transition of 3dmetals enabled by high-valence modulators. We report an similar to 17-fold mass activity enhancement compared with that for the OER catalysts widely employed in industrial water-splitting electrolysers.									174	6	0	0	10	0	174			2520-1158			WOS:000579724100002

On the basis of a Ni hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) Prussian blue-type coordination polymer, a facile route was developed to fabricate robust Ni/Fe composites for the OER in alkaline electrolyte. The obtained catalysts were characterized by SEM, XRD, FTIR, EDS and XPS methods, and the catalytic activity was evaluated by the electrochemical technique. The Ni/Fe catalyst, which was identified as mixed Ni/Fe oxides, afforded an OER onset overpotential of 310 mV and a Tafel slope of similar to 44 mV per decade in alkaline medium. The Ni/Fe composite also exhibits excellent durability in the electrocatalysis process. No obvious degradation of the OER catalytic density was observed during the cyclic voltammetry (CV) process.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000404609800049

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring at the anode dominates the overall efficiency. Developing active and robust electrocatalysts for OER in acid is a longstanding challenge for PEM water electrolyzers. Most catalysts show unsatisfied stability under strong acidic and oxidative conditions. Such a stability challenge also leads to difficulties for a better understanding of mechanisms. This review aims to provide the current progress on understanding of OER mechanisms in acid, analyze the promising strategies to enhance both activity and stability, and summarize the state-of-the-art catalysts for OER in acid. First, the prevailing OER mechanisms are reviewed to establish the physicochemical structure-activity relationships for guiding the design of highly efficient OER electrocatalysts in acid with stable performance. The reported approaches to improve the activity, from macroview to microview, are then discussed. To analyze the problem of instability, the key factors affecting catalyst stability are summarized and the surface reconstruction is discussed. Various noble-metal-based OER catalysts and the current progress of non-noble-metal-based catalysts are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives for the development of active and robust OER catalysts in acid are discussed.									126	2	0	0	4	0	126			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000632681200001	33768614

Here, we report our recent progress on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by introducing carbon based electrocatalyst as co-catalyst. Cobalt/nitrogen doped graphitic carbon (Co-NG) composite with tubular structure was synthesized by cobalt catalyzed carbonization and graphitization of urea under thermal treatment. Co-NG with strong interaction of cobalt and nitrogen doped graphitic carbon has shown low overpotential for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. It was thus used as co-catalyst for graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4). Beside enhanced light absorption and reduced recombination of Co-NG/g-C3N4 heterostructure composite, high interfacial redox reaction activity of Co-NG was found. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of Co-NG/g-C3N4 was thus effectively improved.									49	4	0	0	6	0	50			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000424719300053

The CoNi alloy/NCNSAs/CC-800 fabricated by pyrolyzing at 800 degrees C exhibits an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, limiting current density) of 6.5 mA cm(-2) and a superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER, at 10 mA cm(-2)) of 1.51 V, as well as a smaller potential difference of 0.676 V between OER and ORR half-wave potential, outperforming previous self-supporting cathodes. Flexible Zn-air batteries (FZABs) assembled with the CoNi alloy/NCNSAs/CC-800 exhibit higher energy density (98.8 mW cm(-2)) and higher capacity (879 mAh g(-1)), as well as excellent mechanical cycle ability (lower voltage gap of 0.66 V during the charge/discharge cycles at flat and folded state), significantly outstripping all other FZABs with self-supporting electrodes currently reported. Such a remarkable performance is ascribed to the 3D hierarchical nanostructure which promotes mass transport, the higher graphitization facilitating electronic mobility and the evenly dispersed active sites which accelerate kinetic reactions. So CoNi alloy/NCNSAs/CC-800 is a promising cathode candidate for ideal wearable energy devices and has great potential application in the field of electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000530456500001	31945747

Here, we report that cobalt phosphonate represents a novel class of bifunctional single-source precursors for highly efficient alkaline electrochemical O-2 evolution (OER) and H-2 evolution reaction (HER). Inspired by its favorable catalytic OER and HER activity, an overall water-splitting device has been constructed from this precursor, showing very low cell voltage (1.62 V @ 10 mA cm(-2)) and excellent long-term stability. Depending on the applied oxidation and reduction potential on cobalt phosphonate, two distinct modified structures at the anode and cathode have been uncovered employing the quasi in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ex situ methods. During OER, the phosphonate precursor reorganized itself to layered CoOx(OH)(y) structure with defects and disorders, while the contribution of the metallic Co along with Co3O4 spinel and Co(OH)(2) is evident to drive the HER. The presented work demonstrates the advantage of using the 'all-in-one' precursor approach to realize bifunctional water-splitting electrocatalysts through the evolution of different species with self-supporting interfacial structural features at the anode and cathode during electrochemical water splitting.									47	1	0	0	0	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000521200000037		
J	Zhou, Keyu; Fo, Yumeng; Zhou, Xin								First-principles calculations of the structural, energetic, electronic, optical, and photocatalytic properties of BaTaO2N low-index surfaces								NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY				46	24			11540	11552		10.1039/d2nj01191c		MAY 2022		JUN 20 2022	2022	We present here the influence of different surface terminations on the electronic, optical, and photocatalytic properties of trans and cis BaTaO2N using density functional theory calculations. For each surface, we consider two complementary terminations exposed with Ba and Ta atoms, respectively. The calculated surface energies suggest that (001) and (100) are more stable than other low-index surfaces. Work functions are distinct for various surface terminations, which can be attributed to the atomic displacements in different directions and degrees after relaxation. We propose that the transferring direction of the photogenerated carriers in BaTaO2N-based heterostructures could be controlled by obtaining the preferred surface termination. The simulated absorption spectra suggest that both trans and cis BaTaO2N exhibit optical anisotropy, which could result from the difference in relaxed crystal parameters along different directions. Dissociative water adsorption on both the (001) and (100) terminations is thermodynamically favorable. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is easier to occur on the terminations exposed with Ta, O, and N simultaneously. The computed overpotentials of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for trans-(001)-BaO, cis-(001)-TaON, cis-(001)-BaO, and cis-(100)-Ta2O3N are in good agreement with the experimental results. These findings provide important insights into the rational design of (001)- and (100)-oriented BaTaO2N samples for enhanced photocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000802660700001		
J	POTVIN, E; BROSSARD, L								OXYGEN EVOLUTION ON ELECTROCHEMICALLY GENERATED COBALT SPINEL COATING								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				25	5			462	471						MAY 1995	1995	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been investigated in 40wt% KOH at 80 degrees C on a thick cobalt oxide coating obtained by potential cycling of a cobalt electrode for 0, 2, 4, 10 and 17 h in the same electrolyte with and without dissolved strontium. The kinetic parameters of the OER were determined after preanodization for 1 h at 1 A cm(-2). Improved electrocatalytic activity for the OER, better mechanical strength of the coating and lower variation of the oxygen overpotential with time were noticed up to 70 h of polarization as the coating built up in the presence of dissolved strontium in the electrolyte. The beneficial effect of dissolved strontium on the electrocatalytic activity is ascribed to the accumulation of Co3O4, which results in a lower Tafel slope for the OER.									21	3	0	0	1	0	23			0021-891X			WOS:A1995QY92800006

Ternary IrO2-Sb2O5-SnO2 and cobalt-based oxides have been suggested to be high stability and low cost electrocatalysts for OER in acid and basic aqueous solution, respectively. Herein, we develop a serial of Ti/CoOx-IrO2-Sb2O5-SnO2 anodes by a simple thermal treatment of mixed metal chlorides on Ti substrate. It is found that the partial-substitution iridium by cobalt in Ti/Ir0.1Sb0.1Sn0.8Ox (Ti/C0ISS) anode shows an improved OER activity in acid and basic solution. For a Ti/Ir0.05Co0.05Sb0.1Sn0.8Ox (Ti/C5ISS) anode, small overpotentials of 0.438 and 0.498 V are needed under the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M KOH, respectively. These values are remarkably lower than those of Ti/C0ISS electrode and comparable to other nanometer metal oxides catalysts. Additionally, it exhibits a low Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and displays excellent electrocatalytic durability for OER in alkaline solution under a high current density. These advantages indicate Ti/C5ISS is a promising anode for water oxidation under high current densities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Rapid cyclic voltammetry at a polarization rate of 1 V/s between anodic and cathodic potentials in 0.1M HClO4 and 1M KOH reveals the growth of a thin film of oxygen-rich niobia covering the catalyst and support particles. Step-increase cyclic voltammetry and chronopotentiostatic coulometry approaching, at, and above the oxygen evolution potential suggests that the mechanism of 3D film growth is oxygen-dependent. Density Functional Theory calculations indicate that the rate of oxygen diffusion across the Pt(111) surface is in good agreement with experimental observations of the period of catalyst deactivation (several weeks) when exposed to open atmosphere. This suggests that the mechanism of catalytic deactivation (passivation) could involve the capture and release of oxygen as Nb2O5 breaks down into reduced fragments of NbOx.

Regardless, the anodic half-reaction of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is considered a kinetic bottleneck. This study provides quantitative description of the OER kinetics based on rigorous microkinetic analyses including Tafel analysis, isotope effects and temperature dependence using an IrOx electrocatalyst in unbuffered solution at varying pH levels. The diffusional constraints of H+/OHdetermine three distinctive kinetic regimes in the pH-potential-current relationships: below pH 5, between pH 5 and 10, and above pH 10 at appreciable current densities on the order of 1 mA cm(-2). When shifting from alkaline to acidic solution, the complete consumption of local OHnear the electrode surface switches the OER proceeding as the oxidation of OHto that of the water molecule at pH 11 irrespective of the electrode identity. At pH 5-10, the diffusional constraints of H+ generated via oxidation reaction yield an environment with pH 4 near the electrode surface even prior to the OER, resulting in a bulk pH-independent region for the OER performance. Under this unbuffered near-neutral pH condition, the isotope effect was diminished for the OER catalysis, which is consistent with the rate determining step (rds) being the sole electron-transfer step via the formation of O-O bonds, decoupled from proton transfer. This reaction mechanism is distinct from that under more acidic conditions (pH < 4), although the water molecule is the same reactant. Under acidic conditions, noticeable isotope effects were observable, which is consistent with the formation of O-O bonds being the rds on uncoordinated bare Ir sites as the most abundant surface species. This study provides a quantitative description of the reactantand mechanistic-switching that points to concurrent optimization of both electrode materials and electrolyte for improved OER performance at near-neutral pH levels.

In this work, PEC photoanodes consisting of GaAs nanowire (NW) arrays were fabricated, characterized, and then demonstrated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Uniform and periodic GaAs nanowire arrays were grown on a heavily n-doped GaAs substrates by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition selective area growth. The nanowire arrays were characterized using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy in a non-aqueous electrochemical system using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as a redox couple, and a maximum oxidation photocurrent of 11.1 mA/cm(2) was measured. GaAs NW arrays with a 36 nm layer of nickel oxide (NiO (x) ) synthesized by atomic layer deposition were then used as photoanodes to drive the OER. In addition to acting as an electrocatalyst, the NiO (x) layer served to protect the GaAs NWs from oxidative corrosion. Using this strategy, GaAs NW photoanodes were successfully used for the oxygen evolution reaction. This is the first demonstration of GaAs NW arrays for effective OER, and the fabrication and protection strategy developed in this work can be extended to study any other nanostructured semiconductor materials systems for electrochemical solar energy conversion.					59th Electronic Materials Conference (EMC)59th Electronic Materials Conference (EMC)	JUN 28-30, 2017JUN 28-30, 2017		Univ Notre Dame, South Bend, INUniv Notre Dame, South Bend, IN	6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000419791800005

The electrochemical behavior of n-type sulfur-doped nanocrystalline chemical-vapor-deposited diamond films was such that the current corresponding to the electrochemical hydrogen evolution decreased reversibly in the presence of dissolved oxygen in the solution, in contrast to the behavior of the p-type materials, boron-doped (microcrystalline) and undoped (nanocrystalline) diamonds. For the sulfur-doped film, we propose that the presence of oxygen at the interface may cause a decrease in the number of majority carrier electrons near the surface. The influence of the doping levels of sulfur in the diamond films on the films' oxygen sensitivities was examined in detail. We propose that the electron transfer activity, modulated by the concentration of oxygen dissolved in an aqueous solution, necessitates the development of a model for the electrochemical behavior of the types of diamond films examined in the present work.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4651			WOS:000265737600065

The main application is in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), in which layered materials could possibly replace platinum. Although platinum offers both the lowest overpotential and the highest current density, it is also expensive and rare and has little tolerance to passivation. On the other hand, metal diborides are well known for their high chemical stability and low cost. Surprisingly, until now, only a few electrochemical properties of diborides have been studied. In this paper, we present the study of the electrocatalytic properties of metal borides (namely AlB2, CrB2, HfB2, MgB2, NbB2, TaB2, TiB2, VB2 and ZrB2) towards the HER and ORR together with their structural and chemical characterization.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000436133400036	29892762

Most of the reported methods require complicated fabrication steps, therefore increasing the usage of hazardous chemicals and cost as well. Herein, we report a BiVO4 homojunction with abundant oxygen vacancies fabricated by a surface crystal orientation reconstruction induced by one step Mo doping method. After Mo doping, a few nanometer BVO with crystal orientation of (1 21) is formed on BVO (1 1 0) surface with abundant oxygen vacancies on BVO photoanode. Mo doped BiVO4 photoanode (Mo:BVO) exhibits an obvious improvement of photocurrent (similar to 1.63 folds) compared with the pristine BVO. Using graphene as the hole extraction layer and CoPi as the cocatalysts, CoPi/Gr/Mo:BVO photoanode shows a high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with the onset potential of 0.3 V vs. RHE and photocurrent of 4.36 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE under AM 1.5 G illumination. This work provides a promising strategy for the design of high-performance BiVO(4 )photoelectrodes.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000663677900007

Chemiluminescence from the B2SIGMA-X2SIGMA and the A2PI-X2SIGMA YO electronic states, produced by the reaction Y+O2, is measured. The intensity of the A2PI3/2 band is monitored as a function of pressure, distance from the target, and laser fluence. Hydrodynamic effects have a significant influence on the spatial and temporal evolution of the YO emission in the plume, which is governed by the dynamics of the shock wave generated in the excimer ablation. This shock wave compresses the ambient oxygen and leaves a trough of rarefied oxygen in its wake.									27	0	0	0	0	0	27			0021-8979			WOS:A1993LE95200116

The interface interaction between components is one of the most important factors that affects the catalytic activity of electrode materials. Herein, N and P co-doped hollow carbon fibers embedded with molybdenum phosphide nanoparticles (MoP@N, P-HCF) are elaborately fabricated as novel bifunctional electrocatalysts to study the influence of interface interaction on oxygen redox reactions in zinc-air batteries. As evidenced, a strong electron transfer is realized at the interface between N, P-HCF and MoP NPs due to their remarkable interfacial interaction, enabling the uniform combination of the nanoparticles with the doped carbonaceous matrix. More importantly, the rearrangement of electrons along the heterogeneous interface in MoP@N, P-HCF endows the electrode with abundant active sites and excellent catalytic activity, thus promoting the kinetics of the oxygen electrode reactions. Based on the above merits, MoP@N, P-HCF based rechargeable zinc-air batteries demonstrate improved power density of 93.8 mW cm(-2) and superior cyclability of over 600 cycles. Our work emphasizes the significant role of interface chemistry between conductive carbon matrix and transition metal compounds in regulating the catalytic activity and provides a profound insight for the development of highly active and stable oxygen electrode materials.

Rietveld analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) data showed that the tetragonal distortion of the NiO6 octahedra decreased monotonically with an increase of x, while the Ln (Sr)-O (//c-axis) in the rock-salt block was expanded with an increase in x, although the tetragonality, c/alpha showed a maximum at x = 0.6. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements showed that the activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) increased with x, while that of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was independent of x. The characteristic peak due to oxygen insertion into the lattice was observed at ca. 1.45 V vs. RHE, the intensity of which increased with the Sr content, which reflects the increase in the internal chemical diffusion of oxygen species. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements for the constituent elements confirmed the presence of OH- groups inside the catalyst particles, especially in the Sr-rich region. It is suggested that the reversible intercalation ability of the OH- group into the rock-salt layer in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase (A(n+1)B(n)O(3n+1)) contributes significantly to the improvement of the OER activity.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0167-2738	1872-7689		WOS:000687183100003

Herein, we report a simple pyrolysis method to construct the ternary FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles that encapsulated with bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). By combining the advantages of FeCoNi alloy with N-CNTs, the as-fabricated FeCoNi@N-CNTs have large active surface area, ultrahigh content of graphitic carbon, and abundant active metal-C/N-x species to show better electrocatalytic performance for OER in alkaline media. The optimized Fe1Co1Ni1@N-CNTs displays perfect electrocatalytic performance toward OER with an unexpectedly small onset potential of 1.43 V and an ultralow overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as remarkable long-time stability in alkaline media. More importantly, by coupling Fe1Co1Ni1@N-CNTs as the anode electrode, our previous reported Fe1Co3Mo3 P-O as cathode electrode, a potential of only 1.62 V is needed to drive the water electrolysis to reach to the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable to the state-of-the-art IrO2 parallel to Pt/C couple.

Herein, controllable synthesis of a newly developed 2D Ni-based MOF nanoplates in well-defined rectangle morphology is first realized via a pyridine-assisted bottom-up solvothermal treatment of NiSO4 and 4,4-bipyridine. The thickness of the MOF nanoplates can be controlled to below 20 nm, while the lateral size can be tuned in a wide range with different amounts of pyridine. Subsequent pyrolysis treatment converts the MOF nanoplates into 2D free-standing nitrogen-doped Ni-Ni3S2@carbon nanoplates. The obtained Ni-Ni3S2 nanoparticles encapsulated in the N-doped carbon matrix exhibits high electrocatalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction. A low overpotential of 284.7 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is achieved in alkaline solution, which is among the best reported performance of substrate-free nickel sulfides based nanomaterials.									73	10	0	0	4	0	74			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000472199500009	30957975

Because aqueous acidic H2PtCl6 solution was used as a doping precursor, Cl- ions were generated during imposing high positive voltage (so-called potential shock), which would aggressively damage the anodic oxide if a normal potential shock were applied. Instead, the novel underpotential shock method allowed Pt to be homogeneously doped into TiO2 films without destroying the structures. Pt could not thoroughly penetrate the barrier oxide into the interface between the oxide and Ti metal because the voltage of the potential shock was lower than the anodizing voltage, which determines the thickness of barrier oxide. Thus, a high amount of Pt was doped in the outer region of the barrier oxide. In the water splitting application, both the HER and OER were greatly enhanced when catalyzed by TiO2 that was doped with Pt at 10 V in 2 mM H2PtCl6 for 10 s.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000361868400024

In this work, a kind of two-dimensional ultrathin manganese (Mn) doped polyhedral cobalt phosphide (Mn-CoP) has been synthesized via the etching-carbonization-phosphidation of Co-centered metal-organic frameworks. The as-prepared porous Mn-CoP nanosheets had a larger specific surface area and higher porosity, furnishing them with more plentiful catalytically active sites than their counterpart hollow CoP and Mn-CoP nanoparticles, and thus showed much better electrocatalytic activity for both HER and OER in acidic and alkaline media. In addition, the Mn-CoP nanosheets also demonstrated excellent durability after long-term operation. These high performances are attributed to the synergistic effects of the CoP nanosheets with intrinsic activity, the graphitic carbon and the controllable electronic structure doped by Mn and N elements. This synthetic methodology of using a classical MOF as a precursor to build a new 2D sheet-like composite may create opportunities to search for highly efficient and robust non-precious metal catalysts for energy-related reactions.									78	1	0	0	3	0	78			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000454842000037	30277490

Generally, the deep oxidation of CNTs to form oxygen-containing groups on their surface is indispensable before combining them with TMPs. However, such approaches inevitably introduce a large number of defects to CNTs and apparently decrease their stability and electrical conductivity. Hence, fabricating TMP-CNT composites which does not come at the expense of CNTs' high electrical conductivity is quite desirable. In this work, alkylated CNTs (named as ACNT) functionalized via the Birch reaction are used to prepare the pearl necklace-like NiCo2P2-ACNT composites for electrocatalysts toward HER in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscope, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations indicate that the ACNTs are well modified with functional groups and keep their structural integrity, thereby maximizing their excellent conductivity. Compared to bare NiCo2P2 and the NiCo2P2-CNT composites prepared with mildly oxidized CNTs and deeply oxidized CNTs, the NiCo2P2-ACNTs show far better HER performance and much faster kinetics.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000453859100006	30450810

Herein, by using the synergistic effect of pyrrole and cobalt, we synthesized a catalyst-cobalt nanoparticle-embedded pyrrole-doped hollow porous carbon nanofiber (Co-Py/HMPCNF) by a convenient electrospinning and high-temperature calcination route. We found that the addition of pyrrole significantly improved the ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) and OER (oxygen evolution reaction) activities of the catalyst, and the optimized Co-Py(1.5mL)/HMPCNF-900 (with a pyrrole content of 1.5 mL and a carbonization temperature of 900 degrees C) exhibited a positive onset potential (1.055 V) for ORR and OER showed excellent oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability in terms of low overpotential (0.36 V at 10 mA cm-2), the RZABs constructed using Co-Py(1.5mL)/HMPCNF-900 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 1.42 V, which is comparable to the Pt/C system, and its stability still does not fail after 278 h, which is better than that of the Pt/C catalyst. A detailed comparison of Co-Py(1.5mL)/HMPCNF-900 with other similar catalyst studies (Table S2) shows that Co-Py(1.5mL)/HMPCNF-900-based catalyst has great potential for practical application of RZABs and it is worth mentioning that the preparation process of this catalyst is simple and inexpensive.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9635	1879-0062		WOS:000822969400005

Vibrations were observed in hot models due to cyclic formation of large volumes of carbon monoxide and their emersion at the bath surface. A mathematical model for the formation of a large volume of carbon monoxide, and refinements to the mechanism of gas evolution in the secondary reaction zone were suggested. The pulse-like gas evolution is shown to generate a spherical longitudinal wave that propagates in the liquid metal and the lining, giving rise to vibrations of the steelmaking furnace. The assumption that the decarburization rate influences the furnace vibrations is supported by relationships found for the vibration intensity change during bubbling in a oxygenblown converter of a vacuum degassing furnace. Changes in the vibration level at characteristic frequencies were employed to monitor carbon oxidation process during oxygen blowing in steelmaking furnaces.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0543-5846			WOS:A1997WT21900002

The results show that Nd doping can lead to fine grains of surfaces and full crystals, promote RuO2 enrichment, and increase the active sites. Catalytic performance of the mixed oxide electrodes containing 20:1 Nd-doping content is the best, with the greatest voltammetric charge, 686 mC.cm(-2), and the lowest apparent activation energy for oxygen evolution, 16.76 kJ/mol. The increase of binding force between the electrode substrate and the coating contribute to a longer electrode life than the blank electrode, reaching to 158 h.									2	4	0	0	0	0	5			1002-185X			WOS:000301216500012

The composites' formation improved the surface-electrochemistry of Pd nanoparticles to carry out the OER. XRD and TEM reveal a crystallite size increase and a crystal lattice distortion for LEEL-037/Pd-C composites. LEEL-037/Pd-C samples containing 25 and 50 wt% LEEL-037 show an improvement of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) due to a structural interaction that enhances the electrocatalytic activity of bare materials. Based on the electrochemical and XPS results, a charge-transfer mechanism is proposed to explain an improvement of the OH(-)adsorption degree on the LEEL-037/Pd-C composites. Since OER activity in alkaline medium is directly related to the initial OH(-)adsorption process, LEEL-037/Pd-C composites enhance their OER electrocatalytic activity. The composite LEEL-037(25)/Pd-C(75) exhibited the lowest operational potential to reach 10 mA cm(-2) (1.66 V); additionally, the EIS measurements show that it exhibited the lowest charge-transfer resistance. Insights into this reaction mechanism and charge-transfer process become a promising strategy to tailor the electrochemical activity towards the OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				1466-8033		WOS:000637384100001

However, most perovskites have poor electrical conductivity at room temperature. Here, to simultaneously enhance the activity and stability towards both OER and HER, we in situ-introduce carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the perovskite (SrTi0.1Fe0.85Ni0.05O3_delta) surface via a simple chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. First, we evaluate the influence of the CVD temperature on the growth of the CNTs. The optimized electrocatalyst obtained at a temperature of 700 degrees C (denoted as STFN/CNT-700) exhibits higher OER and HER activities than the bare perovskite, which is reflected by the current density, onset potential, overpotential and Tafel slope, and thus we construct a homemade electrolyzer for overall water splitting using STFN/CNT-700 as both an anode and cathode in alkaline electrolyte. Lastly, the increased performances are mainly attributed to the improved charge transfer process, increased surface area, and synergistic effect between the perovskite phase and the CNTs phase.

Here, beta-like FeOOH nanosword structures encapsulated by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) were cost-effectively synthesized on formable Ni foam substrates as an efficient and highly durable OER catalyst. It is revealed that the rGO uniformly covered the beta-like FeOOH nanoswords to form a porous network achieving a lower overpotential of only 210 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a stable operation for more than 40 h in alkali media. Moreover, a high current density of similar to 300 mA cm(-2) was achieved at less than 1.8 V. In-depth physical and electrochemical analysis indicated that the intrinsic charge transfer through activated Ni-foam, beta-like phase, and nanosword morphology was evidently beneficial for enhancing the OER activity of the bare FeOOH, and its encapsulation by rGO further improved the conductivity and long-life durability. Our integrated OER electrocatalyst developed by a simple method (repeated soaking and quenching process) will aid in scaling up beta-like FeOOH nanoswords for preparing uniform and large-area electrodes for industrial purposes.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000645520700036	33856769

In this communication, we report the surface engineering of a CoMoO4 nanoplate array on nickel foam (CoMoO4 NPAs/NF) by CoMoO4 nanoparticle decoration. The hierarchical structure of the as-formed CoMoO4 NP@PAs/NF (CoMoO4 nanoparticle coated nanoplate array on Ni foam) guarantees the exposure of more catalytically active sites with a much larger electrochemically active surface area, leading to improved catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In 1 M KOH, it needs a low overpotential of 317 mV to attain 100 mA cm(-2), 72 mV less than that for CoMoO4 NPAs/NF. Moreover, this system is also durable with a twice higher turnover frequency (TOF) value of 0.41 s(-1) at 400 mV overpotential compared with CoMoO4 NPAs/NF.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000526855200003

A theoretical approach using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method was employed to model the time evolution of the reaction. Two potential surfaces available in the literature were used in the calculations, and the results obtained with the two surfaces are compared with each other as well as with results of a previous theoretical time-independent approach. A good agreement for the reaction probabilities with the previous theoretical results is found. Comparing the results obtained using two potential energy surfaces allows us to understand the role of the reef/shoulder-like feature in the minimum energy path of the reaction in the isotope exchange process. Also, it was found that the distribution of final products of the reaction is highly anisotropic, which agrees with experimental observations and, at the same time, suggests that the family of approximated statistical approaches, assuming a randomized distribution over final exit channels, is not applicable to this case.									26	0	5	0	0	0	30			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000486361100007	31408343

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), dual electrode voltammetry (DECV) and chronoamperometry (CA) by rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) were carried out to investigate the catalytic activity of this catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results revealed that the layered nanosphere NiO exhibited excellent electrochemical performance, stability and a typical four-electron reaction as a cathode electrocatalyst for rechargeable nonaqueous Li-O-2 batteries. The overpotential of the NiO is only up to 0.61 V. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization shows that the Li2O2 and Li2CO3 formed during the discharge process and decomposed after charging. Moreover, the cut-off voltage of discharging is about 2.0 V in the NiO-based Li-O-2 batteries, while the specific capacity is up to 3040 mA h g(-1). There is no obvious performance decline of the battery after 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 mA cm(-2) with a superior limited specific capacity of 800 mA h g(-1). Herein, the layered nanosphere structured NiO catalyst is considered a promising cathode electrocatalyst for Li-O-2 batteries.									9	1	0	0	1	0	9				2046-2069		WOS:000423348500001	35542920

Electron spin polarization and increasing the reaction temperature are considered as potential ways to promote alkaline OER. Here, it is reported that in the alkaline OER process under an AC magnetic field, a ferromagnetic ordered electrocatalyst can simultaneously act as a heater and a spin polarizer to achieve significant OER enhancement at a low current density. Moreover, its effect obviously precedes antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, and diamagnetic electrocatalysts. In particular, the non-corrected overpotential of the ferromagnetic electrocatalyst Co at 10 mA cm(-2) is reduced by a maximum of 36.6% to 243 mV at 4.320 mT. It is found that the magnetic heating effect is immediate, and more importantly, it is localized and hardly affects the temperature of the entire electrolytic cell. In addition, the spin pinning effect established on the ferromagnetic/paramagnetic interface generated during the reconstruction of the ferromagnetic electrocatalyst expands the ferromagnetic order of the paramagnetic layer. Also, the introduction of an external magnetic field further increases the orderly arrangement of spins, thereby promoting OER. This work provides a reference for the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts under a magnetic field.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000835672500001	35862430

Herein, for the first time, a facile and ultrafast synthetic method has been reported to fabricate nickel sulfide (Ni3S2) films on Ni foam (Ni3S2/NF) as efficient bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting through direct dropping of mercaptoethanol solution followed by annealing at 300 degrees C for only 50 s. Thanks to the integrated three-dimensional (3D) configuration, the obtained Ni3S2/Ni foam exhibits excellent activity and stability for HER and OER with low overpotentials of 131 and 312 mV, respectively, to attain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Ni(OH)(x) species formed on the Ni3S2 surface serves as the actual catalytic site during OER reaction. Given the well-defined bifunctionality, an overall water-splitting device using two identical Ni3S2/NF electrodes delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.68 V in an alkaline water electrolyzer. This approach is promising as a simple method for depositing a wide range of useful transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts on corresponding metal substrate bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, shedding some light on the development of functional materials in energy chemistry.									66	0	0	0	6	0	66			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000450932100045	30198033

One way to improve the catalyst mass activity and thus to lower costs is to increase the number of active sites per surface area, for example, by nano-confining the catalyst. Here, we systematically investigate Pd and Ir monoatomic island formation based on Cu underpotential deposition and subsequent metal displacement on Au(1 1 1). We find that island size and dispersion can be controlled by Cu deposition potential and duration. We examine how the hydrogen evolution reaction on the as-prepared 2D Pd or Ir islands on Au(1 1 1) can be tuned by selectively tuning island size and inter-island distance on the nanoscale. The HER charge density of the islands was found to show a maximum for intermediate deposition times.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000692249500006

Here, we propose a Z-scheme photocatalyst by embedding Pd(OH)(2)- and Co(OH)(2)-groups in different parts of g-CN simultaneously. Density functional theory calculations show that it extends solar light absorption of g-CN into visible and infrared regions, realizes efficient charge separation, and can catalyze water splitting to produce O-2 and H-2, respectively. The staggered band alignment meets the requirement of the Z-scheme. Importantly, ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the photogenerated hole evolution accords with anticipation for subsequent water-splitting reactions. The computed Gibbs-free energy and overpotentials confirm the feasibility of hydrogen evolution reactions on the Co-centered fragment and oxygen evolution reactions on the Pd-centered fragment, respectively. It is expected that this new Z-scheme model designed on a single material platform may provide an alternative way for achieving efficient photodriven water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000457067500036

In this paper, we have prepared pristine Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) and Co3O4-C polyhedrons via two different calcination strategies. Then we have also displayed a simple and green reduction method to synthesize reduced Co3O4 (R-Co3O4) polyhedron with abundant surface oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies and the doping of carbon species can enhance conductivity of electrocatalysts, thus, improving their electrocatalytic activities obviously. R-Co3O4 and Co3O4-C polyhedrons show lower overpotentials of 380 and 420 mV, respectively, compared to P-Co3O4 polyhedron (520 mV) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution (pH 13.7). And they also have smaller Tafel slopes of 86 and 78 mV dec(-1) than that of P-Co3O4 polyhedron (93 mV dec(-1)), respectively. The integrated strategy reported here provides the way to design high-performance electrocatalysts for water oxidation.									24	0	0	0	2	0	24			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000418294200033

The CoMo/CP catalyst was optimized for the alkaline HER by controlling the electrodeposition bath conditions, po-tential, and time. The optimized catalyst shows the heterohierarchical structure containing the electrically conductive metallic Co in the bulk and Mo-incorporated Co containing Mo4+ at the surface. It exhibited a lower HER overpotential of 0.11 V at-20 mA/cm(2) compared to those of the others owing to the synergetic effect of the between the Co and Mo incorporated Co.

Herein, we present a new hydrothermal method based on integrating NiCo-Layered Double Hydroxides (NiCo-LDHs) with Molybdenum Sulfide (MoS2) to develop a three-dimensional (3D) MoS2/NiCo2S4 nanostructure supported on Nickel Foam (NF). To optimize the interfacial structure and promote the catalytic activity, the molar ratio of MoS2/NiCo2S4 is used to regulate the hybrids' nanostructure. The optimal MoS2/NiCo2S4/NF is obtained as the molar ratio reaches 20%, which can be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with ultrahigh electrocatalytic property for HER and OER in alkaline electrolyte. As expected, the optimize MoS2/NiCo2S4/NF shows an overpotential as small as 90 and 220 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER in 1 M KOH. Additionally, an electrolyzer is assembled where MoS2/NiCo2S4/NF serves as anode and cathode electrode, the current densities achieve 10 mA cm(-2) only need a cell potential of 1.49 V.

Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe, Co and P as well as enlarged electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), the resultant Fe-Co2P nanoparticles yield extraordinary OER performance with an overpotential as low as 289 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 40 mV dec(-1), and excellent OER stability, which are superior to the individual Co2P, Fe2P as well as the commercial RUO2 electrocatalyst. Moreover, Fe-Co2P nanoparticles are also shown to be a resultful co-catalyst to promote the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation performance of alpha-Fe2O3 photoanode, leading to a cathodic potential shift of similar to 200 mVat 1.0 mA cm(-2) and a significantly promoted photocurrent density of 1.40 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V-RHE with respect to that of bare alpha-Fe2O3.

Under high pressure, hydrogen incorporation into the Fe2O3 lattice has been achieved, and hydrogen dopants can be released with heat treatment. With H-doping, magnetite Fe3O4 has been found to form at the edge of Fe2O3 nanoparticles. H-incorporation can narrow the band gap by similar to 0.4 eV and slightly reduce the overpotential (by 140 mV) for oxygen evolution reaction, but due to the localization of hydrogen (bonded with oxygen), a slightly lower charge carrier density resulted. Computational studies reveal that all of the above changes are essentially related to the local states brought by H-dopants. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the optical, electronic, and catalytic properties of hydrogenated Fe2O3.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1932-7447			WOS:000407189400001

However, the current techniques for large-scale electrochemical hydrogen production rely on the use of expensive and scarce noble-metal catalysts making it uncompetitive to traditional methods using fossil fuels. Thus, replacing noble-metal electrocatalysts with cheap materials made of abundant elements holds the key to achieve the cost-effectiveness. Recently, amorphous electrocatalysts emerged as promising candidates due to their unique physical and chemical properties compared with their crystalline counterparts leading to superior catalytic performance. Given the rapid advances made in the design, synthesis, and development of amorphous catalysts, namely monometallic and multimetallic borides, sulfides, phosphides, oxides, and hydroxides based on transition metals, the recent progress on compositional designs, microstructure, morphology, electronic properties, and interaction with host materials are reviewed critically. Special attention is paid to uncover the main strategies adopted in each material category and the underlying structure-property relationship that lead to improved hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. As a result, guidance for the design and synthesis of novel amorphous electrocatalysts with high performance for large-scale electrochemical water splitting application is provided.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			2699-9412			WOS:000783855400009

In this work, three-dimensional hierarchical Mn-Co-P/NF electrodes on nickel foam are synthesized by electrodeposition and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) firstly. Provide an excellent and controllable synthesis method by controlling the electrodeposition time and phosphating temperature. The Mn-Co-P composite exhibits the characteristics of vertically grown porous nanosheets, which can effectively expose the active sites. Benefit from the rational design with in-situ growth of functional materials and the unique structure, the Mn-Co-P/NF presents excellent electrocatalytic activities and stability with lower overpotentials of 63 mV and 310 mV to deliver 10 mA cm-2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 10 mA cm-2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Moreover, when directly used as a positive electrode and a negative electrode to form an electrocatalytic device to complete the overall water splitting, Mn Co-P/NF merely requires a small cell voltage of 1.70 V to obtain 20 mA cm-2. This work offers a controllable method to design and synthesize highly efficient and stable transition metal phosphide catalysts for overall water splitting and other catalytic fields.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000632419500001

As a new class of nanomaterials with a high ratio of surface atoms and tunable composition and electronic structure, metal nanocluster (NCs) are promising candidates as catalysts. Herein, a novel catalyst using S,N-doped carbon matrix (NSCSs) is synthesized to efficiently stabilize high density and ultra-uniform ruthenium (Ru) nanoclusters (Ru@NSCSs) by small-molecule self-assembly pyrolysis approach. The obtained Ru@NSCSs catalyst exhibits outstanding HER activity in all pH conditions (especially with a low overpotential of 5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 m KOH) and excellent ORR performance (half-wave potential (E (1/2)) of 0.854 V in 0.1 m KOH). Based on the experimental investigations and theoretical calculations, it is discovered that the S-atom can modulate the electronic structure and optimization of redox states on the surficial sites of Ru NCs during the ORR process. This work provides a feasible strategy for understanding and regulating the metal-support interface of ultra-uniform nanoclusters catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2688-4046			WOS:000839309200001

Herein, CuO nanowires encapsulated by Ni and NiFe hydroxides (CuO@Ni/NiFe hydroxides) in-situ grown on the surface of Cu plate were fabricated via chemical oxidation-calcination process and room-temperature interfacial Galvanic reaction, which were applied to the efficient overall water splitting. Thanks to the improved specific surface area and the conductivity, the optimized core-shell CuO@Ni/NiFe hydroxides nanowire array exhibit impressive OER performance as well as HER activity in 1 M KOH which delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 230 mV for OER and 125 mV for HER. Significantly, core-shell CuO@Ni/NiFe hydroxides used as bifunctional catalysts for an overall water splitting can achieve a low onset potential of similar to 1.50 V and a relatively high specific current density of 40 mA cm(-2) at similar to 1.73 V. This feasible strategy provides an accumulative opportunity for fabricating low-cost, effective bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the interfacial chemistry between atomic catalysts and hydroxyl groups had a profound influence on the electrochemical reaction process. In this work, we carried out systematic density functional theory (DFT) studies on the electrocatalytic process of the OER and ORR under alkaline conditions over hydroxyl group modified single metal atom (M = Ni, Co, Fe) and bi-metal atoms (denoted as MM and (MM2)-M-1, where M, M-1 and M-2 are Ni, Co, and Fe, respectively) supported on defective graphene (DG). We investigated the reaction processes of both the OER and ORR on bare and hydroxyl group modified catalysts, and the results indicated that the hydroxylated single and bi-metal (HO-M/DG, M = Co, Fe; (HO)(2)-MM/DG, M is Ni, Co, and Fe; (HO)(2)-(MM2)-M-1/DG, where M-1 and M-1 are Ni, Co, and Fe) atoms have much higher catalytic activity for both the OER and ORR than the bare metal atoms, while the HO-Ni/DG cannot be an OER and ORR catalyst because the intermediates (OH*, O* and OOH*) could not be adsorbed stably on hydroxylated Ni/DG under the reaction conditions. With the hydroxyl group modification, the single metal atomic catalysts (M = Co and Fe) exhibited much improved activity for the OER process, while the hydroxyl group modified bi-metal atomic catalysts exhibited much improved activity toward the ORR. The reason for the promoting effect on catalytic activities of hydroxylated atomic catalysts for the ORR and OER is discussed. We hope this work provides a new perspective on catalyst design for the OER and ORR processes.									67	6	0	0	3	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000494830400045

FEBS letters											10.1002/1873-3468.14527				2022-Oct-30	2022	Ever since the discovery that Mn was required for oxygen evolution in plants by Pirson in 1937 and the period-four oscillation in flash-induced oxygen evolution by Joliot and Kok in the 1970s, understanding of this process has advanced enormously using state-of-the-art methods. The most recent in this series of innovative techniques was the introduction of X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) a decade ago, which led to another quantum leap in the understanding in this field, by enabling operando X-ray structural and X-ray spectroscopy studies at room temperature. This review summarizes the current understanding of the structure of Photosystem II (PS II) and its catalytic center, the Mn4 CaO5 complex, in the intermediate Si (i=0-4)-states of the Kok cycle, as obtained using XFELs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1873-3468		MEDLINE:36310373	36310373

The effect of Mn content on the physical and electrochemical characteristics of these electrodes was revealed. The results show that the coated IrO2-Ta2O5-MnOx layer has a larger specific surface area due to its bumpy and porous structure. The doping of a small amount of Mn inhibits the crystallization of the active ingredient IrO2 and turns it into Ir3+. With properly replacing Ir with Mn, the electrocatalytic performance of the IrO2-Ta2O5MnO x electrodes can be enhanced dramatically. The increased electrocatalytic activity, longer lifetime and lower cost benefit from the larger active surface area of the Mn-doped electrode, thus promoting the release of oxygen in the sulfuric acid solution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1002-185X			WOS:000864195300013

Herein, a strategy is demonstrated to construct a 3D hierarchical oxygenated cobalt molybdenum selenide (O-Co1-xMoxSe2) series with attractive nanoarchitectures, which are fabricated by a simple and cost-effective hydrothermal process followed by an exclusive ion-exchange process. Owing to its highly electroactive sites with numerous nanoporous networks and plentiful oxygen vacancies, the optimal O-Co0.5Mo0.5Se2 could catalyze the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction effectively with a low overpotential of approximate to 102 and 189 mV, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and exceptional durability. Most importantly, the O-Co0.5Mo0.5Se2||O-Co0.5Mo0.5Se2 water splitting device only entails a voltage of approximate to 1.53 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is much better than benchmark Pt/C||RuO2 (approximate to 1.56 V). Furthermore, O-Co0.5Mo0.5Se2 air cathode-based zinc-air batteries exhibit an excellent power density of 120.28 mW cm(-2) and exceptional cycling stability for 60 h, superior to those of state-of-art Pt/C+RuO2 pair-based zinc-air batteries. The present study provides a strategy to design hierarchical 3D oxygenated bimetallic selenide-based multifunctional catalysts for energy conversion and storage systems.									27	1	0	0	1	0	28			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000527305000001	32311236

The La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 catalysts are modified with silver content that vary from 0.3 to 30 wt.% without damaging their microstructure. The electrochemical behavior of La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 catalysts with different silver loadings is studied on classical bilayer gas diffusion electrodes. The electrocatalytic properties of these composites are evaluated by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in alkaline electrolyte. The silver loading is found to have a significant impact on the electrode performances, which facilitate or block the electrochemical processes of the gas diffusion electrodes. The binary catalyst electrodes exhibit higher electrocatalytic activities than that of the electrodes with only La0.6Ca0.4CoO3 as the catalyst.

This material has hierarchical porosity, facilitating the mass transfer within the electrode. The nitrogen-doped carbon forms contiguous 3D network, connecting the isolated MnOx nanoparticles and ensuring superior electrical conductivity. Importantly, the MnOx particles contain manganese of mixed oxidation states; aligned with the nitrogen-doped carbon, this hybrid is among the best non-noble-metal ORR/OER catalysts in alkaline media, outperforming even Pt and RuO2 catalysts.									53	4	0	0	2	0	54			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000403572700009

All these different corrosion reactions can be inhibited with addition of the chelating agent 2-hydroxy benzoic acid (2-HBA). So, 2-HBA works in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere as well as in an oxidizing oxygen atmosphere. In contrast. the chelating I-mercapto benzoic acid only inhibited the hydrogen evolution of zinc pigment. which can be explained with "Pearson's principle of hard and soft acids acid bases". The non-chelating 4-hydroxy benzoic acid only inhibited the oxygen absorption of copper and brass pigments. So. For aluminium pigment chelation seems to be a basic requirement for corrosion inhibition whereas for copper and brass pigments chelation is not essential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Herein, a dual metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) pyrolysis strategy is developed to regulate the intrinsic activity and porous structure of the derived catalysts, where a Fe2Ni_MIL-88@ZnCo_zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), with a hierarchically porous structure, multifunctional components, and an integrated architecture, acts as an ideal precursor to obtain multimetal based porous nanorod (FeNiCo@NC-P). Benefitting from the synergetic effect of the multimetal components, facilitated reactant accessibility, and the well-retained integrated structure, the resultant FeNiCo@NC-P catalyst exhibits an oxygen reduction reaction half-wave potential of 0.84 V as well as an oxygen evolution reaction potential of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the practical application of FeNiCo@NC-P in the zinc-air battery displays a low voltage gap and long-term durability (over 130 h at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)), which outperforms the commercial noble metal benchmarks. This work not only affords a competitive bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst for zinc-air batteries but also paves a new way to design and fabricate MOF-derived materials with tunable catalytic properties.									69	6	0	0	2	0	70			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000503485100001

Herein, we present the development of a heteroatom B-doping approach, namely, B-doped Ni (B-Ni), for multifunctional electrocatalysis. The B-Ni catalysts exhibited multifunctional activities in an alkaline solution, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The B-Ni catalysts, as both the cathode and the anode, showed outstanding water splitting performance with cell voltages of 1.62 and 1.74 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the B-Ni catalysts produced an HOR current density of 0.85 mA cm(-2) at 0.1 V versus RHE. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the doped B atom can extract electrons from its adjacent Ni site, resulting in increased charge densities on the B site and a loss of charge densities on the surrounding Ni atoms. Such charge redistribution is favorable to the HOR and HER processes. The heteroatom-doping approach of the B-Ni catalyst provides an alternative strategy for the development of earth-abundant electrocatalysts in both energy storage and conversion.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800011

In this study as the first step of optimization, the condition of electrodeposition bath containing the ratio of Se/Ni, pH, and temperature was optimized. The response surface methodology (RSM) in central composite design (CCD) was used for experiments based on the parameters of the ratio of Se/Ni and pH. The prediction model after carrying out the analyses of variance (ANOVA) on the responses showed the best desirable values for the ratio of Se/Ni and pH were 0.7 and 3.6. The nanostructure NieSe electrode electrodeposited in the optimal condition requires 103 and 249 mV (vs. RHE) for delivering 10 mA/cm(2) in HER and OER, respectively. To temperature survey, the optimized NieSe electrode was synthesized at 25, 40, and 60 degrees C. Results showed that the electrode electrodeposited at the ambient temperature with large electrochemically active surface area of 8960 and low Tafel slopes of 86 and 35 mV/dec has the superior electrocatalytic performance for HER and OER, respectively.

The role of photoholes is to deplete this anti-bonding state once it emerges into the band gap. The reaction barrier is thus determined by the onset where photoholes enter the reaction. This process represents a new reaction mechanism, termed nucleus-coupled electron transfer (NCET), where electron transfer is enabled by the movement of nuclei that promotes the reactive orbital to become the frontier orbital. The NCET mechanism for the OER is shown to exhibit an overall kinetic barrier surmountable at room temperature.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000356874000016	26050615

In recent years, 2D MXene, a rapidly rising star in the field of material science, opens up new avenues for designing highly-active and long-life electrode materials due to its unprecedented physicochemical characteristics, such as large surface area, metallic conductivity, high electrochemical stability, good hydrophilic properties, and tunable surface chemistries. Considering the expeditious and exciting progress on this topic achieved in the past few years, herein we systemically summarize the recent advances in the controllable fabrication of MXene-based nanoarchitectures via different synthetic methods and their applications as electrode materials for various energy generation and conversion applications, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and reduction, alcohol oxidation, nitrogen reduction as well as CO2 reduction reactions. In the end, the major challenges and opportunities for the future development of MXene-based nanoarchitectures are also discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we study the occurrence of low frequency inductive impedance loops and their evolution for the oxygen reduction reaction on Gd0.2Ce0.8O1.9 infiltrated La0.8Sr0.2MnO3 (GDC-LSM), GDC infiltrated Pt (GDC-Pt) and mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-8 (LSCF) cathodes under solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operation conditions. The incorporation of GDC nanoparticles (NPs) substantially enhances the electrochemical activity of ISM and Pt electrodes with the concomitant occurrence of an inductive impedance loop at low frequencies. However, the low frequency impedance loop disappears for the GDC-LSM with GDC NPs larger than 41 nm or after polarization at 200 mA cm(-2) for more than 60 min. In the case of LSCF electrode the low frequency inductive loop transfers to capacitive arc after polarization for 30 min. The occurrence of low frequency inductive loops is closely related to the electrode electrocatalytic activity and microstructure and is primarily determined by the ability of the electrode materials to supply atomic oxygen for the reaction at the interface. A mechanism of competitive atomic oxygen supply and dissociative oxygen adsorption and diffusion is proposed for the occurrence of the inductive loops at low frequencies for the 02 reduction reaction of SOFCs.

The electrodes were individually tested in a mild aqueous electrolyte (0.65 M K2SO4) in order to define the adequate balance of active material in the capacitor as well as the working voltage. The hybrid electrochemical capacitor was cycled between 0 and 2.2 V for over 10,000 constant current charge/discharge cycles. A real energy density of 10 Wh/kg was reproducibly measured with a real power density reaching 3600 W/kg. The hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions on AC and MnO2 electrodes, respectively, were investigated in 0.65 M K2SO4. Despite the good electrochemical performance of the 2.2 V capacitor, gas evolution could be a hindrance for practical use. Subsequently, a 1.5 V capacitor was tested for more than 23,000 cycles and yielded interesting electrochemical performance with negligible gas evolution.

Despite tremendous research efforts, developing high-efficient, low-cost, and durable bifunctional oxygen catalysts remains a major challenge. We report a new class of hybrid material consisting of subnanometer thick amorphous cobalt hydroxide anchored on NCNT as a durable ORR/OER bifunctional catalyst. Although amorphous cobalt species-based catalysts are known as good OER catalysts, hybridizing with NCNT successfully enhanced ORR activity by promoting a 4e reduction pathway. Abundant charge carriers in amorphous cobalt hydroxide are found to trigger the superior OER activity with high current density and low Tafel slope as low as 36 mV/decade. A remarkably high OER turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.3 s(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV was obtained, one of the highest values reported so far. Moreover, the catalytic activity was maintained over 120 h of cycling. The unique subnanometer scale morphology of amorphous hydroxide cobalt species along with intimate cobalt species-NCNT interaction minimizes the deactivation of catalyst during prolonged repeated cycles.									67	3	0	0	2	0	67			1944-8244			WOS:000369044100004	26766495

It reveals that the presence of Pt leads to an enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction. In comparison to the single metal depositions, an additional current and an anomalous mass increase are observed when depositing from the complete electrolyte. The corresponding films exhibit a high O content and a needle-like morphology. These characteristics are altered by nitrogen gas stirring. Fe hydroxide formation due to a pH rise at the cathode and underpotential deposition of Fe deposition due to Fe-Pt alloy formation are discussed to interpret the results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although perovskites have been investigated for several decades as electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), only recently improvements in the ORR activity have been reported, when perovskites are combined with various carbons. This contribution shows the enhancement in the ORR activity when Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta is coupled with acid treated carbon black. Different mechanisms can account for the improved ORR activity of the composite cathode compared to the single catalyst.

Herein, we demonstrate the bifunctional activity of CeO2 nanospheres embedded in NiO nanoflakes. The CeO2/NiO nanocomposites are synthesized solvothermally by varying their molar ratios. Among the synthesized nanocomposites, CeO2/NiO-2 exhibits an outstanding OER/ORR activity compared to those of individual counterparts and other compositions and outperforms the benchmark ORR catalyst Pt/C and the OER catalyst IrO2 in terms of stability. The CeO2/NiO-2 nanocomposite shows the low onset potential of 1.47 and 0.8 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for OER and ORR, respectively. Moreover, a low potential difference (i.e., Delta E) of 0.86 V between the potential for 10 mA cm(-2) OER current density and the ORR half-wave potential for CeO2/NiO-2 makes it an efficient bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst. The excellent bifunctional activity of the nanocomposite is ascribed to the electronic synergy between CeO2 and NiO, which leads to the formation of an increased number of oxygen vacancy defects as well as more accessible active sites at an optimum molar ratio of CeO2 and NiO. The unique morphology of CeO2 nanospheres embedded in NiO nanoflakes facilitates the exposure of surface-active sites with the bifunctional nature of the catalyst. The practical applicability of the CeO2/NiO-2 nanocomposite is demonstrated with a Zn-air battery, which delivers 1.41 V open-circuit voltage and 105.0 mW cm(-2) peak power density. It has long-term cycling stability for 22 h with negligible voltaic efficiency loss.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000820297700001

It was composed of two well mixed bi-metallic MOF phases, Fe-rich FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F) and Ni-rich FeNi(BDC)(F), each containing two molecularly well mixed metallic clusters, to give pronounced hierarchical synergistic effects toward overall water splitting, delivering current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2) at ultralow cell voltages of 1.58 and 1.90 V, respectively, outperforming the pairing of benchmark electrodes, Pt-C//IrO2. The stability of the electrodes was also excellent, experiencing only minor chronoamperometric decay after a continuous operation at 400 mA cm(-2) for 30 h. The success may be attributed to the MOF/substrate synergistic effects between the FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F) and the conductive macroporous nickel foam, the inter-molecular synergistic effects between the two constituent MOF phases, and the intra-molecular synergistic effects between the FeO6 and NiO6 clusters of the Fe-rich FeNi(BDC)(DMF,F).									66	7	0	0	6	0	68			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000056

Rational design of nanostructured metal oxides supported by carbon is urgently required to improve the electrochemical properties of Zn-air batteries. Here it is reported that 1D bimetal (Co,Mn) zeolite-imidazole-framework pyrolysis method is used for the low-cost and easy preparation of Co3O4, Mn3O4 nanoparticles and CNx active sites embedded in 1D carbon nanofibers (Co3O4/Mn3O4/CNx@CNFs). The optimized Co3O4/Mn3O4/CNx@CNFs reveals the excellent ORR performance with the diffusion current of -6.96 mA/cm2, along with excellent electrocatalytic activity towards OER (1.63 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2), which are better than that previously reported bifunctional catalysts dirved from Co, Mn bimetal-oxides. Besides, we assembled the Co3O4/Mn3O4/CNx@CNFs into the air electrode of the Zn-air battery (and flexible Zn-air battery), indicating that the maximum power density is 265 mW/cm2 (and 191 mW/cm2), the latter power density is better than previously reported MOF-derived bifuctional catalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the support of 1D highly conductive CNFs and the synergistic effect of active sites such as Co3O4, Mn3O4 and CNx.

However, several issues must be addressed for realizing the practical applications of LOBs. Among them, the evolution of singlet oxygen (1O2)-which undergoes vigorous reactions that compromise the stability of the system-is a key challenge. The high overpotential induced by low-conductivity lithium peroxide necessitates the use of a redox mediator (RM) to facilitate the charging process; however, RMs can also be degraded by 1O2, which limits their efficacy in the long term. Recently, it was revealed that certain RMs play a role in suppressing the generation of 1O2. In this review, the relationship between the RM and 1O2 is described. Based on recent understandings, clear insight into RM reactions toward 1O2 and possible future research directions will be provided. copy 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X			INSPEC:21235657

Notably, the recombination of metallic Ni on the surface of Ni(OH)(2) NTAs can optimize the surface electronic structure to induce the loading of the active ingredient Pt, and the interaction between the interfaces can adjust the d-band center of Pt to promote HER. In the heterostructure, Ni(OH)(2) can make up for the disadvantage of Pt splitting the HO-H bond in alkaline HER and promote the dissociation of water. As a result, the Pt@Ni-Ni(OH)(2) NTAs heterostructure catalyst achieves a lower overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and durability. The use of metal composites on the oxygen-philic surface can effectively induce the loading of Pt nanoparticles, providing a new idea for the preparation of high-efficiency hydrogen evolution catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000715357000001

IP' Among the different MoS2/perovskite combinations studied, MoS2/LaNiO3-delta (LNO) stands out as the most active material toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with a performance far beyond that of pristine and milled LNO and MoS2 alone in both alkaline and acidic electrolytes. It is likely that, in alkaline media, LNO works as a hydroxyl acceptor, reducing the charge transfer resistance during water disassociation. In contrast, in acidic solutions the electronic interaction occurring in the MoS2/LNO hybrid contributes to a higher proportion of terminal S-2(2-) and S2- ions, leading to an increased number of active sites. This contribution serves as the first report of a hybrid material combining the strength of MoS2 and perovskite oxides, opening up new opportunities to boost the HER activity of transition metal dichalcogenides.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2574-0962			WOS:000458706700074

The question remains as to whether a bifunctional catalyst, or a single catalyst site, will exhibit potentials converging to + 1.23 VRHE. Transition metal-based perovskites provide tunable catalysts where site substitution can influence both ORR and OER, however substitution in the pseudobinary phases results in an anti-correlation in ORR and OER activities. We reveal that LaxMnyNi1 yO3 d, compositions with lanthanum A-site sub-stoichiometry exhibit reversible activity correlating with the appearance of the Mn3+/ Mn4+ redox couple. The Mn3+/ Mn4+ couple is associated with Mn4+ co-existing with Mn3+ in the bulk, as La3+ is substituted by Ni2+ at the A-site to create a mixed valent system. We also show that a direct A-site substitution by the Ca2+ cation in LaxCa1 xMnyO3 d perovskites also results in the creation of Mn4+, the appearance of the Mn3+/ Mn4+ redox couple, and a concomitant reversible activity. These results highlight a general strategy of optimizing oxide electrocatalysts with reversible activity.									28	1	0	0	3	0	29			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000465940700005	31123571

Here, a reversible three-electron reaction is demonstrated utilizing topotactic phase transition between antifluorite and rocksalt in a cation-disordered antifluorite-type cubic Li6CoO4 cathode. This cubic phase is synthesized by a simple mechanochemical treatment of conventionally prepared tetragonal Li6CoO4. It displays a reversible capacity of 487 mAh g(-1), a high value because of a reversible three-electron reaction using Co2+/Co3+, Co3+/Co4+, and O-2(-)/O-22(-) redox, occurring without O-2 gas evolution. The mechanochemical treatment is assumed to reduce its lattice distortion by cation-disordering and facilitate a reversible topotactic phase transition between antifluorite and rocksalt structures via a dynamic cation pushing mechanism.									3	1	0	0	1	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000577111700026	32886483

Taking advantage of directed evolution, we analyzed the stepwise oxygen-insertion mechanism of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenases, and transformed tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase from Xanthomonas campestris into a monooxygenase for oxidative cyclization of tryptophans. It was revealed that residue F51 is vital in determining the product ratio of HPIC to N '-formylkynurenine. Our reactions and purification procedures use no organic solvents, resulting in an eco-friendly method to prepare HPICs for further applications.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000508331400001	31828916

The model considers the species transport in the anode channel and catalyst layer, the double-layer and pseudo capacitances, and the multiple species coverage on carbon and Pt which influences reaction kinetics. Model simulations and analysis have been performed focusing on the reaction kinetics including carbon corrosion rate, the contributions from double-layer and pseudo capacitances, and the effects of initial Pt state at anode and cathode, temperature, and anode O-2 diffusivity. It has been found that the remaining O-2 amount in the anode catalyst layer, rather than the H-2 front, is the key factor for cathode carbon corrosion rate. There exists a charge balance in anode oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) which is the driver for cathode carbon corrosion, cathode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), cathode carbon corrosion reaction (COR), and multiple capacitive currents. Among all capacitive currents, cathode pseudo capacitance contributes most to the protons for anode ORR. Enhancing cathode OER is preferred over cathode pseudo capacitance to reduce COR since the latter approach can increase cathode PtO coverage and Pt dissolution. Higher cathode initial bare Pt surface leads to less cathode carbon corrosion, whereas higher anode initial bare Pt surface enhances anode ORR rate as well as cathode carbon corrosion in the beginning but reduces both afterwards due to faster consumption of the remaining O-2. Both reduced temperature and anode O-2 diffusivity are shown to decrease the cathode carbon corrosion during start-up, the former being highly effective. (C) 2015 The Electrochemical Society.

Herein, we report the electrodeposition of Pt-decorated Ni(OH)(2)/CeO2 (PNC) hybrid as an efficient and robust bifunctional electrocatalyst. The graphite-supported PNC catalyst delivers superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities over the benchmark Pt/C and RuO2, respectively. For overall water electrolysis, the PNC hybrid only requires a cell voltage of 1.45V at 10mAcm(-2) and sustains over 85 h at 1000mAcm(-2). The remarkable HER/OER performances are attributed to the superhydrophilicity and multiple effects of PNC, in which Ni(OH)(2) and CeO2 accelerate HER on Pt due to promoted water dissociation and strong electronic interaction, while the electron-pulling Ce cations facilitate the generation of high-valence Ni OER-active species. These results suggest the promising application of PNC for H-2 production from water electrolysis.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17				2639-5274		WOS:000599096600001	33623913

Here, we develop a general framework for describing the coupled effects of temperature, pressure, and pH on various phenomena relevant to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involved in water splitting. These indude water evaporation, water autoionization, and oxygen dissolution. We also consider important variables such as species free energies, species activities, OER standard potentials (E-OER(0)), and rate constants. We apply our model to (Ni,Fe)OOH, a promising electrocatalyst, to study in detail OER thermodynamics and kinetics under realistic operating conditions. We show that an increase in temperature makes water oxidation thermodynamics more favorable with ES ER decreasing from 1.24 V at 10 degrees C to 1.18 V at 90 degrees C. Even this small reduction plays a significant role in accelerating OER kinetics beyond the conventional Arrhenius-type increase in the reaction rate with temperature. Using a recently developed microkinetic model, we show that a room- temperature OER current density of similar to 10 mA/cm(2) translates to similar to 997 mA/cm(2) at 90 degrees C at a fixed potential of 1.51 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). We infer that catalysts on which the room-temperature rate-determining step involves oxygen as a product are favorable for high-temperature operation. Notably, for optimal OER kinetics at elevated temperatures and fixed potentials versus the RHE, the electrolyzer must maintain a pH level less than the standard pH (corresponding to 1 M OH- concentration). Our model predicts an optimal alkali concentration as low as 0.15 mM at 90 degrees C, with implications for the design of environmentally benign processes. Moreover, we show that a pH of 14.0, often used at room temperature, is physically unachievable at high temperatures. We also demonstrate the mild effect of pressure on the OER potential, with the latter increasing from 1.18 Vat 1 bar to 1.21 Vat 100 bar, at a fixed temperature of 90 degrees C. We find the effect of pressure on OER kinetics at fixed potentials to be negligible and indicative of the benefits of maintaining high pressure to produce compressed oxygen (and hydrogen). Our work shows how electrochemical water splitting under operating conditions currently used industrially compares to the process under laboratory conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2155-5435			WOS:000697346200001

On clean Fe(110), the S-H bond in methanethiol breaks below 100 K, affording methylthiolate (CH3Sa) and H-a. Heating to 600 K results in C-S bond cleavage near 290 K, leading to the evolution of methane and dihydrogen, and a p(2 x 2) sulfur overlayer. On the oxygen-covered surface (theta(O) = 0.25 ML), adsorbed methylthiolate and hydroxyl are formed. The amount of irreversible thiol reaction is essentially the same on the O-covered and clean Fe(110) surfaces. The amount of irreversibly bound thiol is reduced by approximately half on the (2 x 2)-S overlayer (Bs = 0.25 ML). The C-S bond in methylthiolate is stabilized more by surface sulfur than by surface oxygen, based on the methane formation temperature shifts of +55 and +20 K, respectively. Oxygen coverages greater than 1 monolayer form an FeO thin film, weakening the interaction of methanethiol with the surface, further reducing the methane yield which now reacts above 400 K.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000079541000023

In this work, we report the fabrication of cobalt-iron selenide nanoparticles to form a heterostructured Co-Fe Selenide catalyst through a one-step hydrothermal process. The fabricated Co-Fe Selenide shows an improved performance toward HER in both acidic and alkaline electrolyte as compared to individual CoSe2 and FeSe2 catalysts. The HER activity of Co-Fe Selenide, at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, generates an overpotential of 129 and 142 mV, a Tafel slope of 47 and 46 mV dec-1 in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, respectively. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits an OER activity with an overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with a small Tafel slope (78 mV dec- 1) in alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, a symmetric water electrolysis cell assembled using Co-Fe Selenide on carbon cloth as both anode and cathode in alkaline electrolyte achieves a cell voltage of 1.68 V at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with strong stability for 9 h. This outcome renders Co-Fe Selenide as a low-cost material for efficient HER and OER activity and as a potential replacement to noble metal catalysts for overall water splitting devices.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000701732400002

Developing efficient, robust, low-cost, and earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is therefore of great importance. Herein, we report a novel method to prepare two-dimensional cobalt hydrogen phosphate (CoHPi) through chemical conversion of alpha-Co(OH)(2) precursor at room temperature. The CoHPi nanoflakes with the thickness of 3 nm contain HPO42- anions, which have been demonstrated to serve as a proton acceptor in proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) process of OER. Due to their ultrathin structure and the PCET merit of anions, the CoHPi nanoflakes show enhanced OER activity as well as excellent stability in prolonged OER operation. Through further mechanism study, the observed performances can be ascribed to enriched active sites, surface superhydrophilicity, and rapid electron/proton and mass transfers.									55	1	0	0	2	0	55			1944-8244			WOS:000426143900026	29368505

Herein, we report a novel double core-shell-structured CNH@PDA@NiMOF (CNH-D-NiMOF) composite based on the support of carbon nanohorns (CNHs) and the direction of polydopamine (PDA) on the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). It is found that this unique structure improves the electrocatalytic performance and stability of the composites. Furthermore, a controlled partial pyrolysis strategy was proposed to construct the Ni-based nanoparticleembedded N-doped CNHs. The partial pyrolysis method preserves the framework structure of MOFs for effective substrate diffusion while producing highly active nanoparticles. This leads to the result that the Ni-based nanoparticle-embedded N-doped CNHs possess higher stability and significantly improved electrocatalytic properties. Among these derivatives, the sample prepared at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 degrees C (named as CNH-D-NiMOF-400) outperforms most of the reported unprecious-metal catalysts. At current densities of 20 and 100 mA.cm(-)(2), the overpotentials of CNH-D-NiMOF-400 are 270 and 340 mV for the OER on a carbon fiber paper (CFP), respectively. The outstanding electrocatalytic properties above suggest that this composite is an excellent candidate for the substitution of noble metal-based catalysts for OER.									20	3	0	0	0	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526543400037	32096977

Herein, we report an ammonium nitrate (AN)-assisted synthetic strategy to prepare Co, Co2P@CoP nanoparticles embedded in biomass-derived porous carbons as bifunctional electrodes for water splitting. The use of AN is not only activating biomass to porous carbons, but also reducing the synthetic temperature significantly. The synergistic effects of the Co2P@CoP heterostructure could lead to a low adsorption energy of hydrogen (Delta G(H*)) and conduction band bending, together with the N/S-codoped porous carbons could provide large specific surface area and desirable electron-donating feature, contribute to the remarkable performance with overpotentials of 0.129 and 0.212 V for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 mol L(-1)H(2)SO(4)and 1 mol L-1KOH, and 0.328 V for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 mol L-1KOH, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, the Co2P@CoP/PC catalysts enable overall water splitting with a small cell voltage of 1.63 V to achieve 10 mA cm(-2)and exhibit long-term durability over 1000 min.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2365-6549			WOS:000545756700005

The absorption and the yield by metal-free pristine g-C3N4 are, however, still limited with hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) mostly around ultraviolet-light. Here, we propose the graphene-decorated g-C3N4 as a metal-free photocatalyst under visible-light, based on our atomic-scale measurements and calculations. The g-C3N4 nanosheets on highly-oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) exhibit band-gaps appropriate for visible-light absorption and work-functions tuned for band alignments to supply electrons and holes for HER/OER. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) measurements for local density of states (LDOS) in atomic scale and work-functions in nanometer scale with ab initio calculations confirmed the various electronic transitions for each nitrogen and carbon atom in different atomic registries. The graphene-decorated g-C3N4, therefore, could provide a break through enabling the efficient water-splitting reactions under visible-light without precious metal.									13	3	0	0	1	0	13			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200054

Herein, we report an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) composed of ultrafine cobalt-doped iron sulfide/cobalt sulfide (Co:FeS2/CoS2) heterostructured nanowires (NWs), which were prepared by a facile hydrothermal route. In the HER, the Co:FeS2/CoS2 NWs achieved a low overpotential of 69 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 46 mV dec(-1). The overpotential shifted by about 3 mV over 1000 cycles along with a slight change in morphology of the Co:FeS2/CoS2 NWs. Density functional theory calculations and experimental results revealed that the charge transport kinetics of the FeS2/CoS2 heterostructure contributed substantially to the high performance of this HER electrocatalyst.

Herein, an ordered hexagonal-closed-packed (hcp)-Ru nanocrystal coated with a thin layer of N-doped carbon (hcp-Ru@NC) was fabricated through the thermal annealing of polydopamine (PDA)-coated Ru nanoparticle (RuNP@PDA). As an alternative to Pt/C catalyst, the hcp-Ru@NC nanocatalyst exhibited the small over potential of 27.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as long-term stability for HER in acid media. Interestingly, the HER performance of hcp-Ru is highly dependent on its crystallinity. The calculation from density functional theory (DFT) revealed that the difference in HER activity over various exposed surface causes the crystallinity-dependent property of hcp-Ru. The results provided clues to guide the design of Ru-based inexpensive HER electrocatalyst.									115	9	0	0	6	0	117			2155-5435			WOS:000438475100007

Samples were collected in the vicinity of the Bahamas Islands and eastern Caribbean Sea. Trichodesmium exhibited high rates of oxygen uptake in the dark and in the light compared with previously studied cyanobacteria. Oxygen uptake in the dark averaged 23% of the maximum gross oxygen evolution rate and was suppressed minimally at low irradiances or after the addition of cyanide. Oxygen uptake in light increased between 50 and 200 muEinst m-2 s-1 and was inhibited by 3-(3,4-)-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), indicating Mehler reaction activity. I estimate that 48% of the total photosynthetic linear electron flow went to oxygen reduction at moderate but nonsaturating irradiances. Light compensation points ranged from 50 to 300 muEinst m-2 S-1 with values highest for midday samples. Rapid oxygen cycling may contribute to the protection of nitrogenase by reducing the oxygen tension within the cell or colony during oxygenic photosynthesis and by providing a mechanism (pseudocyclic photophosphorylation) for generating excess ATP for nitrogen fixation.									103	2	0	0	87	0	105			0024-3590			WOS:A1993LA00800002

We report a fabrication of an efficient self-supported whole-carbon electrocatalyst for overall water splitting in a wide pH range, which consist of nitrogen-doped vertically aligned graphene arrays and nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (N-VG-CQDs) prepared from vinegar residue. N-VG-CQDs electrocatalyst displays excellent electrocatalytic performances towards hydrogen evolution reaction (overpotentials of 218 and 238 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively), as well as outstanding performances towards oxygen evolution reaction (overpotentials of 383 and 497 mV in 1.0 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively). In addition, N-VG-CQDs acts as a self-supporting bifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibiting good stabilities in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes and an excellent Faraday efficiency (about 83 %). This study sheds light on the usage of vinegar residue towards the development of cost-effective whole-carbon electrocatalysts in water splitting. And the study also facilitates the use of environmental pollutions to prepare electrocatalysts for water splitting and advances the development of the water splitting industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000868931100002

Herein, a 3D hierarchical heterostructure amorphous NiFe hydroxide electrodeposited on MnCo2O4 supported on Ni-Fe foam (NFF) electrode (denoted as NiFe-MnCo2O4/NFF) was successfully synthesized through a facile method for an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the strong synergetic coupling effect between NiFe nanoparticles and MnCo2O4 nanowires, the as-obtained NiFe-MnCo2O4/NFF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with a low overpotential of 272 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for the OER and a moderate overpotential of 98 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. When used as both a cathode and anode for overall water splitting in a two-electrode configuration (1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte), NiFe-MnCo2O4/NFF exhibits outstanding activity (an external voltage of 1.49 V to drive a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and impressive durability (no obvious degradation at a constant voltage up to 48 h). This interesting study provides a solid step towards enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of non-precious electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			1466-8033			WOS:000524748400012

Through successful design and fabrication of the discontinuously covered IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1) supported structure, we are able to combine the high activity of RuO2 and the outstanding stability of IrO2. Specifically, the overpotential of the IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1) catalyst at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 281 mV, and the turnover frequency (TOF) values of IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1), Ir3RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts are ca. 0.039, 0.023 and 0.017 s(-1) at 1.55 V, respectively, indicating that IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1) exhibits higher intrinsic activity and the active surface sites possess greater ability to generate oxygen. The excellent durability of the IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1) catalyst is confirmed with the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) positively shifting by only 16 mV after 3000 cycles through accelerated durability tests. Remarkably, the IrO2-RuO2@Ru (3 : 1) catalyst exhibits a huge advantage in reducing the use of precious metals in water electrolysis. Hence, the supported iridium-ruthenium bimetallic oxides show huge potential towards an active and stable application for the oxygen evolution reaction in acidic media.									86	5	0	0	3	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000408267300009

Here, we report the synthesis of Fe/Fe2O3 nanoparticles anchored on Fe-N-doped carbon nanosheets (Fe/Fe2O3@Fe-N-C) using shrimp shell-derived N-doped carbon nanodots as carbon and nitrogen sources in the presence of FeCl3 by a simple pyrolysis approach. Fe/Fe2O3@Fe-N-C obtained at a pyrolysis temperature of 1,000 degrees C (Fe/Fe2O3@Fe-N-C-1000) possessed a mesoporous structure and high surface area of 747.3 m(2).g(-1). As an electrocatalyst, Fe/Fe2O3@Fe-N-C-1000 exhibited bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for ORR and RuO2 for OER, respectively. The Zn-air battery test demonstrated that Fe/Fe2O3@Fe-N-C-1000 had a superior rechargeable performance and cycling stability as an air cathode material with an open circuit voltage of 1.47 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and a power density of 193 mW.cm(-2) at a current density of 220 mA.cm(-2). These performances were better than other commercial catalysts with an open circuit voltage of 1.36 V and a power density of 173 mW.cm(-2) at a current density of 220 mA.cm(-2) (a mixture of commercial Pt/C and RuO2 with a mass ratio of 1: 1 was used for the rechargeable Zn-air battery measurements). This work will be helpful to design and develop low-cost and abundant bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for future metal-air batteries.									93	14	0	0	8	0	98			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000378523300024

However, their development is impeded by the lack of robust bifunctional catalyst at the air-electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we report the controlled synthesis of NiFe2O4/FeNi2S4 heterostructured nanosheets (HNSs) that are highly efficient in catalyzing OER and ORR, therefore enabling neutral rechargeable ZABs. Associated with the formation of abundant oxide/sulfide interfaces over NiFe2O4/FeNi2S4 HNSs' surfaces, the catalyst's oxygen binding energy can be effectively tuned to enhance the OER and ORR activities, as revealed by the density functional theory calculations. In 0.2 M phosphate buffer solution, the optimized NiFe2O4/FeNi2S4 HNSs present an excellent oxygen electrocatalytic activity and stability, with much lower OER and ORR over- potentials than single-component FeNi2S4 or NiFe2O4 and with negligible performance decay in accelerated durability testing. When used as an air-electrode, the NiFe2O4/FeNi2S4 HNSs can deliver a power density of 44.4 mW cm(-2) and a superior cycling stability (only 0.6% decay after 900 cycles at 0.5 mA cm(-2)), making the resultant ZAB the most efficient and robust one with a neutral aqueous electrolyte reported to date. This work highlights the essential function of the heterostructure interface in oxygen electrocatalysis, opening a new avenue to advanced neutral metal-air batteries.									179	8	0	0	8	0	179			0002-7863			WOS:000454383400044	30403846

Meanwhile, the reasonable design of robust and cut-price bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is greatly desired for ZABs. Herein, a simple method to develop MOF (metal-organic framework)-derived hierarchical Fe,Co@N-C materials (FeCo-N-C-T), has been developed for effectively electrocatalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) based on ZnCo-ZIFs encapsulated with Fe-doped glucosamine (ZnCo-ZIF@Fe/glucosamine). Compared with commercial Pt/C and RuO2, the newly developed FeCo-N-C-700 exhibited superior electrocatalytic properties for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.896 V) and OER (overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and a reversible oxygen overpotential of 0.71 V. Simultaneously, it was demonstrated that the combination of Fe and Co showed synergistic improvements on the bifunctional activity. As a proof of concept, liquid- and solid-state Zn-air batteries (ZABs) were fabricated with FeCo-N-C-700 as air-cathodes. The developed liquid-ZABs exhibited an ultrahigh peak power density (150 mW cm(-2) at 240 mA cm(-2)) and robust cycling stability (no obvious decay after more than 360 Please change to-discharging cycles), outperforming those based on commercial Pt/C + RuO2. As expected, all-solid-state ZABs based on FeCo-N-C-700 exhibited excellent reversibility and durability. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) investigations revealed that FeCoN8 was more active than Fe/CoN4 for the ORR and OER, indicating the synergetic effect of the Fe and Co active sites in FeCo-N-C-700 affording superior electrocatalytic performance.									94	5	0	0	6	0	94			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536095500055

Ni3S2 has been considered a suitable electrocatalyst for either the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) owing to its good conductivity and stability, but high performance remains a challenge. Based on density functional theory calculations, we propose a practical 3d-transition-metal (TM = Mn, Fe and Co) doping to enhance the catalytic performance for both HER and OER on the Ni3S2 (101) facet. The enhancement originates from TM-doping-induced charge rearrangement and charge transfer, which increases the surface activity and promotes catalytic behavior. In particular, Mn-doped Ni3S2 shows good bifunctional catalytic activity because it possesses more active sites, reduced hydrogen adsorption free energy (Delta G(H*)) for HER and low overpotential for OER. Importantly, this work not only provides a feasible means to design efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water-splitting but also provides insights into the mechanism of improving catalytic behavior.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000858450400001	36320836

Central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to simulate and optimize the graphene compounds additive in the coating. The slope difference in the transpassive region at NaCl and H2SO4 solutions was considered as the significant factor for the selectivity of anode between the competitive evolution reactions of oxygen and chlorine. In order to characterize the coating, XRD, FTIR, FESEM, TEM, AFM tests, CV, polarization, and EIS curves were carried out. The obtained optimal condition included the GO concentration of 0.56mgml(-1), the rGO concentration of about 0.56mgml(-1), and the layers number of 4. It was predicted that the optimal selectivity of the graphene modified electrode is approximately 83.189, which was measured to be about 84.944 at the reproducible level. Indeed, the model for simulating the graphene modification was suitable and reliable.SA electrocatalyst coatings modified with GO/rGO nanosheets on the titanium substrate were synthesized by sol-gel method using the experimental design.Simulation and optimization of the amount of GO/rGO additives to the coating and number of applied coating layers on the selectivity property of anodic reactions of the DSA electrode were done by CCD and RSM method.The difference in slope of the transpassive region in NaCl + H2SO4 solutions was considered as the important factor in the selectivity of anode between competitive evolution reactions of chlorine and oxygen at the electrode surface, and the optimal DSA coating conditions including GO/rGO were obtained by the proposed model.TOF measurements and GC-MS analysis confirmed that the use of GO and rGO has improved the intrinsic electrocatalytic properties accompanied by an electrochemically active surface area of electrodes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000467551800010

Herein, two new kinds of Ni (POxN3-x)(2)/NPC and Co (POxN3-x)(2)/NPC (NPC: N, P-co-doped carbon) are synthesized through a facile post-treatment of nickel- or cobalt-phytic acid xerogel, followed by an annealing procedure under an argon and ammonia atmosphere at 800 degrees C. The as-prepared catalysts exhibit outstanding catalytic activities for both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions, which are comparable to those of Pt/C and IrO2. Furthermore, the primary zinc-air batteries assembled with Ni (POxN3-x)(2)/NPC and Co (POxN3-x)(2)/NPC as the cathodes show gravimetric energy densities of 894 and 836 W h kg(Zn)(-1), which are superior to that of Pt/C (793 W h kg(Zn)(-1)). In addition, the rechargeable zinc-air battery assembled with Ni (POxN3-x)(2)/NPC exhibits an excellent round-trip efficiency, which is shown by a slight increase in the sum of the overpotentials for discharge-charge cycling at a current density of 20 mA cm(-2), even after experiencing 33 h of testing. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on metaphosphate salts where oxygen is partially replaced by nitrogen as bifunctional oxygen electrode catalysts for zinc-air batteries. This work provides an easy, low-cost and scalable avenue to develop new kinds of catalyst for application in energy devices.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000443623800047	30105344

Herein, a novel heterostructured system is explored based on 2D non-vdW and conductive nanosheets. Notably, the interplanar growth of 2D non-vdW Co2N nanosheets is realized between graphene layers in the current collector of carbon fiber papers (CPs), generating an interlocking structure within CPs. The exposed surface of Co2N nanosheets possesses a high surface energy that anchors highly active CoNC, forming 2D CoNC@Co2N heterostructures outside CPs. This integrated electrocatalytic system bridged by non-vdW Co2N nanosheets presents a low overpotential of 1.52 V and an excellent stability of 280 h, which outperform most bifunctional and nonprecious-metal-based electrocatalysts in alkaline media, owing to the nature of 2D non-vdW nanosheets and the formation of strong and conductive connections among CoNC, nanosheets, and CPs.									19	3	0	0	0	0	21			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000575468700001

Results were obtained using membrane-electrode assemblies containing unsupported IrO2 catalyst at anode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon supported platinum nano-particles at the cathode for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Roughness factors of anodes and cathodes have been determined using an internal reference electrode. Individual cell voltage contributions have also been measured as a function of operating current density. Cell impedance spectra have been measured at different cell voltages along the polarization curve. It is shown that charge transfer processes are major cell impedance contributors at voltages up to 1.8-1.9 V. At higher cell voltages, cell impedances are mainly resistive. It is shown that the impedance associated with the HER is negligible and that the two time-constants observed on experimental impedance spectra can both be attributed to the OER. Possible mechanism options are discussed. Finally, some results related to the EIS characterization of PEM water electrolysis stacks are also reported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, a three-dimensional unified electrode in which nickel-iron oxyhydroxide (NiFeOOH) is directly electrodeposited on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) is developed as an AEMWE anode. Unlike conventional electrodes with a separate catalyst layer and GDL, the unified electrode comprises a single component integrating the catalyst layer with the GDL. The resulting unified electrode shows higher catalytic activity than a conventional electrode based on commercial NiFe and IrO2 and stable activity over 500 h. Investigation of the electrode parameters revealed an outstanding AEMWE performance of 3600 mA cm(-2) at 1.9 V, which is the highest among many AEMWE studies. The unified AEMWE also showed durable performance at an ultrahigh current density. Therefore, unified electrode design can be considered an alternative to conventional electrodes to reduce the hydrogen production cost.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2155-5435			WOS:000731608300001		
J	VUKOVIC, M								VOLTAMMETRY AND ANODIC STABILITY OF A HYDROUS OXIDE FILM ON A NICKEL ELECTRODE IN ALKALINE-SOLUTION								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY				24	9			878	882		10.1007/BF00348775				SEP 1994	1994	A hydrous oxide film on a nickel electrode was formed electrolytically by square-wave cycling in 1 mol dm-3 NaOH solution. The reproducibility of a second scan in a voltammetric experiment depended on holding the potential at a negative value (-1.1 V vs SCE) and on the positive potential limit. The hydrous oxide film, with a charge enhancement factor of 19, exhibited two stages of oxide reduction. Coulometric data showed that the majority of the oxide (80-90%) was reduced in Ni(III)/Ni(II) transition almost reversibly at potentials where the higher oxide was formed while, depending on the potential of formation, about 10-20% of the NiOOH was irreversibly reduced in the potential region of the hydrogen evolution reaction. An anodic stability test in the oxygen evolution reaction was carried out at 0.1 A cm-2. The hydrous oxide layer was stable over 14 days of electrolysis with an unchanged charge enhancement factor. The electrocatalytic activity of the electrode, however, expressed through the overpotential at the same current density, was not maintained.									111	2	0	0	6	2	112			0021-891X			WOS:A1994PG48900007

The growth process of these Ru nanoparticles, nanowires, and nanosheets follow non-directional growth, shape-directed nanoparticle attachment, and directional growth mechanisms, respectively. Kinetics studies approve that H-2 accelerates the reduction rate of the Ru precursor, while O-2 depresses the reduction. The calculation results of the Gibbs surface free energy under different gas coverage further show that small molecules' gas can effectively regulate the surface state and growth rate. These Ru nanocrystals exhibit excellent acidic water splitting performance. This work has systematically studied the influence of the small molecule gas on the formation process of the Ru nanocrystals, and provides an effective idea for the development and research of high-performance nanomaterials in the future.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000604278800001

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been investigated on those electrodes in 40 wt.% KOH after 30 min of preanodization under a current density of 1 A cm-2. The improvement of the electrocatalytic activity at 80-degrees-C with the nickel loading is due to the increase of the exchange current density with the amount of reducible species. The temperature of the electrolyte (40 wt.% KOH) strongly influences the electrocatalytic activity and the relative amount of accumulated reducible species formed during preanodization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0254-0584			WOS:A1993LB92900011

Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is a particularly promising method and is used in aqueous and nonaqueous studies of a variety of electrode reactions. Enhancement of the weak Raman signal is achieved by structuring the electrode surface or by use of SERS probes. This review article highlights the recent use of SERS to study several important electrode reactions: oxygen reduction and evolution, carbon monoxide oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction and the electrocatalytic oxidation of small organic molecules such as formic acid.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2451-9103			WOS:000495872600014

Among the current library of developed photocatalysts, organic conjugated polymers present unique advantages of sufficient light-absorption efficiency, excellent stability, tunable electronic properties, and economic applicability. As a class of rising photocatalysts, organic conjugated polymers offer high flexibility in tuning the framework of the backbone and porosity to fulfill the requirements for photocatalytic applications. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in visible-light-driven water splitting employing organic conjugated polymers. The recent development of the structural design principles of organic conjugated polymers (including linear, crosslinked, and supramolecular self-assembled polymers) toward efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and overall water splitting is described, thus providing a comprehensive reference for the field. Finally, current challenges and perspectives are also discussed.									172	13	0	0	12	0	173			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000537534000001	32483883

At basic pH, the reaction is at least seven times more efficient than in acid solution, where only hydroxyl radicals are formed. Evolution of carbon dioxide and loss of mass can be observed in basic solution. The role of certain functional groups was determined: alpha-carbonyls and phenols favour decomposition, and their reduction or derivatization leads to a decrease in the photodegradation efficiency. The presence of carboxylate groups and an increase in molecular weight lead to a decrease in the reaction efficiency. Evidence for the participation of singlet oxygen as a reactive species; in the reactions at alkaline pH, generated by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, is presented.									29	0	0	0	6	0	29			1010-6030			WOS:A1994NY38200007

Though the photoconductivity of eumelanin and its photochemical reactions with oxygen have been known for some time, eumelanins have not been regarded as photofaradaic materials. We find that eumelanin shows photocathodic behavior for both the oxygen reduction reaction and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Eumelanin films irradiated in aqueous solutions at pH 2 or 7 with simulated solar light photochemically reduce oxygen to hydrogen peroxide with accompanying oxidation of sacrificial oxalate, formate, or phenol. Autooxidation of the eumelanin competes with the oxidation of donors. Deposition of thin films on electrodes yields photoelectrodes with higher photocatalytic stability compared with the case of pure photocatalysis, implicating the successful extraction of positive charges from the eumelanin layer. These results open up new potential applications for eumelanin as a photocatalytically-active biomaterial, and inform the growing fundamental body of knowledge about the physical chemistry of eumelanins.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000444245600023

Overcoming this issue requires full understanding of global reactions and development of strategies in efficient catalyst design. Here we report an active copper nanocomposite, inspired by natural coordination environments of catalytic sites in an enzyme, which catalyzes oxygen reduction/evolution at potentials closely approaching standard potential. Such performances are related to the imperfect coordination configuration of the copper(II) active site whose electron density is tuned by neighbouring copper(0) and nitrogen ligands incorporated in graphene. The electron transfer number of oxygen reduction is estimated by monitoring the redox of hydrogen peroxide, which is determined by the overpotential and electrolyte pH. An in situ fluorescence spectroelectrochemistry reveals that hydroxyl radical is the common intermediate for the electrochemical conversion between oxygen and water.									96	9	0	0	7	0	96			2041-1723			WOS:000344060700003	25335848

ACS applied materials & interfaces				14	36			40761	40770		10.1021/acsami.2c06944				2022-Sep-14	2022	Developing earth-abundant low-cost bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is a key approach to realizing efficient energy storage and conversion. By exploring Co-based sodium battery materials, here we have unveiled nanostructured pyrophosphate Na2CoP2O7 polymorphs displaying efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic activity. While the orthorhombic polymorph (o-NCPy) has superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, the triclinic polymorph (t-NCPy) delivers better oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Simply by tuning the annealing condition, these pyrophosphate polymorphs can be easily prepared at temperatures as low as 500 °C. The electrocatalytic activity is rooted in the Co redox center with the (100) active surface and stable structural framework as per ab initio calculations. It marks the first case of phospho-anionic systems with both polymorphs showing stable bifunctional activity with low combined overpotential (ca. 0.7 V) comparable to that of reported state-of-the-art catalysts. These nanoscale cobalt pyrophosphates can be implemented in rechargeable zinc-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1944-8252		MEDLINE:36065996	36065996

However, the development of non-precious metals with high catalytic activity as the air electrode is still a big challenge. In this work, we realize the large-scale fabrication of single-crystal CoO nanorods with high active facets and abundant oxygen vacancies in-situ on conductive substrate, which exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity in both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The all-solid-state Zn-air batteries assembled with such free-standing CoO NRs show low charge/discharge overpotentials, a high energy density and a high cyclic stability. Our work indicates that the rational structure design of catalysts can pave a new route to next generation efficient and durable electrochemical devices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TEM images revealed uniform distribution of Pt and Ir nanoparticles on the TiO2 support. Histogram analysis showed particle sizes of Pt and Jr to be 4.5 and 2.0 nm, respectively, which was also confirmed by the XRD characterization. Among the various Pt-Ir compositions prepared, Pt85Ir15 (with a Pt/Ir weight ratio of 85/15) showed the highest catalyst efficiency towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The URFC testing results showed that the round-trip energy conversion efficiency (epsilon(RT)) of supported Pt-Ir/TiO2 (42%) was significantly higher than that of unsupported Pt Ir black (30%). The TiO2 support provided high surface area for uniform dispersion of the catalyst particles. The URFC performance increase was ascribed to the uniform dispersion and better utilization of noble metal catalysts.					10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)10th Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells Symposium (PEFC) Conducted Under the Auspices of the 218th Meeting of the Electrochemical-Society (ECS)	OCT, 2010OCT, 2010	Electrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K KElectrochem Soc (ECS); Energy Technol (ETD); Phys & Analyt Electrochem (PAED); Battery (BATT); Ind Electrochem & Electrochem Engn; Asahi Kasei E-Mat Corp; Ion Power Inc; UTC Power Corp; Umicore; Tokuyama Corp; Toyota Motor Eng & Mfg N Amer; Pine Res Instruments; Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K K	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1938-5862	1938-6737	978-1-56677-820-6	WOS:000313331100194

For the first time, the FeO inner scale on the steel with low Cr and Si contents is observed to incur a eutectoid reaction in a divorced mode during cooling, resulting into a bimodal Ni distribution near the scale/substrate interface. In contrast, a combination reaction of oxygen and FeO layer occurs on the steel with high Cr and Si contents where cracks in scales provide pathway for oxygen transport, and a fine-grained nanocomposite oxide band develops near the interface.

If exposed to humid Cl-2 gas for 110 min, steel S235 became an electrocatalyst that exhibits an overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of 462 mV at 1 mAcm(-2) at pH 7.

Potential versus time plots measured at a constant current demonstrate the sufficient stability of all samples under catalysis conditions at pH 7 and 13 for tens of hours. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectra could be reasonably resolved with the proviso that Fe2O3, FeO(OH), MnO(OH), and Mn2O3 are the predominant Fe and Mn species on the surface of the oxidized steel S235.									46	1	0	0	2	0	46			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000362729300014	26276387

Herein, 3D nickel-iron phosphides nanosheets modified by MnOx nanoparticles are grown on nickel foam (MnOx/NiFeP/NF). Resulting from the electronic coupling effect enabled by interface modifications, the intrinsic activities of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are improved. Meanwhile, 3D nanosheets provide abundant active sites for HER and OER, leading to accelerating the reaction kinetics. Besides, the shell-protection characteristic of MnOx improves the durability of MnOx/NiFeP/NF. Therefore, MnOx/NiFeP/NF shows exceptional bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward HER (an overpotential of 255 mV at 500 mA cm(-2)), OER (overpotentials of 296 and 346 mV at 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively), and overall water splitting (cell voltages of 1.796 and 1.828 V at 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively). Furthermore, it owns remarkably outstanding stability for overall water splitting at ultra-high current densities (120 and 70 h at 500 and 1000 mA cm(-2), respectively), which outperforms almost all of the non-noble metal electrocatalysts. This work presents efficient strategies of interface modifications, 3D nanostructures, and shell protection to afford ultra-high current densities.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000728992900001	34894072

However, efficient water splitting is hindered by the kinetically sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which requires significant energy inputs to drive the reaction at sufficiently fast rates. Recently, an increasing number of applications have emerged that require water electrolysis at neutral pH and under ambient conditions. This requirement creates additional challenges as the electrolysis of water is favorable in acidic and alkaline conditions. In order to tackle these challenges, considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of earth-abundant, highly effective, and robust electrocatalysts for the OER at pH = 7. Of these catalysts, amorphous transition-metal phosphates have attracted wide attention because of their unique electrocatalytic properties. In this paper, the OER performance of a series of amorphous first-row transition metal phosphate (TM-Pi) catalysts, namely Co-Pi, NiFe-Pi and Fe-Pi prepared with different deposition strategies onto various substrates, is comparatively studied in a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS). Additionally, a simplified cell model is applied to analyze the current-voltage characteristics and quantitatively evaluate and compare the reversible, ohmic, and activation overvoltage components of the studied TM-Pi. It is found that TM-Pi catalysts deposited onto a highly ordered nickel foam (NF) substrate are competitive with commercial Pt and IrO2 catalysts in terms of OER activity and long-term stability.

The rutile structure of VO2(R), showing metallic character, is a good candidate for a new electrocatalyst since it undergoes insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) from the insulating VO2(M1) at a low temperature of 68 degrees C, and involves a substantially increased electrical conductivity by three orders of magnitude. The extensive improvements in the electrocatalytic activity for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are confirmed when the IMT is induced where the overpotential (eta(10)) is reduced from 1056 mV to 598 mV in the OER and 411 mV to 136 mV in the HER, respectively. This improvement is attributed to the increased electrochemically active surface area (ECSA), reduced charge transfer resistance, and increased electron density, driven by the IMT to the metallic VO2(R) phase.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000797095500001	35583399

In this work, by means of comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) computations, we proposed a new class of OER catalyst, i.e., NiN3@MoS2, in which several TMN3 moieties were embedded into a MoS2 monolayer. Our results revealed that the introduction of N dopants can greatly enhance the binding strength between the TM atoms and MoS2 monolayer, thus endowing them with excellent stability, which was further verified by ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the dissolution potential, and diffusion barrier. In particular, according to the computed free energy changes, NiN3@MoS2 was revealed to exhibit the best catalytic OER activity due to its ultralow overpotential of 0.45 V. Interestingly, multiplelevel descriptors, including the energy descriptor (Delta G(O*) - Delta G(OH*)) and structure descriptor (phi), involving the local structural and chemical environment of the reaction site can well rationalize the origin of the high catalytic activity of NiN3@MoS2 for the OER. Our findings not only open a new avenue to design OER catalysts with high stability, superior activity, and low cost, but also offer promising descriptors to accelerate the screening of alternative OER catalysts to the well-established noble Ru/Ir-based catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2398-4902			WOS:000657769700001

However, their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance is not satisfactory, which limits their application for water splitting. Herein, a facile electrodeposition reduction strategy was applied to fabricate rich Se nanoparticles modified cobalt carbonate hydroxide nanoarrays on carbon cloth (Se NPs/CoCH NAs/CC) with 110 of 84.3 mV for HER, which is much smaller than that of original CoCH NAs/CC (110 = 347.7 mV). The superior performance of Se NPs/CoCH NAs/CC was due to its large active surface area, rich active sites, and synergistic effect between CoSe. DFT simulations also revealed that free energy for atomic hydrogen adsorption is much lower on Se NPs/ CoCH (0.75 eV) than on CoCH (1.36 eV). Moreover, this work offered a simple and efficient strategy for developing hierarchical selenium/hydroxides with outstanding HER performance, which contributed to the cost and energy savings for mass hydrogen production.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000681156600004

We report a stable homogeneous molecular copper complex, comprising of a labile diimine-dioxime ligand framework, that enables rapid and complete 4e(-)/4H(+) electrocatalysis for both oxygen reduction (2.1(+/- 0.01) x 10(5) s(-1)) and water oxidation (3.2(+/- 0.01) x 10(5) s(-1)) in aqueous solution presumably via in situ formation of binuclear intermediates. Computational investigations unravel the pivotal role of the interactive flexible ligand scaffold in accommodating the copper-core in variable oxidation states and influencing the O-O bond cleavage/formation dynamics during the catalysis.

Herein, we report nanocomposites of rock salt type nickel oxide and cobalt oxide supported on ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) as efficient non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline solution. The rock salt type NixCoyOx+y@OMC (x/y = 0:1,2:1,1:1,1:2,1:0) nanocomposites are synthesized through a nanocasting and carbon thermal reduction route by using the OMC as a nano-reactor. The OMC is used as the support material, with large specific surface area and pore volume, which can not only effectively disperse metal oxides nanoparticles and prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles, but also improve electrocatalytic performance of metal oxides by increasing electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic active sites. Interestingly, the rock salt type NiCo2O3@OMC exhibits the lowest overpotential of 281 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH, which is even lower than those values reported previously for RuO2 and IrO2 precious catalysts, and a small Tafel slope of 96.8 mV/dec for the OER. Notably, the NiCo2O3@OMC has a turnover frequency value of 0.0341 s(-1)and an actual oxygen generation rate of ca. 22.5 mu mol/h, much higher than its counterparts, confirming its outstanding intrinsic activity as an OER catalyst. Furthermore, the NiCo2O3@OMC has a good durability without obvious attenuation after continuous operation test for 230 h. Evidently, the NiCo2O3@OMC catalyst can remarkably promote the OER, and thus brighten the prospect of non-noble metal for efficient water electrolysis in industrial scale.									72	3	0	0	4	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000483451200062

The cell also allows for in situ XAS performed in fluorescence mode. Constant experimental conditions, even under moderate gas evolution, are provided by the electrolyte flow with controlled gas saturation. A special configuration of working and counter electrode, respectively, yields low residual ohmic resistance in three-electrode measurements that enables the study of thick porous electrodes of active high surface area materials. The cell proved its functionality and reliability in two studies: First, an in situ anomalous SAXS experiment for the high-potential degradation properties of a Pt/IrO2-TiO2 catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction at polymer electrolyte fuel cell cathodes; and second, an in situ XAS study of the electronic state of Ir centers inside an IrO2-TiO2 catalyst under oxygen evolution conditions.

Investigation of the deposition process and obtained films demonstrates typical for superoxide-assisted method mechanism of polymer formation, which leads to phenazine type bridges between porphyrin moieties. The density functional theory method has been used to model a polymer chain fragment and an analysis of natural bond orbital has been carried out. According to the calculations, the charge density distribution on the carbon skeleton of the obtained polymer resembles the distribution of charges on carbon materials doped with nitrogen, which are considered as promising catalysts for the oxygen electroreduction. Thus, the energy of adsorption of O-2 and OOH species (intermediates of oxygen electroreduction) on potential catalytic centers of the model polymer fragment has been calculated. The calculation results indicate predominantly two-electron pathway of O-2 reduction.

Perovskite oxides with in situ exsolved metal nanoparticles have emerged as promising candidates, while their activities are still unsatisfying and mechanisms unclear. Here we develop a novel hybrid catalyst with the in situ exsolved and phosphorized Co nanoparticles on Sr2FeMoO6 perovskite oxide surface based on density functional theory predictions, and use it as a model system to investigate the particle-substrate interactions with combined experimental studies and theoretical calculations. The as-prepared electrocatalyst exhibits boosted activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction and overall water-splitting in alkaline solution, comparable to these of precious-metal catalysts. Further studies reveal the phase transformation during catalysis and the strong interactions between the phosphorized Co nanoparticles and perovskite oxide substrate. The modulated band structure, redistributed charge density and spillover effect lead to the enhanced charge transfer, increased O covalency, optimized intermediate adsorption and reduced energy barrier, enhancing the overall activity synergistically.

All the curves of CO2 evolution during CO-O-2, cycles presented a bimodal shape. The first peak was primarily the result of the reaction of CO with the oxygen from the oxides, which was mainly determined by the nature of the material. The second peak was mostly related to the CO2 adsorption behavior and was highly influenced by the surface area and the number of surface active sites. As a result, OSC activity of the samples followed in the order of CZC > CCZ > ZCC approximate to CZP.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1002-0721			WOS:000249257100007

Herein, we successfully designed and prepared a series of silver-decorated CeO2(Ag/CeO2) photocatalysts with different morphologies by a facile hydrothermal route. The physical properties, charge transfer behavior and photocatalytic performances (degradation and hydrogen evolution) over diverse catalysts with nanocubes, nanoparticles and nanorods shapes were comprehensively studied. It was found that the Ag-decorated CeO2 nanorods (Ag/R-CeO2) demonstrate the best activity for both photocatalytic methyl orange (MO) degradation and photocatalytic H-2 production reaction with attractive stability during cycling tests, suggesting its desirable practical potential. The superior performance of Ag/R-CeO2 can be ascribed to (1) the facilitated light absorption due to enriched surface oxygen vacancies (OVs) and plasmonic Ag nanoparticles on nanorods, (2) the facilitated photo-excited charge carrier (e(-)-h(+)) separation efficiency on a metal/oxide hybrid structure and (3) the promoted formation of active reaction intermediates on surface-enriched Ag and oxygen vacancies reactive sites on Ag/CeO2 nanorods. This study provides a valuable discovery of the utilization of abundant solar energy for diverse catalytic processes.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2079-4991		WOS:000657018300001	33923342

Herein, we develop a unique metal-organic framework aided vanadium pentoxide nanorods (MOF-V2O5 NRs-500) that can be used as an OER electrocatalyst under alkaline solutions. The crystal structure, surface chemical state, and porosity of MOF-V2O5 NRs-500 can be altered by annealing in an oxygen atmosphere. The resultant MOF-V2O5 NRs-500 demonstrate high catalytic activity against OER in basic conditions, with a low overpotential of 300 mV at a derived current density of 50 mA cm = 2, and extraordinary durability of more than 50 h. Superior electrochemical performance might be attributed to the high exposure level of active sites emanating from porous MOF-V2O5 NRs-500. Furthermore, the porous MOF-V2O5 NRs-500 skeleton may provide homogenous mass transport channels as well as quick electron transfer.

In principle, water splitting under acidic conditions possesses many advantages, such as high ionic conductivity, few side reactions, high proton concentrations, low ohmic losses and compact system designs. However, under acidic conditions, only a limited range of electrocatalysts could survive, especially for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which needs a high potential. It remains a challenge to design and synthesize acidic OER electrocatalysts with high performance, which is intrinsically related to the electronic, surface and morphological structure of catalysts. Therefore, rational design of advanced OER catalysts is indispensable for superior performance. In this review, various design strategies for the development of desired catalysts with enhanced OER performance are comprehensively summarized, including defect engineering, structural manipulation, atomic arrangement tailoring, and interface regulation.

We propose in this work a "dual strategy" in which tuning the electronic properties of the oxide, such as La1-xSrxCoO3-delta, can be dissociated from the use of surface functionalization with phosphate ion groups (P-i) that enhances the interfacial proton transfer. Results show that the P-i functionalized La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta gives rise to a significant enhancement of the OER activity when compared to La0.5Sr0.5Co3-delta and LaCoO3. We further demonstrate that the P-i surface functionalization selectivity enhances the activity when the OER kinetics is limited by the proton transfer. Finally, this work suggests that tuning the catalytic activity by such a "dual approach" may be a new and largely unexplored avenue for the design of novel high-performance catalysts.									69	2	0	0	4	0	69			1948-7185			WOS:000407191300003	28686453

First, we calculated the reactivity of Fe2O3 with high-index facets [104] and low-index facets [001], as well as the deep reduction reaction mechanism of these two facets. Surface reaction results show that the activity of Fe2O3[104] for oxidizing CO is greater than that of Fe2O3[001]. Fe2O3[104] was reduced into iron oxide at lower oxidation state or into iron, which could then be regenerated after being oxidized by O-2. The deep reduction reaction mechanism between oxygen carrier and CO shows that Fe2O3[104] can be completely reduced into Fe, and Fe2O3[104] exhibits high oxygen transfer ability. However, Fe2O3[001] can only be reduced to a limited extent, with a high energy barrier preventing further reduction, while it also exhibits limited oxygen transfer capacity. Results of experiments further verify the high reactivity and stability of Fe2O3[104].									10	9	0	0	1	0	16			1000-6818			WOS:000354153800008

In the current study, the evolution of heavy components from cellulose is investigated. The effects of an inorganic potassium salt KCl on the heavy component evolution during steam reforming are firstly revealed in the homogeneous steam-volatile reforming process. The results suggest that heavy components were formed by polymerization reactions accompanied with dehydration and decarboxylation. Steam and alkali metal both promoted the cracking and secondary polymerization of heavy components. In the presence of steam and alkali metal, the percentage of molecules with low weight (<250 Da) and high weight (>500 Da) both improved. KCl significantly promoted the polymerization of oxygen-containing compounds, increasing the average oxygen number of the heavy components by 1.4 to 2.2 times depending on the reaction temperatures. Heavy phenols are also promoted in the presence of alkali metal below 700celcius.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000799810600002

Herein, the ultrathin porous nickel-cobalt phosphide nanosheets (NiCoP NS) are successfully synthesized by microwave-assisted technique and used as a robust bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting. The NiCoP NSs can show excellent catalytic activity with a low overpotential (eta(10)) of 105 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen evolution reaction and a small overpotential (eta(10)) of 240 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction. The water splitting device of NiCoP NSs can give lower cell voltage of 1.45 and 1.67 V at a current density of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2). The better electrochemical performance should be attributed to the synergetic effect of nickel and cobalt, porous morphology, and large surface area. These key factors boost the reactant's adsorption energy, number of exposed active sites, and produce different channels for charge transfer and reactant/electrolyte diffusion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000830220400001

Here, via delocalizing the electron population around the active sites of layered hydrotalcites, we significantly facilitate the electron donation from the active sites in Cr-doped Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2.25) and greatly reduce the charge transfer barrier by 1 order of magnitude for high OER activity. The Cr-doped Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2.25) hydrotalcite nanosheets could thus achieve a small overpotential of 235 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) with an excellent Tafel slope of similar to 39 mV/dec. The X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the incorporated Cr ions.are substituted for Fe sites in Ni0.75Fe0.25(OH)(2.25) and the strong overlap of d orbitals between Cr with unpaired d electrons and Fe ions promotes similar to 0.3 electron pi-donation from Ni2+ to neighboring Cr (Fe) ions, and then evidently decreases the adsorption free energy of a water molecule to -1.45 eV for efficient OER performance.									16	1	0	0	1	0	17			1932-7447			WOS:000413131700018

Here, an assembled 3D electrode is synthesized by a one-step solvothermal process using such an original OER electrocatalyst. During the solvothermal process, Ni ions released from Ni foam in acidic solution and Fe ions added exogenously act as metal centers and coordinate with terephthalic acid (TPA) organic molecules by robust coordinate bonds, and finally, NiFe-based metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in situ grown on Ni foam, i.e., MIL-53(FeNi)/NF, are prepared. This binder-free 3D electrode shows superior OER activity with high current density (50 mA cm(-2)) at an overpotential of 233 mV, a Tafel slope of 31.3 mV dec(-1), and excellent stability in alkaline aqueous solution (1 m KOH). It is discovered that introduction of Fe into MIL-53 structure increases electrochemically-active areas as well as reaction sites, accelerated electron transport capability, and modulated electronic structure to enhance catalytic performance. Besides, first principles calculations show that MIL-53(FeNi) is more favorable for foreign atoms' adsorption and has increased 3d orbital electron density boosting intrinsic activity. This work elucidates a promising electrode for electrocatalysts and enriches direct application of MOF materials.									318	23	0	0	11	0	319			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000445666000027

Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was used as capping agent. The effect of PVP concentration during synthesis was also studied which provides a local control over the morphology of CNP nanosheet to produce an ultrathin CNP nanosheet. Effect of PVP concentration in crystal growth and mechanism has been established. Cyclic voltammogram shows that oxygen evolution reaction (OER) onset potential for CNP nanosheet was found to be 1.45 V with a measured current density of 26 mA/cm(2). Linear sweep Voltammetry test has also been conducted to analyze the electrocatalytic OER performance. Anodic slope of Tafel plot establishes higher OER performance of CNP nanosheet than commercial RuO2. CNP nanosheets was found to be cheap and efficient eletrocatalyst for water splitting reaction. Voltammetric current density has also been expressed as a function of average thickness of nanosheets. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	SULEIMANOV, AS								SPECIAL KINETIC FEATURES OF CHLORIDE-ION DISCHARGE AT TITANIUM-RUTHENIUM ALLOY ANODES								SOVIET ELECTROCHEMISTRY				27	1			44	51						JAN 1991	1991	The kinetics of chloride ion discharge was studied at titanium-ruthenium alloy anodes as a function of ruthenium content of the alloy (between 0.5 and 25% by weight), the electrolysis atmosphere (Ar, O2, Cl2), the chloride ion concentration in the solution, the solution pH, and the electrolysis temperature. It was found that at the alloys, the same reactions take place as, under analogous conditions, at ORTA-type electrodes, viz., chlorine evolution and the formation of lower chlorine-oxygen compounds in chloride solutions, and oxygen evolution in solutions not containing chloride ions. The surface oxides at which the electrolysis processes take place and which are formed by anodic oxidation of the titanium-ruthenium alloys are extremely thin; still, similar values obtained for the slopes of the polarization curves, the reaction order with respect to chloride ions, the energy of activation at eta = const, and the dependence of the currents of chloride ion discharge at E = 1.36 V on the ruthenium concentration in the alloy reconfirm that anodically oxidized titanium-ruthenium alloys (at Ru concentrations of greater-than-or-equal-to 15% by weight) are a good model for ORTA-type electrodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-5387			WOS:A1991GF47400009

This paper described a facile ultrasonic approach for the synthesis of Ni-B alloy nanorods (Ni-B NRs). The crystallinity, chemical state, surface area and surface morphology of Ni-B NRs were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses, respectively. The electrocatalytic behavior of Ni-B NRs toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was studied by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Tafel polarization methods in 0.1 M aqueous KOH. The LSV results of Ni-B NRs showed very low OER onset potential of 1.44 V-RHE with an overpotential of 212 mV(RHE). The Ni-B NRs attained 10 mA/cm(2) of current density at a very low potential of 1.61 V-RHE than bare SS (1.87 V-RHE) and bare Pt (2.50 VRHE). Further, Ni-B NRs showed a low Tafel slope of 45 mVidec when compared to other standard materials, revealed the fast OER kinetics. The calculated specific capacitance of synthesized Ni-B NRs was 581 Fig, from the results of cyclic voltammetry at a scan rate of 2 mVis. The electrocatalytic and supercapacitor studies exposed that the synthesized Ni-B NRs can be used as an electrocatalyst for OER as well as pseudocapacitor for commercial electric vehicles.

Here, the development of amorphous nickel-cobalt-borate nanosheet arrays on macroporous nickel foam (NiCo-Bi/ NF) as a 3D catalyst electrode for high-performance water oxidation in near-neutral media is reported. To drive a current density of 10 mAcm(-2), the resulting NiCo-Bi/NF demands an overpotential of only 430 mV in 0.1m potassium borate (K-Bi, pH 9.2). Moreover, it also shows long-term electrochemical durability with maintenance of catalytic activity for 20 h, achieving a high turnover frequency of 0.21 s(-1) at an overpotential of 550 mV.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000405923800008	28589596

However, it is challenging to obtain active LaNbN2O because of the facile reduction of Nb5+ during the nitridation of the precursor materials. The present study attempted to synthesize a perovskite-type oxide La0.6Na0.4Zn0.4Nb0.6O3, containing equimolar amounts of La3+ and Nb5+ in addition to volatile Na+ and Zn2+, followed by the nitridation of this oxide to generate LaNbN2O. The obtained oxide was not the intended single-phase material but rather comprised a cuboid perovskite-type oxide similar to La0.5Na0.5Zn0.33Nb0.67O3 along with spherical LaNbO4 particles and other impurities. A brief nitridation was found to form a LaNbN2O-like shell structure having a light absorption onset of approximately 700 nm on the cuboid perovskite-type oxide particles. This LaNbN2O-based photocatalyst, when loaded with a CoOx cocatalyst, exhibited an apparent quantum yield of 1.7% at 420 nm during oxygen evolution reaction from an aqueous AgNO3 solution. This was more than double the values obtained from the nitridation products of LaNbO4 and LaKNaNbO5. The present work demonstrates a new approach to the design of precursor oxides that yield highly active LaNbN2O and suggests opportunities for developing efficient Nb-based perovskite oxynitride photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000653566600001

Among them, copper telluride could be a potential electrocatalyst but is rarely reported compared with other copper chalcogenides. In this work, rationally designed copper telluride nanosheet arrays on copper foil are fabricated via a facile ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazole chloride, [Bmim]Cl) assisted hydrothermal process. The ionic liquid serves as the solvent and etching agent, promoting the progress of reaction and affecting the morphology of products and the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The resulting layer-structure electrocatalysts provide a larger specific surface area and more exposed surface atoms as well as a tight interface with good adhesion to the substrate, thereby accelerating charge transfer and mass diffusion. Based on the above-mentioned advantages, the copper telluride electrode exhibits favorable catalytic OER activity and long-term stability in alkaline media. This work not only expands the variety of OER electrocatalysts but also provides a practicable approach to developing active and stable non-noble materials toward electrochemical water-splitting systems.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000580580000022

Herein, we design a facile and simple route to fabricate highly efficient 316L-type stainless steel-based electrocatalysts for water splitting by CH4 plasma. After CH4 plasma treatment, the amorphous carbon layer and the graphene encapsulated Fe3C nanoparticles are observed on the surface of stainless steel, which play the roles of active sites and protective layer for simultaneously providing an acceptable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The optimized stainless steel-based electrocatalyst exhibits an overpotential of only 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2 )and possesses outstanding kinetics (the Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1)) for OER in the 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution. We anticipate that the operating strategy of our system may aid the development of commercial non-precious productions as the efficient electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion.									71	6	0	0	3	0	72			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000463126200028

They can exhibit potential-induced phase transitions, potential-dependent electronic properties, variable oxidation and protonation states, and disordered local/surface phases. These properties make understanding the OER, and ultimately designing higher efficiency catalysts, challenging. We report a series of procedures and measurement techniques that we have adopted or developed to assess each of the above challenges in understanding materials for the OER. These include the targeted synthesis of hydrated oxyhydroxide phases, the assessment and elimination of electrolyte impurities, the use of a quartz crystal microbalance to monitor film loading and dissolution, and the use of an in situ conductivity measurement to understand the flow of electrons from the catalyst active sites to the conductive support electrode. We end with a recipe for the synthesis and characterization of a "standard" Ni(Fe)OxHy catalyst that can be performed in any laboratory with a basic electrochemical setup and used as a quantitative comparison to aid the development of new OER catalyst systems.									353	13	0	0	18	0	354			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000391898300012

XRD shows that the obtained NixSy is consisted of Ni3S2 and NiS in the three solvents. NixSy synthesized in ethanol has weaker peak intensities and more NiS planes, implying lower crystallinity and different electrocatalytic properties from the other two smaples. SEM images confirm regular morphology transform of NixSy/NF affected by different solvents. Nanorods and polyhedron structure of NixSy can be observed in water and ethanol, respectively. For mixture solvents, obvious transition morphology including some nanorods and polyhedron structures can be observed. Electrochemical measurements for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveal that NixSy/NF synthesized in ethanol has the earliest onset potential (1.24 V vs. RHE) and the largest current density, which may be derived from different crystal structure and morphology of NixSy. Therefore, the solvent dependent activity may provide a new way to prepare excellent electrocatalysts for OER.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1452-3981			WOS:000375393900044

A global shift to a sustainable energy landscape is, therefore, of utmost importance. Over the past few years, solar technologies have entered the energy market and have paved the way to replace fossil-based energy sources, in the long term. In particular, electrochemical solar-to-hydrogen technologies have attracted a lot of interest-not only in academia, but also in industry. Solar water splitting (artificial photosynthesis) is one of the most active areas in contemporary materials and catalysis research. The development of low-cost, efficient, and stable water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) remains crucial for artificial photosynthesis applications, because WOCs still represent a major economical and efficient bottleneck.

Herein, a new strategy for preparing a series of polymeric cobalt phthalocyanines containing S linkers (pCoPc-1) or SO2 linkers (pCoPc-2) and their tunable electrochemical properties are reported. The pCoPcs coated on various substrates show favorable electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). Particularly, the pCoPc-1 layer on Co3O4 nanosheet arrays exerts a cooperative effect enhancing both the OER and HER performances, and the subsequent phosphorization (P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC) significantly boosts the HER performance with enhanced hydrophilicity and conductivity. The high permeability and stability reinforcement of the pCoPc-1 layer allow the phosphorization of underlying Co3O4 to CoP without degradation, which remarkably enhances OER and HER performances as manifested by low overpotentials of 320 and 120 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. When engaged as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the overall water splitting, the P@pCoPc-1/Co3O4|CC requires a low cell voltage of 1.672 V at 10 mA cm(-2), showing long-term durability and mechanical robustness. This study demonstrates the collaborative catalytic role of polymeric macrocyclic compounds that offers versatile tunability and stability for various electrocatalytic reactions.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000674227200001

We report a reliable, scalable, and high-yield (>93 %) synthetic strategy to fabricate WS2 nanosheets, which exhibit highly desirable electrocatalytic properties toward both the alkaline sulfion (S2-) oxidation reaction (SOR) and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The findings prompted us to develop a hybrid alkali-acid electrochemical cell with the WS2 nanosheets as bifunctional electrode catalysts of alkaline anodic SOR and acidic cathodic HER. The proof-of-concept device holds promise for self-power or low-electricity electrolytic H-2 generation and environmentally friendly recycling of sulfion with enhanced electron utilization efficiency.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000685865000001	34288331

A two-step solvothermal synthetic approach was applied to fabricate four different novel heterostructures with tailored catalytic efficiency than the parent structure. The physicochemical and electrochemical analysis confirmed the successful formation of the heterostructure with robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline medium. The catalytic performance towards HER and OER depends on the electronic factor and growth mechanism of the heterostructure. The delta-MOMS exhibited improved HER performance with similar to 133 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density upon activation of the active sites of MoS2 through the heterostructure formation. Alternatively, alpha-MOMS offered the highest OER catalytic activity with similar to 250 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) current density. The higher percentage of the Mn3+ species with longer Mn-O bonds served as active sites in alpha-MOMS for OER. This approach helped in evaluating the selection of electrodes based on the above heterostructure for overall water splitting.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2398-4902			WOS:000620730300023

Herein, we fabricated a new 2D/2D heterojunction via directly electrodepositing of ternary Ni-Co-P nanosheets on graphdiyne (GDY) nanowalls. Benefiting from the synergistic interaction between Ni-Co-P and GDY, Ni-Co-P/GDY shows obviously improved activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), realizing a large current density of 300 mA/cm(2) for HER at low overpotential of 313 mV, much lower than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (430 mV), and a much better OER performance than the commercial RuO2. A small cell voltage of 1.60 V is sufficient to achieve the standard 10 mA/cm(2) current density by Ni-Co-P/GDY as a bifunctional electrode for water splitting in 1.0 M KOH solution. Raman, XPS and Surface valence band photoemission spectroscopic measurements confirm that the GDY-incorporation strategy optimizes the electronic structure of the Ni-Co-P and thus promotes its electrocatalytic activity.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000497857800001

This review summarizes process implementation aspects for the in vivo application of the especially versatile enzyme class of oxygenases, capable of specifically introducing oxygen from molecular oxygen into a large range of organic molecules. Critical issues such as reaching high enzyme activity and specificity, product degradation, cofactor recycling, reactant toxicity, and substrate and oxygen mass transfer can be overcome by biochemical process engineering and biocatalyst engineering. Both strategies provide a growing toolset to facilitate process implementation, optimization, and scale-up. Major advances were achieved via heterologous overexpression of oxygenase genes, directed evolution, metabolic engineering, and in situ product removal. Process examples from industry and academia show that the combined use of different concepts enables efficient oxygenase-based whole-cell catalysis of various commercially interesting reactions such as the biosynthesis of chiral compounds, the specific oxyfunctionalization of complex molecules, and also the synthesis of medium-priced chemicals. Better understanding of the cell metabolism and future developments in both biocatalyst and bioprocess engineering are expected to promote the implementation of many and various industrial biooxidation processes.

RGO-alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH has been successfully synthesized through one-pot hydrothermal-ionic liquid assisted route using tetrabutyl ammonium L-methioninate [TBA][L-Met] and graphene oxide (GO). The electrochemical studies were carried out to demonstrate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and photocatalytic activities. The overpotential reduction by rGO-alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH sample was higher than the nanobean alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH and pristine alpha-Fe2O3 samples. The photocurrent density enhanced for rGO-alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH urchin-like structure and obtained as 0.62 mA.cm(-2). The data evidences the idea that the beta-FeOOH layer in the modified morphology acts as an electron donor and the donor density increased substantially. Results from this study indicate that the rGO-alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH can improve OER performance significantly with a peak shift of 0.13 V in the potential window, revealing its excellent potential as a higher rate and lower energy needed candidate.									18	1	0	0	0	0	18			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000472243800001

Herein, we have coupled the early and later transition metals to form novel bimetallic tellurides electrocatalyst for overall water splitting by simple one-step hydrothermal. Because of the large specific surface area of g-C3N4 as substrates, the as-prepared NiTe-HfTe2/g-C3N4 displays appealing electrocatalytic activity and satisfactory stability in both oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline media. Furthermore, the electrolytic cell with two electrodes assembled by NiTe-HfTe2/g-C3N4 demonstrates the same excellent performance in overall water splitting. The strong electronegativity of Te and the synergistic effect between Ni and Hf together contribute to the overall water splitting process. This work provides a novel strategy for the design of bifunctional transition metal-based electrocatalyst to achieve efficient and stable overall water splitting. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, current studies greatly depend on empirical exploration and ignore the inherent relationship between electronic structure and catalytic activity, which impedes the rational design of high-efficiency OER catalysts. Herein, a series of bimetallic Ni-based metal-organic frameworks (Ni-M-MOFs, M = Fe, Co, Cu, Mn, and Zn) with well-defined morphology and active sites are selected as the ideal platform to explore the electronic-structure/catalytic-activity relationship. By integrating density-functional theory calculations and experimental measurements, a volcano-shaped relationship between electronic properties (d-band center and e(g) filling) and OER activity is demonstrated, in which the NiFe-MOF with the optimized energy level and electronic structure situated closer to the volcano summit. It delivers ultra-low overpotentials of 215 and 297 mV for 10 and 500 mA cm(-2), respectively. The identified electronic-structure/catalytic activity relationship is found to be universal for other Ni-based MOF catalysts (e.g., Ni-M-BDC-NH2, Ni-M-BTC, Ni-M-NDC, Ni-M-DOBDC, and Ni-M-PYDC). This work widens the applicability of d band center and e(g) filling descriptors to activity prediction of MOF-based electrocatalysts, providing an insightful perspective to design highly efficient OER catalysts.									28	2	0	0	0	0	30			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000661964000001

Herein, a novel strategy involving outer and inner structural engineering is developed for superior water splitting via in situ vertical growth of 2D amorphous FePO4 nanosheets on Ni foam (Am FePO4/NF). Careful experiments and density functional theory calculations show that the inner and outer structural engineering contributing to the synergistic effects of 2D morphology, amorphous structure, conductive substrate, and Ni-Fe mixed phosphate lead to superior electrocatalytic activity toward OER and HER. Furthermore, a two-electrode electrolyzer assembled using Am FePO4/NF as an electrocatalyst at both electrodes gives current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at potentials of 1.54 and 1.72 V, respectively, which is comparable to the best bifunctional electrocatalyst reported in the literature. The strategies, introduced in the present work, may open new opportunities for the rational design of other 3D transition-metal-based electrocatalyst through an outer and inner structural control to strengthen the electrocatalytic performance.									203	14	0	0	8	0	205			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000417490700024	29068533

Engineering them via tri- and tetra metallic LDHs have been crucially studied for expanding them as suitable electrocatalysts for OER. However, their poor electronic conductance towards HER still lacks in LDHs. Here, for the first time, we developed a new way by the addition of trimetallic Ru3+ and metallic Ru(0) to the NiV-LDH system that exhibits outstanding alkaline OER and acidic HER activities. To reach 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER and HER, Ru@NiV-LDH demands only 272 and 135 mV overpotential, respectively, with an ultra-low mass loading of just 0.1 mg cm(-2). In comparison to bare NiV-LDH with the same loading, Ru@NiV-LDH required a less overpotential value of 118 and 289 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER and HER, respectively. The successful formation of oxygen vacancy led to the confinement of Ru NPs, which leads to a low coagulation of the same and hence provides a greater number of active sites towards HER. We also claim our findings with the first principles density functional theory (DFT) approach for the successful addition of metallic Ru in vacancy sites. Moreover, it was observed that during Ru(0) addition to the LDH surface, an oxygen-rich vacancy surface is generated that enhances the OER and HER activities. It also revealed that the formation of oxygen vacancy stabilized the LDH surface when different Ru clusters are added by adsorption energy value of 3.8 +/- 0.5 eV. Further, the total density of state (TDOS) ensured a greater number of electronic states near the Fermi level for Ru@NiV-LDH that enhanced the electrochemical activity. Further, it also makes the catalyst a better candidate for the formation of active intermediate for OER, as can be seen from the calculated Delta G values for intermediate formation.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000744617600001

However, this remains challenging because most nonprecious metal based eLectrocataLysts suffer from strong corrosion in acid media. Herein, we crafted porous N, S-doped carbon network-immobilized uLtrafine pentlandites (i.e., Ni4Fe5S8) nanoparticLes (denoted P-NSC/ Ni4Fe5S8-1000) by employing rationally designed nanohybrids comprised of Liquid polymer-coated binary Prussian blue analogue (PBA) nanoparticLes (NPs) as precursors. Afterwards, the P-NSC/Ni4Fe5S81000 nanocomposites were exploited as OER eLectrocataLysts, with a small onset potentiaL of 1.53 V vs. RHE (1 mA cm(-2)) and strong stabiLity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, outperforming commerciaL RuO2 eLectrocataLysts. As revealed by both experimental results and DFT calculations, there is a synergy effect on the P-NSC/Ni4Fe5S8-1000 for OER: the pyridinic-N, S doped carbon could easily adsorb water, and then the highly active Fe sites of Ni4Fe5S8 NPs could catalyze the absorbed water to oxygen gas. Furthermore, the hierarchically porous nanostructure could promote multiphase transport during acid OER. Therefore, this work, for the first time, highlighted the great potentiaL of pentlandites NPs-based nanocomposites as efficient and stable eLectrocataLysts for acid OER.									36	5	0	0	1	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000455124900043

Herein, amorphous NiFe phosphides are electrodeposited on 3D nanoarraystructured nitrogen-doped carbon paper (NCP) for direct use as a hybrid electrode toward overall water splitting. The as-prepared NiFe-P/NCP electrode requires only an overpotential of 0.226 and 0.125 V at 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. In addition, NiFe-P/NCP electrodes are further measured as a catalytic cathode and anode couple (NiFe-P/NCPI INiFe-P/NCP) for overall water splitting, exhibiting a low cell voltage of 1.547 to reach 10 mA cm(-2) as well as a long-term durability.

J	Shang, Xiaonan; Chen, Weiheng; Jiang, Zhong-Jie; Song, Changsheng; Jiang, Zhongqing								In situ growth of SeOx films on the surface of Ni-Fe-selenide nanosheets as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction								MATERIALS ADVANCES				3	5			2546	2557		10.1039/d1ma01208h		JAN 2022		MAR 8 2022	2022	Reasonable design, extremely low-cost, high efficiency and high durability oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are essentially required to promote the practical large-scale applications of electrocatalytic water splitting for the efficient production of hydrogen. Herein, a rapid, facile, green and controllable electrochemical deposition method is reported for the growth of SeOx films on the surface of Ni-Fe-selenide nanosheets (SeOx/FeNixSe) through the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) cycle process, which are used as highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the OER. The obtained SeOx/FeNixSe heterojunction nanosheets have interconnected heterostructures, which play a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance by offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron transport. Detailed spectroscopic and DFT investigations disclose that the strong electron interaction between FeNixSe and SeOx could reduce the surface charge-transfer-resistance, and improve the electrocatalytic properties and the structural stability of the electrode. The optimized SeOx/FeNixSe (CM7-FeNixSe) catalyst exhibits superior OER activities to the commercial Ir and most of the reported Ni-based selenide catalysts with a small overpotential of 285 mV to achieve a current density of 200 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. This finding provides a new ultrathin oxide layer preparation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				2633-5409		WOS:000754763200001

The surface bound Cu(OH)(2) nanowires are in situ grown on a three-dimensional copper foam (CF) by anodic treatment, which are then converted to CuO nanowires by calcination in air. The direct growth of nanowires from the underlying conductive substrate can eliminate the use of any conductive agents and binders, which ensures good electrical contact between the electrocatalyst and the conductive substrate. The hierarchically nanostructured Cu-based electrode exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward OER in 1 M KOH solution. Phosphorization of the CuO/CF electrode generates the Cu3P/CF electrode, which can act as an excellent electrocatalyst for HER in 1 M KOH. An alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using CuO and Cu3P nanowires coated copper foams as anode and cathode, which can realize overall water splitting with a current density of 102 mA/cm(2) at an applied cell voltage of 2.2 V.									44	1	0	0	1	0	44			1932-7447			WOS:000416496200028

Here, we present a simple approach to prepare non-noble metal catalyst-Co3O4 nanocrystals (NCs). The particle size and shape were simply controlled by different types and concentrations of metal precursor. Furthermore, different sizes and shapes of Co3O4 NCs are explored as electrocatalysts for ORR, and it has been observed that particles with a similar shape, and smaller particle size led to greater catalytic current densities because of the greater surface area. For particles with a comparable size, the shape or crystalline structure governed the activity of the electrocatalytic reactions. Most importantly, the 9 nm-Co3O4 were demonstrated to act as low-cost catalysts for the ORR with a similar performance to that of Pt catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000423844700001	29319000

ZABs with pH-buffered near-neutral electrolytes have the potential for longer lifetime compared to traditional alkaline ZABs due to the slower absorption of carbonates at nonalkaline pH values. However, existing near-neutral electrolytes often contain halide salts, which are corrosive and threaten the precipitation of ZnO as the dominant discharge product. This paper presents a method for designing halide-free aqueous ZAB electrolytes using thermodynamic descriptors to computationally screen components. The dynamic performance of a ZAB with one possible halide-free aqueous electrolyte based on organic salts is simulated using an advanced method of continuum modeling, and the results are validated by experiments. X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy measurements of Zn electrodes show that ZnO is the dominant discharge product, and operando pH measurements confirm the stability of the electrolyte pH during cell cycling. Long-term full cell cycling tests are performed, and rotating ring disk electrode measurements elucidate the mechanism of oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. The analysis shows that aqueous electrolytes containing organic salts could be a promising field of research for zinc-based batteries, due to their Zn2+ chelating and pH buffering properties. The remaining challenges including the electrochemical stability of the electrolyte components are discussed.									26	1	0	0	1	0	26			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000510052700001

Unfortunately, the cost-inefficiency associated with energy loss (as overpotential) and costs of electrode materials have been forbidding this technology to surpass the currently dominant industrial process (steam reforming of hydrocarbons). With the recent evolution of transition metal chalcogenides, efficient commercial electrochemical water splitting is not too far. Transition metal chalcogenides are better in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) than pristine metals as they have negatively polarized chalcogenide anions with relatively lower free energy for proton adsorption. Moreover, chalcogenides are relatively easy to prepare and handle. Several metal chalcogenides have been reported with good HER activity among which Ni chalcogenides are reported to be exceptional ones. In recent years, growth of the nickel chalcogenide catalysed HER is massive. This review is devoted to bringing out a comprehensive understanding of what had happened in the recent past of this field with highlights on future prospects. In addition, we have also briefed the key physico-chemical properties of these materials and highlighted what one should anticipate while screening an electrocatalyst for electrochemical water splitting.									100	5	0	0	3	0	102			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200002

Herein, we report a straightforward heterojunction strategy to tune the OZER activity and selectivity of a Ni-Sb-SnO2 (NSS) anode, a state-of-the-art OZER electrocatalyst. The OZER overpotential (determined by scanning electrochemical microscopy) and current efficiency (CE) for NSS with metal (Ta, Ti, Si, Te, Bi, and Sb) oxide overlayers followed Sabatier's volcano relations with the potential of zero charge, which is an experimental descriptor for surface charge density. NSS/SiOx with an optimal SiOx loading occupied a position near the apex with 2.7-fold enhanced OZER CE (in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 10 mA cm(-2)) with retarded oxygen evolution, compared to unmodified NSS. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations elucidated partial charge transfer from Sn4+ to Si4+ and the overall hindrance of electron transfer to the OZER intermediates. Consequently, the reduced adsorption energies of O* and O-3*, together with the strengthened O-2* bonding, accounted for the improved OZER on NSS/SiOx.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000826605900001

Elaborate microscopy evidence discloses that hollow CoO nanocrystals (NCs) evolve from the channeled CoO NCs, which is an essential intermediate state to construct the hollow structure. Electrochemical measurements indicate that hollow CoO NCs exhibit three times higher specific capacitance than the solid CoO and show excellent cycling stability with the specific capacitance retaining more than 97% after 4500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g(-1). Meanwhile, as a catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen production from hydrolysis of sodium borohydride, the hollow and channeled CoO NCs exhibit much better performances than their solid counterparts. The hollow CoO NCs afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of merely 0.375 V and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV decade(-1), and they also possess more steady catalytic activity than the channeled CoO.									20	1	0	0	2	0	20				1466-8033		WOS:000384235800011

Therefore, the development of efficient and low cost electrocatalysts for the OER with high activity and stability is of great technological and scientific interest. We demonstrate here for the first time that maghemite (gamma-Fe2O3) nanoparticles decorated on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) function as low cost, highly active and durable OER electrocatalysts. The material generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 0.38 and 0.34 V in 0.1 and 1 M NaOH, respectively. These values are comparable to those of the best OER electrocatalysts reported so far. Moreover, gamma-Fe2O3/CNTs show a stable performance at a potential of similar to 1.64 V vs. RHE during 25 h stability tests. The gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles are formed from carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticles (CEINs) during the first OER measurements of the CEIN/CNT electrode. The CEIN/CNT material itself is synthesized by a fast and low cost floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition method in a one-step synthesis with a similar growth process to that of CNTs.									52	0	1	0	3	0	52			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000373119500027		
J	Falkowski, Joseph M.; Surendranath, Yogesh								Metal Chalcogenide Nanofilms: Platforms for Mechanistic Studies of Electrocatalysis								ACS CATALYSIS				5	6			3411	3416		10.1021/acscatal.5b00449				JUN 2015	2015	The systematic development of improved electrocatalysts requires strategies for preparing candidate materials as well-defined thin-film electrodes that are amenable to straightforward characterization of reaction mechanism and catalyst specific activity. While numerous thin film preparation methods are established for transition metals and metal alloys, few strategies exist for transition metal chalcogenides, despite growing recognition of their role as potent electrocatalysts. Herein we show that electrochemical atomic layer deposition (E-ALD) is a powerful tool for accessing well-defined metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts, by synthesizing, for the first time, crystalline conformal films of Co9S8, a promising earth-abundant oxygen reduction catalyst, with tunable nanoscale thickness. The as-prepared nanofilms display relatively high activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and provide a robust platform for detailed mechanistic investigations. Initial mechanistic studies reveal that oxygen reduction on Co9S8 nanofilms proceeds via rate-limiting one-electron transfer to O-2 with a specific activity of 20.6 mu A cm(-2) at 600 mV vs RHE.. This study opens the door to the systematic application of E-ALD to investigate chalcogenide electrocatalysts across the transition series.									31	2	0	0	3	0	32			2155-5435			WOS:000355964300028

Here we report a hydrogen production system that combines anodic and cathodic H-2 production from low-potential aldehyde oxidation and the hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively, at a low voltage of similar to 0.1V. Unlike conventional aldehyde electrooxidation, in which the hydrogen atom of the aldehyde group is oxidized into H2O at high potentials, the low-potential aldehyde oxidation enables the hydrogen atom to recombine into H-2 gas. The assembled electrolyser requires an electricity input of only similar to 0.35 kWh per m(3) of H-2, in contrast to the similar to 5 kWh per m(3) of H-2 required for conventional water electrolysis. This study provides a promising avenue for the safe, efficient and scalable production of high-purity hydrogen.									52	0	0	0	3	0	52			2520-1158			WOS:000733865600001

An aqueous rechargeable lithium battery (ARLB) was fabricated by using the above two intercalation compounds as the negative and positive electrodes.

IrNi@IrOx nanoparticles were synthesized from IrNi chi precursor alloys through selective surface Ni dealloying and controlled surface oxidation of Ir. Detailed depth-resolved insight into chemical structure, composition, morphology, and oxidation state was obtained using spectroscopic, diffraction, and scanning microscopic techniques (XANES, XRD, STEM-EDX, XPS), which confirmed our structural hypotheses at the outset. A 3-fold catalytic activity enhancement for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over IrO2 and RuO2 benchmark catalysts was observed for the core-shell catalysts on a noble metal mass basis. Also, the active site-based intrinsic turnover frequency (TOF) was greatly enhanced for the most active IrNi@IrOx catalyst. This study documents the successful use of synthetic dealloying for the preparation of metal-oxide hybrid core-shell catalysts. The concept is quite general, can be applied to other noble metal nanoparticles, and points out a path forward to nanostructured proton-exchange-electrolyzer electrodes with dramatically reduced noble metal content.									218	9	0	0	12	0	222			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000338652900005

Processed powders were then used to assembly thin film electrodes which worked as anodes in a three electrode cell to drive the oxygen evolution reaction from acid solution. Cyclic voltammetry and polarization experiments were carried out together with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to highlight the effects of milling on the catalytic performance. The findings suggest that the mechanical processing is capable of generating a considerable amount of lattice defects. The grain boundary extension as well as the content of structural disorder increase with the processing time. The increase in both the reactive site density and extent of structural disorder results in an enhanced chemical reactivity of the assembled electrodes.

Here we report, for the first time, a synthetic method that leads to in situ growth of {210} high-index faceted Ni3S2 nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (NF). We show that the resulting material, denoted Ni3S2/NF, can serve as a highly active, binder-free, bifunctional electro catalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ni3S2/NF is found to give similar to 100% Faradaic yield toward both HER and OER and to show remarkable catalytic stability (for >200 h). Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni3S2/NF's excellent catalytic activity is mainly due to the synergistic catalytic effects produced in it by its nanosheet arrays and exposed {210} high-index facets.									1304	80	0	0	45	1	1325			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000364727600006	26352297

Perovskite-based oxygen electrocatalysts have emerged as promising nonprecious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts, yet their catalytic activity and stability still remain to be improved. We report a high-performance oxygen electrocatalyst based on a triple perovskite, Nd1.5Ba1.5CoFeMnO9-delta (NBCFM), which shows superior activity and durability for oxygen electrode reactions to single and double perovskites. When hybridized with nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO), the resulting NBCFM/N-rGO catalyst shows further boosted bifunctional oxygen electrode activity (0.698 V), which surpasses that of Pt/C (0.801 V) and Ir/C (0.769 V) catalysts and which, among the perovskite-based electrocatalysts, is the best activity reported to date. The superior catalytic performances of NBCFM could be correlated to its oxygen defect rich structure, lower charge transfer resistance, and smaller hybridization strength between O 2p and Co 3d orbitals.									135	5	0	0	8	0	134			2375-2548			WOS:000443175500015	29951583

The optimal photocatalyst for water splitting should have high solar energy conversion efficiency and strong photocatalytic redox ability to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, few photocatalysts have been reported to fulfil these two contradictive requirements. Here, we demonstrated from first-principles calculations that the recently synthesized two-dimensional carbon nitride (C3N5) multilayers can serve as promising candidates to reach this goal. The intrinsic electric field which is more pronounced in the multilayers alters the band alignment of the photocatalysts, making the HER and OER be driven solely by the photogenerated carriers. The thickness-dependent electronic band gap (2.95-2.16 eV) along with the high carrier mobility broadens the energy range of light absorption and promotes carrier separation and transfer, leading to high solar energy conversion efficiency. Our computational results offer not only low-cost, Earth-abundant and environmentally friendly photocatalysts but also a promising strategy for the design of photocatalysts for highly efficient overall water splitting without using sacrificial reagents.									32	3	0	0	1	0	33			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000504106900026	31825061

Herein, we apply a facile method to fabricate cobalt nitride porous nanowires with a length of 7 mm and a diameter of 135 nm on carbon cloth (CC) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The self-supported cobalt nitride porous nanowire arrays exhibit superior catalytic activities with a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) at an overpotential of 97 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction and at an overpotential of 251 mV for oxygen evolution reaction. The alkaline water electrolyzer with the self-supported porous nanowire arrays as cathode and anode requires a cell voltage of 1.587 V to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2) and shows long-term stability at the high current density(similar to 360 mAcm(-2)) over 37 h, favorably comparable to the integrated performance of commercial Pt and IrO2.

While iridium oxide (IrO2) is considered one of the most efficient metal catalysts for the OER, the adsorption of the OER intermediates at the IrO2 surface is not optimal, the *OH intermediate being too strongly adsorbed. The substitution of iridium by another metal cation is then a common strategy to improve the catalytic activity. A combined computational and experimental approach was followed to elucidate the fundamental effect of nickel on the OER activity of (100) oriented IrO2. To achieve this, (100)-oriented Ir1-xNixO2 model surfaces were synthesized by pulsed laser deposition. Detailed structural and chemical characterizations were performed by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The composition of the film was varied between 0 and 15 at %, which is the solubility limit for the substitution of iridium by nickel atoms in (100)-oriented Ir1-xNixO2. All electrochemical characterizations were performed in an alkaline electrolyte, in which nickel dissolution is not observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The current density recorded at +1.6 V (vs RHE) was increased from 35 to 348 mu A cm(ox)(-2) between IrO2 to Ir0.85Ni0.15O2. Density functional theory calculations showed that the energy diagram of the OER intermediates was modified by the substitution of iridium with nickel atoms through a ligand effect. Also, it was found that iridium is the active site for low nickel content, whereas nickel is the most active site when its concentration reaches 15 at %.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000864606700001

The dispersion state of Co3O4 impacts the catalyst performances directly, while development of an efficient method for Co3O4 dispersion remains a pronounced challenge. In this study, it is the first time that the confined space strategy (CSS) is employed to make highly dispersive Co3O4 on the mesoporous silica (MS) SBA-15. The precursor of Co3O4 is successfully introduced into the confined space inherent in as-prepared SBA-15 (between the silica walls and the template). The CSS facilitates the formation of Co304 with extremely high dispersion after the decomposition of Co precursor. Up to 4 mmol of Co3O4 can be dispersed in per gram of MS without any X-ray diffraction lines (the obtained sample is denoted as 4CoAS), while obvious diffraction lines are detected in the counterpart prepared from calcined SBA-15 (the sample is denoted as 4CoCS). Further calculation indicates that the size of Co3O4 nanoparticles in 4CoCS is 9.8 nm, which is much larger than that in 4CoAS by using the CSS (below detection limits). Our results also show that high dispersion of Co3O4 corresponds to high activity in OER. The typical catalyst 4CoAS exhibits a potential of 0.73 Vat the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2). It is superior to that of 4CoCS (0.78 V) and of the reference catalyst 4Co(3)O(4)/CS (0.90 V) with the same Co content. Furthermore, the catalyst 4CoAS presents quite good stability in OER and is obviously better than 4CoCS.									23	0	0	0	3	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000456631800110

The Ni/NiFe_2O_4 composite coating was prepared through electro-deposition in Watt nickel plating by adding some NiFe_2O_4 powders. The optimized plating conditions for the composite electro-deposition were investigated by varying parameters,such as the plating solution pH and the cathode current density j_k. The composition and structure of the Ni/NiFe_2O_4 composite coating were characterized by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), energy X-ray diffraction(XRD) and dispersive spectrometer(EDS). The results show that the NiFe_2O_4 mass content in the Ni /NiFe_2O_4 composite coating is the highest(55. 15%) at optimized plating conditions of a solution pH = 5. 8 ~ 6. 0 and a cathodic current density j_k = 40 * 10~(-3)~ 60 * 10~(-3) A/cm~2.

Herein we reported a sacrificial template strategy for the preparation of borate anion doped Co3O4@ZIF-67 nanocages assembled with nanosheets (B-Co3O4@ZIF-67) by hydrothermal boronation of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). During the preparation process, two different kinds of borate anion sources were found to regulate the morphological structures by tuning the etching rate between ZIF precursors and the borate anion. Moreover, borate anion doping was also found to induce oxygen vacancy defects, which is beneficial for modulating the electronic structure and accelerating electron transport. Meanwhile, the resultant B-Co3O4@ZIF-67 nanocages possess a large specific surface area, which is beneficial for the mass transfer of the electrolyte and exposing more catalytic active sites.

Among numerous candidates, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated outstanding potential due to their exceptional structural advantages. This review summarizes a representative family of MOF materials, the carboxylate-based MOFs and derivatives as electrocatalysts for OER. With various carboxylate-metal coordinations, unique nanostructures can be constructed such as nanosheets, nanorods, polyhedrons, porous frameworks etc., making them suitable as pristine electrocatalysts or as precursors for carbon-composite catalysts. This review begins with a brief introduction on the structural advantages and synthetic approaches of carboxylate-based MOFs, followed by a discussion on recent advances of these materials in OER, where the effects of structural variation on the catalytic activity are emphasized. Furthermore, several types of the corresponding MOF derivatives are summarized. Finally, outlook on the development of carboxylate-based MOFs and derivatives for OER electrocatalysis is provided.

The as-synthesized CeO2-CuCoO/NF shows urchin-like morphology that is composed of numerous nanofibers, endowing the surface with superaerophobicity and massive active sites. Density functional theory calculation elucidates the crucial role of CeO2 in boosting the electron transfer and decreasing the free energy of intermediates during water splitting. As expected, CeO2-CuCoO/NF shows attractive bifunctional electrocatalytic activity with overpotentials of 266 and 93 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH, respectively, which are superior to most reported catalysts. A water-splitting electrolyzer consisted of CeO2-CuCoO/NF electrodes as both anode and cathode displays better performance than the noble-metal counterpart IrO2/NF||Pt/C/NF.

However, because the polarization curves of cathode and anode are different and vary with time, it is difficult to control the cell voltage and operation time so that the cathode and anode operate effectively under their respective optimum conditions at the same time. We investigated the evolution of coal during constant current electrolysis, where the reactions at the cathode and anode were simultaneously controlled by the circuit current. Constant current electrolysis was performed on coal-water slurries (CWS). The alkali-soluble matter separated from the CWS was subjected to constant current electrolysis and constant potential electrolysis. The results showed that constant current electrolysis was dominated by the oxidation of alkali-soluble matter, followed by the combination of alkali-soluble matter and residual coal, and finally the residual coal. The molar fraction of the aromatic bridgehead carbon in the residual coal increased from 0.132 to 0.214, which is close to that of the bicyclic structure of naphthalene (0.2). The aromatics in the alkali-soluble matter underwent a ring opening reaction, the degree of condensation decreased from 0.08 to 0.03, and the aliphatic chain length increased from 1.77 to 2.38. The results provide a reference for simultaneously controlling the cathodic and anodic reactions using circuit current and time.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000799871100001

In this study, we have demonstrated a simple, inexpensive, and economical approach to synthesize interconnected hierarchical porous carbon nanosheets (HPCNS) from renewable biomass for efficient OER applications. The synthesized HPCNS product exhibited high nitrogen content (5.02%), high surface area (up to 2954 m(2) g(-1)), and high conductivity (up to 11.03 S cm(-1)). The obtained HPCNS exhibited excellent OER performance with low overpotential (106 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH electrolyte compared to that of commercial RuO2, indicating outstanding charge transfer ability compared to the other two electrodes, HPCNS-600 (379 mV dec(-1)) and HPCNS-700 (208 mV dec(-1)). Among the different HPCNS samples, HPCNS-700 exhibited the lowest charge transfer resistance (R-ct) value (2.3 Omega); therefore, HPCNS-700 demonstrated the best OER activity. Furthermore, the prepared HPCNS samples exhibited high electrochemically active surface areas (ECSA) and double-layer capacitances (C-dl). The effective surface areas of HPCNS-600, HPCNS-700, and HPCNS-800 were observed to be 1.72 cm(-2) , 3.75 cm(-2 )and 1.87 cm(-2) , respectively. The HPCNS-700 electrode had the highest C-dl value (0.303 mF), which indicated more catalytically active sites for OER applications compared to the other two samples. Thus, herein we report a potential method for fabricating metal-free electrocatalysts for OER applications, which are comparable to state-of-the-art ruthenium-based benchmark commercial catalysts and other carbon-based materials. This remarkable performance of HPCNS electrocatalysts indicates great effectiveness for future applications. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, MnO2 and sulfurdoped MnO2 (S-MnO2) are prepared by a simple hydrothermal method. The results show that S-MnO2 exhibits a higher OER activity than MnO2 because the sulfur doping gives rise to more Mn3+ active sites, oxygen vacancies (VO) and electrochemically active surface areas. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further confirms that the abundant VO leads to a higher surface energy of S-MnO2, which is conducive to the adsorptions of H2O and OH- on Mn3+ sites. Moreover, formaldehyde oxidation reaction (FOR) is employed to substitute for sluggish OER to improve hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to OERbased electrolyzer (3.354 V), the cell voltage of FOR-based electrolyzer (2.778 V) at 100 mA cm-2 has decreased by 17.17 %, and the Faradic efficiency of hydrogen production increases from 89.6 % to 98.6 %. The results indicates that to produce the same amount of hydrogen, 17.17 % of electric energy can be economized. Thus the cost of hydrogen production decreases greatly. The HER efficiency is greatly improved because FOR has faster kinetics than OER. Meanwhile, after running for 2 h at 1.75 V, 52 % of formaldehyde has been degraded. The results demonstrate that the innovative electrolyzer can not only greatly improve the HER efficiency, but also efficiently degrade formaldehyde pollutants.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we innovatively report a facile and costeffective in situ synthesis strategy to prepare ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanosheets coupled onto hierarchical nano carbon networks consisting of carbon nanotube and graphene nanoribbon (NiFe-LDH/CNT@GNR) forming a porous interconnected nanocomposite. Partial unzipping of CNT induced by strong oxidation leads to the creation of GNR nanolayers tightly attached to the retained CNT framework, where GNR achieves high surface areas to load NiFe-LDH nanosheets and inner CNT still enables high conductivity. The CNT@GNR nanocarbon network not only enhances accessible electrochemical active area and mass transfer, but also provides high-efficiency conductive brackets with interlinked electron transfer pathways and achieve the strong interface coupling with NiFe-LDH nanosheets, synergistically resulting in rapid electrocatalytic kinetics. Moreover, NiFe-LDH nanosheets are tightly anchored on the surface of nanocarbon networks, greatly enhanced the stability of NiFe-LDH. NiFe-LDH/CNT@GNR exhibits remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1), and high stability for up to 17 h, superior to most LDH-based OER catalysts reported, and even better than commercial RuO2. Therefore, the facile synthesis and excellent hierarchical architecture endow NiFe-LDH/CNT@GNR nanocomposites as advanced electrocatalysts for outstanding OER performance. Most importantly, the design provides a simple but universal strategy to yield high performance of NiFe-LDH catalysts, facilitating the commercial process of non-noble catalysts for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000805649100001

Rational design and synthesis of desired electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance toward water electrolysis. Herein, by employing a tertiary amine triethanolamine with good chemical stability and slight alkalinity as the precipitant, we show a one-step route for the fabrication of hierarchical porous nitrogen-incorporated cobalt-iron (oxy)hydroxide (N-CoFe-OxHy) nanosheets with microporous, mesoporous, and macroporous structures in the catalyst. The as-obtained hierarchical porous N-CoFe-OxHy nanosheets possess a larger specific surface area, more active sites, faster charge transfer, and higher intrinsic activity than those prepared by using a conventional precipitant such as urea. The N-CoFe-OxHy catalyst exhibits a superior electrocatalytic OER performance with an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 41 mV/dec, and long-term durability. Besides, such a hierarchical porous N-CoFe-OxHy OER electrocatalyst was applied in a two-electrode electrochemical cell with Pt/C as the cathode to generate hydrogen and a solar-to-hydrogen system, demonstrating a low cell voltage of 1.53 V at 10 mA/cm(2), an outstanding stability, and the feasibility of developing non-noble-metal (oxy)hydroxide OER catalysts in practical hydrogen production via solar-driven unbiased water splitting. This work affords a facile strategy to modulate the morphology and activate the intrinsic active sites toward the rational design of earth-abundant, low-cost, and high-efficiency catalysts for clean and renewable energy production.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600021		
J	Ghanim, A.N.								Perspectives of electrochemical oxidation parameters in PRW treatment								International Journal of Environment and Waste Management				26	3			389	401						2020	2020	Electrochemical oxidation as an efficient route of advanced electrochemical oxidation process AEOP had been successfully applied for the treatment of real petroleum refinery wastewater (PRW). The electrochemical oxidation was performed using batch electrochemical reactor with carbon felt anode to be compared with beta-PbO2 anode. However, these anodic materials have higher oxygen evolution over potential and poor electrocatalysts for parasitic reactions with low cost. The experimental work considers a scope of operative and design parameters that influence the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of wastewater of a real national oil refinery effluent. Accordingly, a well-designed reactor accomplished to treat wastewater samples of 500-510 mg/L initial COD to study the effect of anode material, current density, and temperature on COD removal and oxidation kinetic. The results showed that the COD removal efficiency exhibits an exponential behaviour with the applied current density of more than 10 mA cm-2 indicating first-order reaction kinetics, and the reaction rate constant accurately estimated. Moreover, the impacts of pH and agitation speed on reaction rate constant were also studied.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1478-9876			INSPEC:21111193

For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the edge effects of carbon materials have rarely been studied in detail because of the complexity of various coexisting edge configurations and the controversy between carbon corrosion and carbon catalysis. Herein, the exact roles of common carbon active edge sites in the OER were interrogated using polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with designated configurations (zigzag and armchair) as model probe molecules, with a focus on structure-function relationships. Zigzag configurations of PAHs showed high activity for the OER while also showing a good stability at a reasonable potential. They show a TOF value of 0.276s(-1) in 0.1m KOH. The catalytic activity of carbon edge sites was further effectively regulated by extending the pi conjugation structure at a molecular level.									31	3	0	0	2	0	31			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474806700052	30985974

The corresponding thermodynamics and kinetics crucially determine the energy efficiency and power density of water electrolysis and fuel cells. Theoretical calculations based on quantum chemistry have been extensively used in catalyst design and mechanism studies of these reactions in the past more than ten years. In this perspective, the results and conclusions gained recently, mainly by us as well as others, for hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis through theoretical and computational studies are reviewed. We have particularly focused on the surface structures and coverage of the strongly adsorbed intermediates and their effects on the reaction pathway and kinetics. The results show that the adsorption properties of reaction intermediates not only affect the reaction pathways and activation barrier, but also impact the reaction kinetics of surface reactions by altering the structure and density of active sites. This indicates that simple calculation of adsorption energy, as doing in most of recent literatures, is inadequate to accurately predict the activity of catalysts locating near the top of volcano curves, e.g., Pt-based alloys, differently shaped Pt nanoparticles. The effects of coverage and structures of adsorbates should be taken into consideration. Based on such knowledge, micro-kinetic models are established to relate the reaction thermodynamics and kinetics with the surface structures, adsorption energy and coverage of intermediates, and electrode potential. Meanwhile, by utilizing density functional theory (DFT) method, the electrochemical isotherms (the relations between adsorbates' structures, coverage and the electrode potential) of the key reaction intermediates on catalysts' surface are computed. The reaction active sites, pathway and kinetics are then identified, with which the dependence between reactive activity and adsorption energy is established. The surface structure and nanoparticle size effects of catalysts are predicted, and some important experimental results are explained.			氢氧电催化反应是氢能源体系的重要反应, 其热力学和动力学直接影响水解制氢和燃料电池的能量效率和功率密度. 过去十多年来, 基于量子化学的理论计算在电催化剂设计及电催化反应机理研究中得到广泛应用. 结合文献结果, 本文介绍了近年来在Pt基催化剂表面氢、氧电催化反应理论计算研究中获得的结果和认识. 在研究中重点对反应中间体吸附结构、覆盖度及其对反应路径和动力学的影响机制进行了分析.结果指出, 反应中间体的吸附特性不仅会影响反应控制步骤的活化能, 同时通过改变表面反应活性位的结构和数量影响表面反应速率. 对火山顶点附近的Pt基催化剂, 简单计算的吸附能不足以准确预测催化剂活性, 必须考虑吸附质的覆盖度和吸附结构的影响. 在此认识基础上, 根据表面反应自由能及速率与关键中间体吸附能、覆盖度及电极电势的关系建立微观动力学模型, 利用密度泛函理论计算获得关键吸附中间体在催化剂表面的电化学吸附等温线(吸附结构及覆盖度与电极电势的关系), 确定反应活性位、反应路径和动力学, 构建催化活性与吸附能的关系曲线, 预测催化剂的表面结构及尺寸效应, 并对一些重要实验结果进行解释.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7224			CSCD:6006458

This work developed the dual-metal material system of Ni-Co nanoparticles wrapped in B-doped carbon (Ni1Co3@BC) through simple and economical pyrolysis process for nanosheets NiCo metal-organic framework (Ni1Co3-BDC) precursor. The constitution and structure of characterization were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope, indicating the homogeneous alloy and less metal boride phase and B doped graphitization structure for Ni1Co3@BC. An optimized Ni1Co3@BC exhibited extraordinary OER performance, providing an overpotential as small as 309 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 62 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability in 1.0 M KOH solution, which attributed to the synergistic effect of inner NiCo alloy, NiCo boride nanoparticles and external B doping carbon structure. The formation of B doped carbon layer not only provides additional active sites but also protects inner metal alloys. This work clearly stated the design and synthesis of desired-morphology features catalysts from controlled MOFs for energy conversation and storage.									17	1	0	0	0	0	17			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000573284600010

However, it suffers from high energy consumption for pollutants removal due to the side-reactions of hydrogen evolution reaction on cathode and oxygen evolution reaction on anode. Combining electro-Fenton (EF) with AO not only generated center dot OH for pollutants degradation but also increased current efficiency. This work investigated a synergic electrocatalysis process between EF and AO with Ti3+ self-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays (Ti3+/TNTAs) electrode as both cathode and anode for wastewater treatment. The pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constant of phenol degradation by EF+AO (0.107 min- 1) was 9.7 or 6.3 times as much as that of only EF (0.011 min- 1) or AO (0.017 min- 1) process, respectively. Enhanced pollutants removal of EF+AO could be attributed to the coexistence of center dot OH oxidation and direct oxidation on Ti3+/TNTAs surface. The COD of secondary effluent of coking wastewater decreased from 159.3 mg L-1 to 47.0 mg L-1 by EF+AO within 120 min with low specific energy consumption (9.5 kWh kg-1 COD-1). This work provided a new insight into design of the energy-efficient synergic electrocatalysis process for refractory pollutants degradation.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0304-3894	1873-3336		WOS:000734395900002	34823953

In this series of catalysts, Co4Fe2-LDHs/Co(OH)(2)-NWs exhibit excellent OER performance which is attributed to the most rational wire-in-plate nanostructure: the overpotentials of only 220 and 231 mV to drive current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1).

The nanowall network of Ni(OH)(2) sheets anchored on rGO layers with 10-15 nm wall thickness and ordered voids of average size 100 nm can serve as excellent candidates for catalyzing electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as they expose maximum edge sites of Ni(OH)(2) and allow diffusion and penetration of electrolytes into voids enhancing the contact area of the electrolyte/electrocatalyst interface. The unique morphology of the hybrid films exhibited high electrochemical surface area and low charge transfer resistance. Accordingly, rGO Ni(OH)(2) hybrid films display excellent catalytic activity and high cycling stability in alkaline solutions giving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 378 mV with a Tafel slope of 56 mVdec(-1). The hybrid films also exhibited a high specific and areal capacitance of 1402 Fg(-1) and 98.12 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 5 mVs(-1). OER activity and capacitance of the hybrid rGO Ni(OH)(2) films are higher compared to that of bare Ni(OH)(2) film and is attributed to the synergic effect between the rGO layer and the ordered interconnected nanowall Ni(OH)(2) nanostructures. The primary advantage of these hybrid films is that they can be collected on the desired substrate for ready use as electrodes without the use of any external binders.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2365-6549			WOS:000462083500002

Electrodes composed of LiCoO2 and LiCoPO4 exhibit progressive deactivation and activation for OER catalysis, respectively, upon potential cycling at neutral pH. The deactivation of LiCoO2 and activation of LiCoPO4 are coincident with changes in surface morphology and composition giving rise to spinel-like and amorphous surface structures, respectively. The amorphous surface structure of the activated LiCoPO4 is compositionally similar to that obtained from the electrodeposition of cobalt oxide materials from phosphate-buffered electrolyte solutions. These results highlight the importance of a combined structural and electrochemical analysis of the materials surface when assessing the true nature of the OER catalyst.									242	4	0	0	27	0	247			0002-7863			WOS:000309854700011	23033962

This research has prepared a series of FeOOH/Ni(HCO3)(2) heterostructured materials (denoted as FeOOHx/Ni(HCO3)(2)) by a one-pot solvothermal method. The OER performance of the catalysts was maximized by finely tuning the content of different components, heterogeneous interfaces, and electronic structures. Specifically, the obtained FeOOH0.60/Ni(HCO3)(2) heterostructured nanosheets had the lowest overpotential of 216 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and were stable at a high current density of 100 mA.cm(-2) for more than 96 h. The excellent OER activity and stability were still maintained in alkaline natural seawater (1 M KOH + seawater). When FeOOH0.60/Ni(HCO3)(2) was used as the anode for water splitting, the electrolyzer provided a current density of 10 m.A cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.51 V (1.56 V at 1 M KOH + seawater) and exhibited superior stability. The outstanding OER performance is ascribed to the synergistic effect of FeOOH and Ni(HCO3)(2) upon heterostructure formation, as well as the altered electronic structure between the heterogeneous interfaces and the suitable hierarchical nanosheet morphology facilitating many active sites. This work provides a promising direction for improving the electrocatalytic activity of nickel-based catalysts in seawater splitting, which has important implications for both hydrogen economy and environmental remediation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000865211100001

In this paper, we report a stainless steel fiber felt (SSF) electrode with greatly enhanced OER catalytic performance and durability. The SSF is directly treated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) method in alkaline electrolyte, which is more facile and convenient than the traditional measures. The characterization results of X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicate that an ultra-thin layer composed of Fe/Ni/Cr hydroxides/oxides with 3D open nanoporous structure is formed on the surface of SSF after CV treatment. The electrochemical tests show that the prepared SSF electrode displays a very low overpotential of 230 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 44 mV dec(-1) and good long-term durability of 550 h in 1 M KOH. The excellent OER performance of SSF electrode is contributed to the formation of hybrid metal hydroxides/oxides on its surface via in situ self-growth by electrochemical induction. Furthermore, the electrode only requires an overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M Na2CO3/NaHCO3 solution. It is expectable that the modified SSF will be a promising catalysis electrode for water-electrolysis in large-scale commercial production. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this paper, a hierarchical honey-comb catalyst NiSP supported on nickel foam (NF) was synthesized by a facile gradient electrodeposition method.

Benefited from the gradient electrodeposition process resulting in the nanoparticles decorate honey-comb structure, the electrochemical active surface area reaches to 3571.5 cm(2), and the turnover frequency (TOF) value is 2.0781 s(-1). Due to the good electric conductivity of phosphide and sulphide, NiSP/NF electrode kept to exhibit excellent stability for 60 h. Therefore, the electrode obtained by our gradient electrodeposition method was expected to be a promising candidate catalyst. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here an ultra-simple and environmental friendly strategy for fabricating metalorganic gels (MOGs) in terms of electrochemical overall water splitting was reported. Through electrochemical testing, the Ni0.6Fe0.4-MOG achieves the lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 285 mV (j(10)), 347 mV (j(100)), 445 mV (j(500)) (GC electrode) and 173 mV (j(10), NF electrode) in 1 M KOH, an ultra-low Tafel slope of 33 mV dec(-1) and long-term stability, outperforming most of the reported polymer catalysts. On account of the moderate hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance (159 mV (j(10))), thereby can drive the two-electrode electrolyzer at a relatively low cell voltage of 1.61 V (1.48 V when using Pt/C as cathode) and no significant attenuation after 20 h. Our work has demonstrated that the MOGs could break the shackles of current polymer catalysts for electrocatalysis.									14	2	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000703890500004

The optimized V-FeNi2P/NF with open-ended sites shows large electrochemically active surface area. Not surprisingly, the V-FeNi2P/NF displays remarkable electrocatalytic performances for both hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in 1.0 M KOH solution, with reduced overpotentials of 70 and 200 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The assembled water electrolyzer using V-FeNi2P/NF as the anode and cathode electrodes only needs a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) and shows excellent long-term stability and recoverability.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			2574-0962			WOS:000576676900141

Herein, we firstly use the globally generated green cornstalks as the carbon source to prepare highly efficient bifunctional pure beta-phase molybdenum carbide (beta-Mo2C) electrocatalysts. Due to the highly intrinsic activity of beta-Mo2C, high porosity of the resultant and synergistic effect between the Mo2C and carbon matrix, the as-prepared catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activities with low overpotentials of 130 mV and 274 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and OER, respectively. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting, the electrolyzer only needs a cell voltage of 1.65 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline water, as well as long-term stability of 30 h. This intriguing preparation strategy will open up an exciting new avenue for the synthesis of other carbides. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The prepared Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S NCs have defined stoichiometry and larger surface area, which revealed excellent electrocatalytic activities toward OER in alkaline condition. Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S nanocubes show an excellent electrocatalytic performance for the OER in 1 M KOH, which are superior to the state-of-the-art commercialized IrOx catalyst and most of MOFs derived OER catalyst. Furthermore, we also briefly study the different electrochemical oxidation driving (EOD) influence of Co0.4Fe0.28P and Co0.37Fe0.26S NCs for exposed more active sites and further discovering that sulfides show a better driving effect. We expect to give some inspiration on the design of OER catalysts with enhanced performance, and catalysts applied in other designs of the new catalyst.

Moreover, the as-synthesized sample presented preferable stability and after 10 h at 1.52 V the current density degraded by merely 8.3%.

At present, the product of solar N-2 fixation is either NH4+ or NO3-. Few reports described the simultaneous formation of ammonia (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) by a photocatalytic reaction and the related mechanism. In this work, we report a strategy to photocatalytically fix nitrogen through simultaneous reduction and oxidation to produce NH4+ and NO3- by W18O49 nanowires in pure water. The underlying mechanism of wavelength-dependent N-2 fixation in the presence of surface defects is proposed, with an emphasis on oxygen vacancies that not only facilitate the activation and dissociation of N-2 but also improve light absorption and the separation of the photoexcited carriers. Both NH4+ and NO3(-)can be produced in pure water under a simulated solar light and even till the wavelength reaching 730 nm. The maximum quantum efficiency reaches 9% at 365 nm. Theoretical calculation reveals that disproportionation reaction of the N-2 molecule is more energetically favorable than either reduction or oxidation alone. It is worth noting that the molar fraction of NH4+ in the total product (NH4+ plus NO3-) shows an inverted volcano shape from 365 nm to 730 nm. The increased fraction of NO3-. from 365 nm to around 427 nm results from the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at W sites without oxygen vacancies and the N-2 oxidation reaction (NOR) at oxygen vacancy sites, which is driven by the intrinsically delocalized photoexcited holes. From 427 nm to 730 nm, NOR is energetically restricted due to its higher equilibrium potential than that of OER, accompanied by the localized photoexcited holes on oxygen vacancies. Full disproportionation of N-2 is achieved within a range of wavelength from similar to 427 nm to similar to 515 nm. This work presents a rational strategy to efficiently utilize the photoexcited carriers and optimize the photocatalyst for practical nitrogen fixation.									16	1	0	0	1	0	16				2639-5274		WOS:000537415800001	32550602

To address this challenge, we obtained an outstanding high-performance OER catalyst by loading Ir on conductive antimony-doped tin oxide (ATO)-nanoparticles by a microwave (MW)-assisted hydrothermal route. The obtained Ir phase was identified by using XRD as amorphous (XRD-amorphous), highly hydrated Ir-III/IV oxohydroxide. To identify chemical and structural features responsible for the high activity and exceptional stability under acidic OER conditions with loadings as low as 20g(Ir)cm(-2), we used stepwise thermal treatment to gradually alter the XRD-amorphous Ir phase by dehydroxylation and crystallization of IrO2. This resulted in dramatic depletion of OER performance, indicating that the outstanding electrocatalytic properties of the MW-produced Ir-III/IV oxohydroxide are prominently linked to the nature of the produced Ir phase. This finding is in contrast with the often reported stable but poor OER performance of crystalline IrO2-based compounds produced through more classical calcination routes. Our investigation demonstrates the immense potential of Ir oxohydroxide-based OER electrocatalysts for stable high-current water electrolysis under acidic conditions.									49	0	0	0	3	0	49			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000401165900011	28164475

To achieve high efficiency and reduce the cost of electrolyzers, non-precious bifunctional electrocatalysts, which can operate in the same electrolyte, are highly required. Here, we report a facile method for synthesizing self-supported NiMo nitride nanowire arrays as high-performance, binder-free bifunctional electrocatalysts. The binder-free electrodes exhibit excellent catalytic activities with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials of 22 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction and 230 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. Remarkably, to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the full water splitting system assembled with the self-supported nanowire arrays only needs a cell voltage of 1.507 V, significantly lower than that of the electrolyzer based on Pt/C and IrO2 catalysts (1.540 V). Furthermore, the full water splitting system assembled with the self-supported NiMo nitride nanowire arrays shows an outstanding durability with a negligible current change at a large current density of 370 mA cm(-2) for 30 h continuous electrolysis. The results presented here demonstrate that the development of self-supported electrodes is an efficient way for fabricating a high-performance, low-cost, robust and stable full water splitting device.									108	4	0	0	7	0	109			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000434624800038

The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR) is considered as an alternative method with low energy consumption and mild condition. However, the NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) of the electrocatalyst are dominated by the competition between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and NRR. In order to achieve both high catalytic activity and high selectivity, the poor-performance catalyst needs to be improved via modification engineering. For the catalysts of oxygenated compounds, introducing oxygen vacancies (OVs) into the structure can enhance the catalytic property of NRR via regulating the local electronegativity and coordination environment. In this review, recent advances in the detection, preparation and application of OVs for NRR are summarized. We focus on the generating strategies of OVs and their evaluation method, including vacuum annealing, high-temperature hydrogen reduction, wet chemical, plasma treatment, and ion-doping strategy. Finally, the opportunities and challenges towards the suitable design of OVs in oxides for NRR are highlighted.									26	1	0	0	0	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000632069500005

A highly efficient catalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key factor influencing the performance of Li-O-2 batteries. In this work, a facile synthesis of an all-nanosheet architecture electrocatalyst constructed from a monolayer ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) nanosheet with a nitrogen doped sulfonated graphene nanosheet (RuO2-NS-GNS) has been developed for Li-O-2 batteries. This complex catalyst displays excellent activity towards the ORR and OER in both aprotic and aqueous Li-O-2 batteries. A low overpotential around 1.0 V during the discharge/recharge process is obtained for the aprotic Li-O-2 battery with RuO2-NS-GNS. Meanwhile, linear sweep voltammetry curves show that the OER and ORR potentials are 1.45 V and 0.81 V in an alkaline solution (1 M LiOH-5 M LiNO3) for RuO2-NS-GNS, respectively. Both aprotic and aqueous Li-O-2 batteries with RuO2-NS-GNS exhibit stable cyclability and low round-trip overpotential without obvious degradation at a limited specific capacity of 1000 mA g(-1). The advanced electrochemical performance of RuO2-NS-GNS in both aprotic and aqueous Li-O-2 batteries can be attributed to the increased catalytic sites and synergistic effect arising from RuO2 and NS-GNS nanosheets.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000459579400028	30681684

Herein, we report novel Fe3SnC and Sn nanoparticles anchored on N-doped carbon matrix (denoted as Fe-Sn@NC) as an efficient electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Owing to the simultaneous incorporation of Fe and Sn (metal loading up to 31 wt%), Fe-Sn@NC shows higher total N content, pyridinic N content, and electronic interaction between Fe and Sn compared with its single metal counterparts. Therefore, Fe-Sn@NC catalysts achieve half-wave potentials (E1/2) > 0.89 V vs. RHE and kinetic current densities > 4.1 mA cm-2 at 0.90 V vs. RHE. Apart from that, Fe-Sn@NC demonstrates fast mass transport as well as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. Finally, rechargeable Zn-air battery with Fe-Sn@NC as air electrode delivers a high open circuit voltage of 1.55 V, a high power density of 181 mW cm-2 and excellent durability. Our results demonstrate the excellent performance of novel Fe-Sn@NC catalyst for oxygen electrocatalysis and potential applications in practical energy conversion devices.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000862821900005

Herein, we employed a low cost and environmentally benign synthesis approach using plant extract as capping agent to synthesize bimetallic NiO/ZrO2 (nickel/Zirconiu mixed oxides; NZMO), and then studied their electrocatalytic properties. Results The synthesized material was characterized for its elemental, compositional and morphological feature elucidation. The phytocapping agents were probed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) which confirmed the active contribution of phytocompounds in synthesis as capping and stabilizing agents. Elemental and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) analysis manifested the presence of Ni, Zr and O content with morphological elucidations representing well-defined structures. The synthesized material was systematically investigated for electrocatalytic performance towards an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrochemical testing showed that the NZMO exhibits remarkable enhanced catalytic activity with 0.39 V overpotential value and 72 mV dec(-1) Tafel value at an existing density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable to that of precious metal catalysts. Conclusion Experimental investigation demonstrates that the remarkable OER performance of NZMO could be attributed to intrinsic catalytic properties originating as a result of binary materials. Moreover, the organic compounds involved in the synthesis mechanism also could be the major contributors in terms of provision of active sites due to protons. Thus, the present work presents a promising electrocatalytic material using mixed metal oxides and paves a novel path toward the green synthesis of binary oxides with improved electrocatalytic performance.

Herein, a novel nanoporous NiAl layered double hydroxide nanosheet array with optimized Ni active sites on nickel foam (np-NiAl-LDH/NF) is prepared by a facile and simple metal-defect engineering strategy. We demonstrate that the partial leaking of catalytically inactive Al sites in NiAl-LDH nanosheets during anodic electrochemical etching can not only trigger the generation of a nanoporous structure and electron-rich Ni2+ sites, but can also increase the content of Ni3+ active sites accompanied by abundant oxygen defects, resulting in the synchronously increased density and intrinsic activity of Ni active sites and also enhanced mass and electron transport, thus greatly promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. As expected, the as-obtained np-NiAl-LDH/NF electrode needs extremely small overpotentials of 90 and 180 mV to deliver the 10 mA cm(-2) current density for the HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, an alkaline electrolyzer assembled with np-NiAl-LDH/NF functioning as both the anode and cathode can yield 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) at quite low voltages of similar to 1.5 and 1.7 V, respectively, far outperforming the Pt/C/NF-IrO2/NF-coupled electrolyzer, and can give durable stability for at least 60 h. This work provides new insights for creating highly efficient Ni-based electrocatalysts toward overall water splitting via engineering on catalytically active Ni sites.									31	3	0	0	1	0	32			2398-4902			WOS:000539290400024

The as-developed dual-atom IrCo-N-C catalyst displays unprecedented activity with a half-wave potential of 0.911 V for oxygen reduction reaction and only 330 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction, outperforming the single-atom counterparts as well as the commercial Pt/C and Ir/C benchmarks. The impressive bifunctionality is also verified in a Zn-air battery prototype with an ultra-high cyclability over 450 cycles. Theoretical calculations are performed to shed light on the synergetic effects of the atomic pair site, where the incorporation of Ir atom alters the d-orbital energy level of Co and thus induces the re-arrangement of d-electron toward intensified spin polarization. As a result, the lower occupancy of d(z)(2) orbital facilitates the electron acceptation from oxygen to form a stronger Co-O sigma bond, thereby propelling faster reaction kinetics.									30	2	0	0	0	0	31			2155-5435			WOS:000674927200041

This is particularly true in electrodes for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involve multiple elementary steps and a substantial energy barrier. As a result, OER and ORR generally are rate-limiting step in electrode reactions. Here, we show Au nanocrystals enclosed by high-index facets (e.g. (310)) are more energetically and kinetically favorable than (111) facets for oxygen reduction in both lithium-air battery and fuel cell conditions. In both systems, the electric potential for oxygen reduction was reduced by 60-160 mV and the current increases by more than five times if high-index Au nanocrystals were utilized. These Au nanocrystals were synthesized at a temperature greater than the boiling point of ethylene glycol, the solvent used in this work. This synthetic approach opens a new reproducible route to synthesize nanocrystals with high-index facets because it is facile, rapid, and results in a large-quantity of nanocrystals with control over the size and morphology.

Using a novel cyclotetramerization, a task-specific bimetallic phthalocyanine-based nanoporous organic framework is successfully built as a precursor for the carbonization synthesis of a nonprecious OER electrocatalyst. The resultant material exhibits an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 280 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 and high durability in an alkaline medium. This impressive result ranks among the best from known Co-based OER catalysts under the same conditions. The simultaneous installation of multiple diverse cobalt-based active sites, including FeCo alloys and Co4N nanoparticles, plays a critical role in achieving this promising OER performance. This innovative approach not only enables high-performance OER activity to be achieved but simultaneously provides a means to control the surface features, thereby tuning the catalytic property of the material.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648			INSPEC:17655208

However, the bottom-up synthesis of atomically thick nanosheets is difficult for materials with inherent non-layered host crystals. Here, we demonstrate the preparation of single-unit-cell thick Co9S8 nanosheets frompreassembled Co-14 nanoclusters (NCs) by virtue of the flexibility of NC self-assembly in colloidal solution. Due to their free-standing properties, the NC self-assembled architectures are capable of bearing sulfurization at elevated temperatures, thus producing ultrathin Co9S8 nanosheets. The nanosheets exhibit an OER overpotential as low as 0.27 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1 M KOH, which is comparable to the performance of the best Co-based OER electrocatalysts.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000391736100029	27959361

The nature and role of surface states on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain however elusive. First-principles calculations were used to investigate surface states on hematite under photoelectrochemical conditions. The density of states for two relevant hematite terminations was calculated, and in both cases the presence and the role of surface states was rationalized. Calculations also predicted a Nerstian dependence on the OER onset potential on pH, which was to a very good extent confirmed by PEC measurements on hematite model photoanodes. Impedance spectroscopy characterization confirmed that the OER takes place via the same surface states irrespective of pH. These results provide a framework for a deeper understanding of the OER when it takes place via surface states.									106	4	0	0	5	0	107			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000345590300013	25283270

The local electronic environment of layered graphene/MoS2 interface is significantly influenced by doping with foreign atoms. Moreover, electrochemical robust hydrogen evolution at basal planes of vdW heterostructure and the underneath atomic-scale reaction mechanism is yet to be realised. We have investigated the mechanism of substitutional N-doping and its catalytic efficiency towards HER process on the basis of density functional theory. By analysing the electronic structure, free-energy diagrams, Volmer reaction paths and volcano plot analysis, it is inferred that nitrogen doping on graphene layer significantly modulate the hydrogen binding energies resulting in numerous orders of magnitude enhancement in HER activity. This study shows an optimal way to tune hydrogen binding on graphene/MoS2 heterostructure, an efficient electrocatalyst tending towards the value gained by platinum.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2365-6549			WOS:000401890300009

Recent measurements of the abundances of calcium, argon, and sulfur in type Ia supernova remnants have been interpreted in terms of metallicity-dependent oxygen burning, in accordance with previous theoretical predictions. It is known that a-rich oxygen burning results from O-16 -> C-12 followed by efficient C-12+C-12 fusion reaction, as compared to oxygen consumption by O-16 fusion reactions, but the precise mechanism of dependence on the progenitor metallicity has remained unidentified so far. I show that the chain O-16(p,alpha)N-13(gamma,p)C-12 boosts a-rich oxygen burning when the proton abundance is large, increasing the synthesis of argon and calcium with respect to sulfur and silicon. For high-metallicity progenitors, the presence of free neutrons leads to a drop in the proton abundance and the above chain is not efficient. Although the rate of O-16(p,alpha)N-13 can be found in astrophysical reaction rate libraries, its uncertainty is unconstrained. Assuming that all reaction rates other than O-16(p,alpha)N-13 retain their standard values, an increase by a factor of approximately seven of the O-16(p,alpha)N-13 rate at temperatures in the order 3-5 x 10(9) K is enough to explain the whole range of calcium-to-sulfur mass ratios measured in Milky Way and LMC supernova remnants. These same measurements provide a lower limit to the O-16(p,alpha)N-13 rate in the mentioned temperature range, on the order of a factor of 0.5 with respect to the rate reported in widely used literature tabulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-0746			WOS:000475553800002

We here report a controllable strategy for preparing the cobalt-nickel alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogen-doped porous carbon by annealing a bimetal-organic framework. The delicately tailored hierarchical Co2Ni@NC nanoparticles effectively realize abundant synergistic active sites and fast mass transfer for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Remarkably, the optimized Co2Ni@NC exhibits a small overpotential of 310 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and an excellent long-term stability in alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, the underlying synergistic effect mechanism of the Co-Ni model has been pioneeringly elucidated by density functional theory calculations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6				2046-2069		WOS:000629770100048	35423600

However, RuO2 suffers from the drawbacks of inferior OER performance in acidic conditions due to its poor stability. We here demonstrate a chemical etching strategy for fabricating a Ru/Fe oxide towards OER, in which Fe species in the pristine Ru/Fe nanoassemblies (P-Ru/Fe NAs) are partially etched by nitric acid (HNO3), leading to the generation of abundant vacancies in the etched Ru/Fe oxide nanoassemblies (E-Ru/Fe ONAs). Owing to the etching of Fe, the local electron density of the lattice O associated with Ru atoms is significantly increased, resulting in the suppression of H2O adsorption on lattice O. On the other hand, the O vacancies in the E-Ru/Fe ONAs can promote the H2O adsorption on metal atoms (i.e., Ru and Fe). Consequently, the optimized E-Ru/Fe ONAs exhibit a superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4, and an enhanced stability with a negligible potential change within 9 h chronopotentiometry test. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the defective surface of E-Ru/Fe ONA can not only enhance the stability via surface structural modulation, but also optimize the binding strength of the intermediates for promoting OER activity. This work provides an efficient strategy for fabricating active and stable RuO2-based catalysts for OER, which may deepen the research in surface engineering of catalysts.									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000649689100001

For the large-scale application of these technologies, highly efficient, low cost and stable electrocatalysts are very important. Recently, non-noble metal-based OER electrocatalyst has drawn fabulous research interest. Albeit, it may be difficult to include all the studies, this review aims to look over the recent progress and offer a comprehensive insight toward the OER. It begins with a fundamental introduction to the electrochemistry of OER electrocatalyst including the synthesis, and mechanism. In this review, a comprehensive investigation is made on various types of nanostructured materials including Co, Ni, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn-based transition metal oxide and multi-metal oxides such as spinels, perovskites, and layered double hydroxides. The crucial factors that are used to tune the activity of the catalyst towards OER are summarized, including nanostructure development, phase, morphology, crystal facet, defect, mixed-metal, and strain engineering for metal oxide, heteroatom doping, topological defects, and formation of metal-N-C composites. Finally, major applications, the current states challenges, and some perspectives for non-noble-metal-based OER electrocatalysts are discussed. This review will help to explore and develop better catalysts and units for practical applications and will offer a basic understanding of the OER process along with the standard parameters to evaluate the performance.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2666-5239			WOS:000739374600060

The typical hydroxide materials are used as precursors for developing lithium-containing bulk NCM oxide compositions upon calcination with lithium salts at higher temperatures and used as viable cathodes in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Nevertheless, the lithium-deficient typical NCM oxide composite (LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 or NCM-523) with a disordered structure was found to have superior electrocatalytic activity than its intact original structure for the water splitting reaction. Herein, we have elaborately investigated the electrocatalytic activity of the typical NCM hydroxide materials without lithium for the two significant compositions, viz., NCM-523 and NCM-811, prepared by a simple co-precipitation method for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline electrolyte for the first time. Interestingly, the NCM-811 composite exhibits improved catalytic activity with the lowest onset potential (similar to 1.5 V) and Tafel slope (similar to 91.7 mV dec(-1)) for better OER kinetics, whereas the NCM-523 composite exhibits a slightly higher onset potential (similar to 1.55 V) and Tafel slope (similar to 175.6 mV dec(-1)). The ideal composition showed a stable catalytic performance of 25 h continuous water electrolysis. This work can pave ways for the progress of plentiful multi-transition-metal-based hydroxides with virtually tunable compositions for cutting-edge affordable electrocatalytic materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000678382900017

Efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic water splitting are urgently demanded to decrease the overpotentials and promote the sluggish reaction kinetics. Carbon-based composites, including heteroatom-doped carbon materials, metals/alloys@carbon composites, metal compounds@carbon composites, and atomically dispersed metal sites@carbon composites have been widely used as the catalysts due to their fascinating properties. However, these electrocatalysts are almost powdery form, and should be cast on the current collector by using the polymeric binder, which would result in the unsatisfied electrocatalytic performance. In comparison, a self-supported electrode architecture is highly attractive. Recently, self-supported metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) constructed by coordination of metal centers and organic ligands have been considered as suitable templates/precursors to construct free-standing carbon-based composites grown on conductive substrate. MOFs-derived carbon-based composites have various merits, such as the well-aligned array architecture and evenly distributed active sites, and easy functionalization with other species, which make them suitable alternatives to non-noble metal-included electrocatalysts. In this review, we intend to show the research progresses by employment of MOFs as precursors to prepare self-supported carbon-based composites. Focusing on these MOFs-derived carbon-based nanomaterials, the latest advances in their controllable synthesis, composition regulation, electrocatalytic performances in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS) are presented. Finally, the challenges and perspectives are showed for the further developments of MOFs-derived self-supported carbon-based nanomaterials in electrocatalytic reactions.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000708577300001	34472663

In this context, we designed a hybrid carbon support having an earth-abundant metal as an interlayer between a Co3O4 electrocatalyst and a carbon support. The present approach resulted in an electrode that was three dimensional with high porosity, provided low resistance to parallel electron conduction pathways through the metallic interlayer, and modulated the electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4 by affecting its electronic structure. To rationalize the effect of the metal interlayer, a range of nonnoble earth-abundant metals (e.g. Cu, Mo, Ti, Al) were ex-plored, of which the Cu-modified carbon support resulted in maximum specific activity (i.e. activity per electrochemical surface area) for the OER. Whereas both the electronegativity and conductivity of the metal interlayer were found to influence the OER activity, the dominant controlling factor in the explored systems was conductivity. The specific activity of the OER of electrodeposited Co3O4 was found to have a near-linear relationship between the electrical conductivity and the electron-donor metals (e.g. Ti, Al) and another near-linear relationship having different intercepts with electron-acceptor metals (e.g. Cu, Mo, W). The above understanding can be useful in increasing the OER activity of electrocatalysts through support-electrocatalyst interactions.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2196-0216			WOS:000388382300023

In this article, a reduced graphene oxide-LaFeO3 (RGO-LaFeO3) nanocomposite electrocatalyst was synthesized by combining sol-gel and hydrothermal methods and using graphene oxide, lanthanum nitrate, ferric nitrate, and citric acid as raw materials. The prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The results confirmed that the RGO-LaFeO3 was composed of pure phase LaFeO3 with a perovskite structure and RGO and that the LaFeO3 nanoparticles were loaded uniformly on the RGO layer surface. In comparison with a LaFeO3 nanoparticle (NP-LaFeO3) catalyst, RGO-LaFeO3 exhibited superior activity for both the ORR and the OER when it served as the cathode of a lithium-oxygen battery. The higher catalytic activity of the RGO-LaFeO3 is attributed to the synergistic effect of the special three-dimensional electronic conductive structure of RGO and the intrinsic catalytic property of LaFeO3. It was shown that the lithium-oxygen battery with the RGO-LaFeO3 cathode can be cycled stably up to 36 reversible cycles under conditions of a limit discharge depth of 1000 mAh.g(-1) and a 100 mAg(-1) current density for charge-discharge. The study illustrates that the RGO-LaFeO3 bifunctional electrocatalyst is a promising candidate for the cathode in lithium-oxygen batteries.									1	1	0	0	0	0	2			1000-6818			WOS:000409322900019

The mutant cia3, lacking Cah3 activity, has an impaired water splitting capacity, as shown for intact cells, thylakoids and PSII particles. To compensate this impairment, the mutant overproduces PSII reaction centres (1.6 times more than wild type). We present compelling evidence that the mutant has an average of two manganese atoms per PSII reaction centre. When bicarbonate is added to mutant thylakoids or PSII particles, the O-2 evolution rates exceed those of the wild type by up to 50%. The donor side of PSII in the mutant also exhibits a much higher sensitivity to overexcitation than that of the wild type. We therefore conclude that Cah3 activity is necessary to stabilize the manganese cluster and maintain the water-oxidizing complex in a functionally active state. The possibility that two manganese atoms are enough for water oxidation if bicarbonate ions are available is discussed.									73	2	7	0	76	0	81			0261-4189	1460-2075		WOS:000175274700006	11953312

Herein, we realize the simultaneous morphology and phase transformation from alpha-MnO2 nanorods, large-size MnOOH nanorods to MnOOH nanoparticles by adding different content of N-CDs in the synthesizing alpha-MnO2 process. Benefitting from the unique structures, synergistic effect between Mn-based oxides/oxyhydroxides and N-CDs, various active oxide species and large specific surface areas, the as-prepared Mn-based oxides/oxyhydroxides@CDs with different morphologies show excellent electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH. Impressively, the large-size MnOOH@CDs(0.2) display high electrocatalytic performance with the overpotential of 302 mV to reach to 10 mA cm(-2) along with a Tafel slope of 51.3 mA dec(-1). More importantly, by coupling the MnOOH@CDs(0.2) with Pt/C for overall water splitting, a cell potential of merely 1.56 V is required to reach to 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, in the process of stability studies, the key role of the (111) crystal plane in the catalytic process is established. Meanwhile, the MnOOH@CDs(0.2) also shows excellent stability for continuous 72 h chronopotentiometry test. The proposed strategy showed here represents a facile and suitable method for the simultaneous transformation of the morphology and phase of Mnbased oxides/oxyhydroxides with the assistance of N-CDs for efficient energy conversion.

Two POM@ZIF nanocomposite materials-SiW9Co3@ZIF-8 and SiW9Co3@ZIF-67-were successfully prepared via a room temperature in situ approach, by the immobilization of POM anions [SiW9Co3(H2O)(3)O-37](10-)(SiW9Co3) in the cages of two isostructural ZIFs: ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, formed with Zn2+ and Co2+, respectively. Despite both SiW9Co3@ZIF-8 and SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 revealing similar and low occupancy degrees (ca. 6 POM units per 100 ZIF-cages), an intense synergy has been detected in the ZIF-67 based nanocomposite, while no synergistic interaction was found for POMs and ZIF-8. Due to this synergistic effect, the OER activity of SiW9Co3@ZIF-67 is significantly enhanced in comparison with that of ZIF-67: similar to 110 mV decreased overpotential and double current density. Additionally, this nanocomposite exhibits excellent stability in the alkaline electrolyte. Insights into the nature and magnitude of the SiW(9)Co(3)ZIF-67 synergy have shown up its interesting ZIF <-> POM bidirectional nature that involves activation of the Co-based active sites in POM clusters as a consequence of a ZIF-67 -> SiW9Co3 electron transfer, along with POM-induced generation of more active unsaturated Co-nodes in the ZIF-67 frameworks. These findings represent a promising proof of concept for the development of more efficient POM@MOF-based electrocatalysts in the future.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			2574-0962			WOS:000526598300095

The oxidation process is always controlled by the reactivity of pyrite, which in turn is controlled by its surface structure. In this study, the oxidation behavior of naturally existing {100}, {111}, and {210} facets of pyrite was investigated using a comprehensive approach combining X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry with periodic density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. The experimental results show that (i) the initial oxidation rates of both pyrite {111} and {210} are much greater than that of pyrite {100}; (ii) the initial oxidation rate of pyrite {210} is greater than that of pyrite {111} in low relative humidity, which is reversed in high relative humidity; and (iii) inner sphere oxygen-bearing sulfur species are originally generated from surface reactions and then converted to outer sphere species. The facet dependent rate law can be expressed as: r({hkl}) = k({hkl})h(a)P(0.5) (t + 1)(-0.5), where r({hkl}) is the orientation dependent reaction rate, k{hkl} is the orientation dependent rate constant, h is the relative humidity, P is the oxygen partial pressure, and t is the oxidation time in seconds. {111} is the most sensitive facet for pyrite oxidation. Combined with DFT theoretical investigations, water catalyzed electron transfer is speculated as the rate-limiting step. These findings disclose the structure-reactivity dependence of pyrite, which not only presents new insight into the mechanism of pyrite oxidation but also provides fundamental data to evaluate sulfur speciation evolution, suggesting that the surface structure sensitivity should be considered to estimate the reactivity at the mineral-water interface.

Despite considerable progress over the past decade in this field, no water-splitting electrocatalyst with selectivity between the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) has been reported so far, to the best of our knowledge. Here, we develop a unique, customizable water-splitting electrocatalyst by systematically modulating the doping of the nonmetal element sulfur (S) into cobalt molybdate using thioacetamide (TAA) as a sulfur precursor. The resultant S-doped cobalt molybdate electrocatalysts showed unexpectedly high selectivity, i.e., the OER and HER activities could be freely adjusted through tuning the sulfur doping level. In the case of a high TAA/cobalt molybdate mass ratio of 1.6, the S-doped sample was highly selective for HER, achieving an excellent electrocatalytic activity comparable to those of previously reported state-of-the-art transition-metal (Co, Ni, and Fe)-based HER electrocatalysts. In sharp contrast, when the TAA/cobalt molybdate mass ratio was as low as 0.4, the S-doped sample was remarkably selective for OER with outstanding catalytic activity that even outperformed the commercial RuO2 catalyst.									13	3	0	0	0	0	13			2574-0962			WOS:000458706700005

Herein, iron-doped, carbon-coated Co3O4 nanocomposite derived from a cobalt metal-organic framework, is grown in-situ on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Fe-Co3O4@C/FTO) as an efficient and a stable binder-free electrode for acidic OER. Fe doping enhances both catalytic efficiency and stability of carbon coated Co3O4 toward acidic OER, through inducing small primary particle sizes and suitably modulated electronic structure of Co3O4, and better catalyst/substrate adhesion. Fe-Co3O4@C/FTO exhibits impressive electrocatalytic performances in 0.5 M H2SO4, with a low overpotential of 396 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 68.6 mV dec(-1) . Its electrochemical performances remain stable for over 50 h at 10 mA cm(-2), making it a promising non-noble metal based electrocatalyst for acidic OER.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000720473800001

This catalyst was prepared by thermal decomposition of nitrate precursors on titanium and nickel supports. Scanning electron microscopy analysis and electrochemical surface area measurements indicate that the electrodes are highly porous. Such preparation variables as the concentration of the mixed nitrates in isopropanol, the temperature of nitrate decomposition, the time of annealing, the catalyst loading, the nature of the substrate, the air flow during the thermal decomposition, and the cooling rate of the electrode have been investigated in detail to determine their influence on the morphology, the composition, the mechanical stability, and the electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution of the oxide films. It is shown that the performances can be ascribed to the variation in the roughness factor of the oxide layers. At 400-degrees-C, a resistive phase, presumably CuO, is formed and dispersed on the surface of Cu0.9Co2.1O4. This has a deleterious effect on the electrocatalytic activity. Copper cobalt oxide is oxidized and reduced prior to the oxygen evolution through a reaction which can involve the formation of the Co(IV)/Co(III) redox couple on the surface of cobaltite. The material prepared on nickel at 275-degrees-C for 1 h at a catalyst loading of 3.3 Mg CM-2 shows fairly low overvoltages for oxygen evolution.									105	1	0	0	3	0	106			0013-4651			WOS:A1992JD39200021

The unusual rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid NSs allow the electrochemical reactions of electrodes for supercapacitors. Therefore, an excellent specific capacitance (ca. 450F/g at 2mV/s) and stability performance of the rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid NSs were observed in alkaline medium (i.e. 5 M KOH electrolyte). The rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid NSs show five times higher specific capacitance compared to pure CoMoO4 NSs. The cyclic stability of the rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid NSs reveals retention of approximately 98% of the initial capacitance after 1500 cycles. Moreover, the rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid electrocatalyst shows higher oxygen evolution activity than CoMoO4 NSs in 0.1M KOH versus Ag/AgCl. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and chronoamperometric (CA) measurements strongly support the enhanced electrochemical performance of the rGO/CoMoO4 hybrid NSs.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2196-0216			WOS:000471342200021

Excitingly, the 3D NiFe-LDH/rGO@NF composites exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance. By analyzing the microstructure and electrochemical properties of NiFe-LDH/rGO@NF, the synergistic effect of 3D-NF and 2D-rGO on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrocatalysis performance in 3D NiFe-LDH/rGO@NF was explored. The results show that the composite structure composed of 2D rGO and 3D NF is synergistic with each other. On the one hand, this composite structure can very effectively increase the specific surface area to inhibit agglomeration and expose abundant active sites of LDH. On the other hand, both rGO and NF can enhance the electrical conductivity of NiFe-LDH and improve the transportability of electrons and ions due to the excellent electrical conductivity. Additionally, the 3D NiFe-LDH/rGO@NF exhibits excellent OER catalytic performance, with an overpotential of 277 mV at 50 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 59.9 mV/dec.

Scrutiny on the hybrid arrays indicates that the chemical bath deposition method favors the growth of the MnO2 nanotubes with different diameter which can modulate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as well as bandgap width of the hybrid. In terms of OER activity, onset potential (E-s) shifts negatively from 0.698 V (vs.Ag/AgCl) of pristine titania nanotube arrays (TNAs) to 0.501 V of the hybrid loaded with 26.6%wt MnO2, and the current density on the hybrid electrode can be significantly enhanced up to 20.87 mA/cm(2), almost 97 times higher than that on TNAs electrode (0.214 mA/cm(2)). Optical absorption measurement suggests that the bandgap width (E-g) can be tuned by loading MnO2 onto the TNAs implying interaction between the MnO2 and TNAs. The MnO2@TiO2 hybrid nanotube arrays may find promising potential in electrochemical water splitting, photocatalysis, thermocatalysis and other sustainable energy applications.

J	Keough, James M.; Zuniga, Ashley N.; Jenson, David L.; Barry, Bridgette A.								Redox Control and Hydrogen Bonding Networks: Proton-Coupled Electron Transfer Reactions and Tyrosine Z in the Photosynthetic Oxygen-Evolving Complex								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				117	5			1296	1307		10.1021/jp3118314				FEB 7 2013	2013	In photosynthetic oxygen evolution, redox active tyrosine Z (YZ) plays an essential role in proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. Four sequential photooxidation reactions are necessary to produce oxygen at a Mn4CaO5 cluster. The sequentially oxidized states of this oxygen-evolving cluster (OEC) are called the S-n states, where n refers to the number of oxidizing equivalents stored. The neutral radical, YZ center dot, is generated and then acts as an electron transfer intermediate during each S state transition. In the X-ray structure, YZ, Tyr161 of the D1 subunit, is involved in an extensive hydrogen bonding network, which includes calcium-bound water. In electron paramagnetic resonance experiments, we measured the YZ center dot recombination rate, in the presence of an intact Mn4CaO5 cluster. We compared the S-0 and S-2 states, which differ in Mn oxidation state, and found a significant difference in the YZ center dot decay rate (t(1/2) = 3.3 +/- 0.3 s in S-0; t(1/2) = 2.1 +/- 0.3 s in S-2) and in the solvent isotope effect (SIE) on the reaction (1.3 +/- 0.3 in S-0; 2.1 0.3 in S-2). Although the YZ site is known to be solvent accessible, the recombination rate and SIE were pH independent in both S states. To define the origin of these effects, we measured the YZ center dot recombination rate in the presence of ammonia, which inhibits oxygen evolution and disrupts the hydrogen bond network. We report that ammonia dramatically slowed the YZ center dot recombination rate in the S-2 state but had a smaller effect in the S-0 state. In contrast, ammonia had no significant effect on YD center dot, the stable tyrosyl radical. Therefore, the alterations in YZ center dot decay, observed with S state advancement, are attributed to alterations in OEC hydrogen bonding and consequent differences in the YZ midpoint potential/pK(a). These changes may be caused by activation of metal-bound water molecules, which hydrogen bond to YZ. These observations document the importance of redox control in proton-coupled electron transfer reactions.									21	0	0	0	8	0	21			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000314908100012	23346921

The overall photocatalytic activity of the CdS photocatalyst has been predicted based on the electronic structures, band edge alignment, and overpotential calculations. For comparisons, we have also investigated the water splitting process over bulk CdS. The band edge alignment along with the oxygen evolution reaction/hydrogen evolution reaction (OER/HER) mechanism studies help us find out the effective overpotential for the overall water splitting on these surfaces. Our study shows that the CdS NT has a highly stabilized valence band edge compared to that of bulk CdS owing to strong p-d mixing. The highly stabilized valence band edge is important for the hole-transfer process and reduces the risk of electron-hole recombination. CdS nanotube requires less overpotential for water oxidation reaction than the bulk CdS. Our findings suggest that the efficiency of the water oxidation/reduction process further improves in CdS as we reduce its dimensionality, that is going from bulk CdS to one-dimensional nanotube. Furthermore, the stabilized valence band edge of CdS nanotube also improves the photostability of CdS, which is a problem for bulk CdS.									14	1	0	0	3	0	15			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000457714700006	30485628

Herein, a composite material consisting of cobalt-cobalt phosphide nanoparticles in situ coupled with N-doped carbon (Co-Co2P @ NC) is conveniently engineered via a facile all-in-one carbonization/phosphorization process. Specifically, Co-Co2P @ NC implements unprecedented bifunctional catalytic activities with a positive ORR half-wave potential of 0.858 V and a low OER potential of 1.598 V at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the benchmark catalysts and is on a par with recently reported non-precious metal-based catalysts. These impressive electrocatalytic performances are attributable to the synergistic coupling effects between metallic Co, Co2P and NC, extraordinary specific surface area, rich active species and conductive carbon frameworks. Prominently, a rechargeable aqueous ZAB with Co-Co2P @ NC as an air cathode catalyst delivers an ultra-long term cycling stability of more than 2000 h (over continuous 6000 cycles) with a small change of charge-discharge voltage gap from 0.841 V to 0.890 V at 2 mA cm(-2). Beyond that, both button-like and foldable quasi-solid-state ZABs also exhibit admirable performance even under the limited electrolyte condition, evidently indicating the wide adaptability and feasibility in practical energy conversion and storage.

However, recent works have revealed that a single mechanism is not at play across oxide chemistries. These works underscore a need to deeply investigate the electronic structure details of active oxide catalysts and how they align with the OER potential, which is critical to understanding the interfacial charge-transfer kinetics that dictate catalytic mechanisms. In this work, we use soft X-ray emission and absorption spectroscopy of perovskites to analyze the partial density of states on an absolute energy scale, from which energetic barriers for electron transfer and surface deprotonation were estimated and correlated with OER activity. Through this lens, we identify that decreasing the solid-state charge-transfer energy of perovskites can change the mechanisms of the OER from electron-transfer-limited to proton-electron-coupled, to proton-transfer-limited reactions. This concept is supported by the analysis of potential energy surfaces for sequential and concerted proton-electron transfer pathways using a Marcus model. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the physical origin of experimental OER activity trends with electronic descriptors and the need to promote surface deprotonation from oxides to discover new catalysts with enhanced activity.									271	9	0	0	22	0	273			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000412765600013

The surface features were extensively characterized using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. On FeNi-modified carbon the overpotential for OER was very low (280 mV) and comparable to that on noble metal catalyst IrO2. The electrochemical properties have been investigated to reveal the difference between the binary alloy- and single metal-doped carbons. This work demonstrates a significant step for the development of low-cost, environmentally-friendly and highly-efficient OER catalysts.									14	4	0	0	0	0	14			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000572605900001

The high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAAD-STEM) characterizations and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis reveal that the Pt frames have a thickness of less than 2 nm, which surround a nickel core thus forming a quasi core-shell concave octahedral nanoparticle (NP). The element-specific anisotropic growth followed by the nanoscale phase segregation and subsequent oxidation of Ni riched facets are responsible for the formation of the concave nanostructure. The PtNi3 quasi core-shell concave octahedrons exhibit substantially enhanced electrocatalytic properties toward methanol oxidation and hydrogen evolution reaction compared with that of the commercial Pt/C, suggesting that the Ni riched Pt-Ni NPs can be used as a potential candidate for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts with the low utilization of Pt.									53	4	0	0	1	0	54			1932-7447			WOS:000366878500008

Exploration of noble-metal-free, highly-efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts for HER and OER remains a challenge. In this work, Co-Ta3N5 catalysts were successfully prepared by in situ confined growth of active catalytic species within porous nanofilm using three-dimensional (3D) tantalum nitride (Ta3N5) porous nanofilm as templates. After electrochemical testing, we found that Co-Ta3N5 nanohybrid exhibits excellent OER and HER performance. Benefiting from the 3D composite nanostructures, the catalysts have excellent electron conduction rates and sufficient active sites, the Co-Ta3N5 nanocomposites nitrided at 800 degrees C exhibits relatively good catalytic activity for HER in acidic (low overpotential of 59.1 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec(-1)) and alkaline (low overpotential of 93 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), Tafel slope of 97 mV dec(-1)) media, respectively. Co-Ta3N5-800 also exhibits relatively good catalytic activity for OER with low overpotentials 358 mV at 10 mA cm(-1) in 1M KOH and the Tafel slope of 58.5 mV dec(-1). Additionally, Co-Ta3N5-800 possesses excellent catalytic performance, and its catalytic performance with almost no degradation in catalytic performance after severe electrochemical tests, which ascribe to the structure of cobalt nanoparticles that confined-growth in Ta3N5 nanotubes. This discovery may pave a new avenue toward the development of robust inexpensive electrocatalysts for OER and HER. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we propose dual-phase engineering of self-supported hierarchical trimetallic NiCoV double hydroxides (NiCoV(OH)(x)) nanowire arrays for enhanced electrocatalytic OER activity via increased surface reaction sites and charge transfer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy analyses are performed to demonstrate the chemical composition and structural features of the synthesized electrocatalysts. Self-supported NiCoV(OH)(x) shows better OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of similar to 320 mV at a current density of 50 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope (similar to 114 mV/dec) in 1 M KOH electrolyte medium. Furthermore, NiCoV(OH)(x) exhibits a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct; similar to 0.63 Omega) and a larger Cdl value (similar to 77 mF/cm(2)) than NiCo(OH)(x) (similar to 1.22 Omega, 53 mF/cm(2)) and NiCoV(OH)(x) (similar to 1.86 Omega, 46 mF/cm(2)), suggesting faster electrocatalytic kinetics. NiCoV(OH)(x) displays remarkable electrochemical stability at a high current density of 50 mA/cm(2) for 10 h without significant changes in the OER activity. Owing to its greater abundance of catalytic active sites, high conductivity, faster charge transfer kinetics, and close contact with the electrolyte, NiCoV(OH)(x) exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance and stability toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000691263100003

In this scope, transition metal oxides constitute an emerging alternative to Ir and Ru oxides. Notably, Mn oxides are among the few that have sufficient stability in acidic electrolytes, but their performance still lacks behind Ir/Ru oxides. To this end, the modification of Mn oxides' structure, crystallinity (or amorphous structure), and/or composition may work to enhance their catalytic activity. In this report, we focused our attention on the development of mixed-metal Mn-Fe-based catalysts containing highly electronegative fluorine ions as acidstable OER catalysts. Inspired by our recent work on the preparation Mn-Fe-based fluorinated materials MnFe2F8(H2O)(2) and MnFe2F5.8O1.1, a new hydrated fluoride, MnFeF5(H2O)(2), was prepared by microwave-assisted solvothermal synthesis and its subsequent thermal treatment under air yielded the corresponding oxyfluoride MnFeF4.6O0.2. The resultant composition and structure of the materials were determined from powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), Mossbauer spectrometry, thermal analyses, and electronic microscopies. The crystalline-hydrated fluorides (MnFeF5(H2O)(2) and MnFe2F8(H2O)(2)) and the corresponding amorphous oxyfluorides (MnFeF4.6O0.2 and MnFe2F5.8O1.1) were subsequently evaluated for the first time as OER electrocatalysts in highly acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) media. Notably, the oxyfluorides featured sustained OER activity at 10 mA/cm(2) for more than 10 h and, thus, present an important addition to the growing library of earth-abundant alternatives to Ir and Ru oxides.									10	1	0	0	0	0	10			2574-0962			WOS:000621660800016

In our work, NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) was electrodeposited on Ni3S2 nanosheets on nickel foam (NF), which exhibits a better performance compared with RuO2, and a low overpotential of 200 mV is needed to reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) in 1 M KOH. Notably, the Ni3S2/NiFe LDH only need an overpotential of 273 mV to reach the current density of 200 mA/cm(2). (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CrNiCo-P/GCN demonstrates favorable charge resistance and electrical conductance due to its intrinsic properties. It exhibits an admirable OER overpotential of 290 mV with a lower Tafel plot value of 125 mV dec(-1) in alkaline media and compared with the control samples. Furthermore, this composite also demonstrates high performance in electrochemical sensing of ROX over a wide concentration range of 1-413 mu M with a lower limit of detection (LOD) of 31 nM in phosphate buffer.

The amorphous silica formed in the anode surface during the electrochemical process is multifunctional, as it protects the electrode substrate from corrosion and acts as electrocatalysts for OER.

Tracking the role of Fe in NiFe-layered double hydroxide for solar water oxidation and prototype demonstration towards PV assisted solar water-splitting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				46	2			2143	2155		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.10.129				JAN 6 2021	2021	NiFe based layered hydroxides (LDH) is an efficient oxygen evolution catalysts used in energy conversion and storage devices. Herein, we used in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to study the role of Fe in improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of NiFe-LDH, as an alternative to expensive techniques. Optimized Ni0.46Fe0.54-LDH showed Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1) and over potential of similar to 340 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Increase in Fe content in NiFe-LDH, lowered the average oxidation of the Ni, revealing the stabilization of lower oxidation state of Ni. Potential dependent EIS supported this effect showing that multi-metal LDH favors the surface intermediate stabilization thereby reducing the overall charge transfer resistance at interface compared to mono metal catalysis. Surface intermediate relaxation process is dependent on Fe content and is playing a role in deciding the rate limiting step. The Fe-O-Ni linkages in FeOx-NiFe-LDH systems exert partial charge transfer activation for OER process. A prototype demonstration of overall water splitting using a photovoltaic-electrolyser assembly is conducted with Ni0.46Fe0.54-LDH as bifunctional catalysts which yields a constant current density of similar to 10 mA cm(-2) at a V-oc = 1.65 V. Present study provide experimental evidence of improved activity of FeOx-NiFe-LDH with the help of potential dependent EIS studies and makes practically attractive for renewable energy conversion and storage applications.

In Nature, photosynthetic H2O oxidation processes occur in photosystem-II (PS-II) and are facilitated by the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), a manganese-oxo cluster {Mn4CaO5} with cubane-like topology. In recent years, the use of manganese-based H2O oxidation catalysts has attracted significant scientific attention, not only to mimic and understand naturally occurring processes, but also due to the low toxicity and high abundancy of Mn in the Earth's crust. Here we report the catalytic H2O oxidation activity at pH 7.2 of a high-nuclearity manganese-oxo cluster. The species, which contains multiple cubane motifs and which is stabilized by redox-active aromatic organic ligands, gives rise to an onset overpotential as low as 255 mV when dispersed in a carbon paste matrix, achieving high current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and even 100 mA cm(-2) at eta = 482 and 654 mV, respectively. The electrodes show good stability under turnover conditions for 7 h. Additionally, direct light-induced O-2 evolution measurements confirm a reaction rate of 0.72 s(-1) and turnover number (TON) of up to 55. The outlined experimental concept demonstrates how a synergistic effect between non-innocent, redox-active organic ligands and bioinspired Mn oxo-clusters resembling the natural {Mn4CaO5} unit, which are dispersed in a conductive carbon matrix and protected by a Nafion membrane, can facilitate remarkably high catalytic activity under neutral, environmentally friendly pH conditions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000572823400010

First-row transition metals are used extensively as electrocatalysts in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems. These electrocatalysts undergo transformations in their phase and surface morphology, which are induced by oxidizing potentials in the alkaline medium. A template-assisted approach to prepare electrodes with regular surface morphologies was used to monitor interactions between the NPs and their support both before and after prolonged electrochemical aging. A template-assisted method was used to prepare uniform surface inclusions of nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) NPs on conductive nickel (Ni) supports for evaluation toward the OER Electron microscopy-based methods were used to assess the resulting transformations of the embedded NPs within the Ni support matrix. Electrochemical aging of these textured electrodes was conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques, which resulted in the growth of a 200 nm thick Ni oxy(hydroxide) film on the surfaces of the Ni supports. The growth of the active surface layer led to the encapsulation of the NiFe2O4 NPs as determined by correlative energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) techniques. The NP-modified electrodes exhibited reduced overpotentials and higher sustained current densities for the OER when compared to pure Ni supports. The well-defined morphologies and NP surface inclusions prepared by the template-assisted approach could serve as a platform for investigating additional NP-support interactions for electrocatalytic systems.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000510104700046

Secondary phases disappeared with increase in the pH value, and the singlephase BaNiO3 was successfully synthesized at pH 10. The specific surface area was similar to 32 m(2) g(-1), which is significantly enhanced compared to the BaNiO3 (0.3 m(2) g(-1)) synthesized by flux-mediated crystal growth. The BaNiO3 was used as an oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and the specific mass activity was similar to 5 times higher than that of the BaNiO3 synthesized by flux-mediated crystal growth. As a result, the ethylenediamine-derived sol-gel synthesis could be a simple technique to prepare crystalline compounds such as perov-skites and spinels, with unusually high-valence transition metals.									9	0	0	0	0	0	8			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000382122200004	27470485	
J	LIAN, KK; KIRK, DW; THORPE, SJ								INVESTIGATION OF A 2-STATE TAFEL PHENOMENON FOR THE OXYGEN EVOLUTION REACTION ON AN AMORPHOUS NI-CO ALLOY								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				142	11			3704	3712		10.1149/1.2048402				NOV 1995	1995	The anodic polarization for the oxygen evolution reaction of many metals and metal alloys results in the measurement of two Tafel regions, one for low overpotentials and one for high overpotentials. The polarization of the amorphous Ni50Co25P15B10 alloy resulted in the measurement of a Tafel plot which appeared to have two different states linked by a transition potential region that was dependent on electrode pretreatment. A ''limiting current'' phenomenon in the transition region, in which the current appears to be independent of the potential, on the amorphous Ni50Co25P15B10 alloy was observed. The limiting-current phenomenon in the transition region may reflect changes of the electrode surface oxidation states and the oxygen reaction mechanisms in the two Tafel regions. This limiting current transition region was investigated by de anodic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). A time-dependent impedance behavior was observed coincident with a limiting current in the Tafel plot within the same potential region. This was further characterized by means of a fixed frequency impedance measurement. XPS spectra of oxidation species of Ni were obtained from the amorphous Ni50Co25P15B10 alloy and were compared with the spectra of chemically synthesized Ni oxide and hydroxides. The XPS results from the amorphous Ni-Co alloy electrode polarized in the two Tafel regions revealed different surface chemistries. The ''limiting current'' phenomenon could thus be attributed to a slow surface place exchange between Ni and Co sites and a further oxidation of the surface from the low overpotential Tafel region to the high overpotential Tafel region.									90	4	0	0	5	0	92			0013-4651			WOS:A1995TD93300023

Herein, the NiS@N/S-C nanocomposites composed of NiS particles embedded in N/S co-doped carbon substrate were synthesized by carbonization of metalorganic framework (MOF) of the Ni (II) complex with vanillic thiosemicarbazone. The MOF-derived NiS@N/S-C hybrids exhibited excellent electrochemical performance for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution, yielding a low onset potential of 1.54 V (vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode), and the potential only changed 10 mV after chronopotentionmetric response at 10 mA cm(-2) for 10 h. The resulted high OER activity and strong stability of hybrids was derived from the active NiS nanostructure characteristic and the well-dispersed NiS nanoparticles encapsulated in carbon substrate formed in situ, the strong interaction between NiS particles and substrate species, as well as co-doping effect of N/S atoms on substrates. Our work gave a new method to prepare catalysts and demonstrated that NiS@N/S-C nanocomposite was a promising non-precious catalyst for water splitting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The involvement of oxidation state changes of the metal in OER electrocatalysis is increasingly recognized in the literature. Tracing these oxidation states under operation conditions could provide relevant information for performance optimization and development of durable catalysts, but further methodical developments are needed. Here, we propose a strategy to use single-energy X-ray absorption spectroscopy for monitoring metal oxidation-state changes during OER operation with millisecond time resolution. The procedure to obtain time-resolved oxidation state values, using two calibration curves, is explained in detail. We demonstrate the significance of this approach as well as possible sources of data misinterpretation. We conclude that the combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy with electrochemical techniques allows us to investigate the kinetics of redox transitions and to distinguish the catalytic current from the redox current. Tracking of the oxidation state changes of Co ions in electrodeposited oxide films during cyclic voltammetry in neutral pH electrolyte serves as a proof of principle.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000673690700001	34274992

In this direction, we developed synergistic Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts by combining low-cost surface passivated or functionalized ZnO nanorods (F. ZnO NRs) structures with stainless-steel mesh (SSM/F. ZnO NRs) as three-dimensional (3D) structures and demonstrated excellent water-splitting characteristics. Here, SSM/ZnO nanorods structures were initially passivated by electrochemical deposition of ultrathin cobalt oxide (Co3O4) layers and analyzed with advanced analytical techniques even before and after OER catalysis. As individual materials, either stainless-steel or Co3O4 deposited ZnO nanostructures possess very low catalytic activity, whereas their integrated 3D structures showed unusual catalytic performance as OER anodes. As compared to SSM and SSM/ZnO structures, Co3O4 passivated SSM/ZnO structures exhibit very low overpotential (-290 V for the current density of 10 mA/cm2) with a reduced Tafel slope of 59 mV/dec along with excellent cycling stability and durability even for longtime energy productions. The establishment of large surface-area and fine energy band alignments along with favorable interfaces formed between SSM, ZnO@Co3O4, and electrolyte||Pt structures, presence of Co3O4 as a passive cum protective layer, and synergistic effects play significant roles in the predominantly enhanced catalytic activity of SSM/F.

Due to growing concerns regarding the validity of Pt counter electrodes in such measurements, largely attributed to their dissolution and redeposition, graphite is increasingly being employed as a versatile counter electrode in conventional three-electrode systems. However, the reliability of graphite in this role has not been fully investigated. Herein, we have demonstrated that using graphite as a counter electrode can significantly hinder the precise evaluations of electrocatalytic materials. For a polycrystalline Pt surface coupled with a graphite counter electrode, the rapid loss of catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) is observed within a few voltammetric evaluation cycles. Online differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy (DEMS) and in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) revealed that the catalytic activity loss is mainly due to the formation of poisonous carbon monoxide (CO) and its subsequent strong adsorption on the catalytic Pt sites. CO coverage on the Pt surface becomes almost saturated within just 50 cycles of HER polarization measurements. The resultant underestimation of activity is effectively avoidable by physically separating the graphite counter electrode from the analyte in an H-type cell. Consequently, our findings highlight that, similar to Pt counter electrodes, graphite counter electrodes must be carefully applied to eliminate any experimental artifacts originating from CO evolved during electrocatalytic reactions.									12	0	0	0	3	0	12			2155-5435			WOS:000574920200045

The composition and structure of catalysts were characterized, and the electrocatalytic performance of the nanofiber catalysts in water electrolysis was investigated from various aspects such as overpotential, charge transfer resistance, and exchange current density. Special attention was paid on the effect of Pt/Ir ratio on the electrocatalytic activity of the electrospun nanofibers. The results showed that the Pt-IrO2 nanofiber catalysts with average fiber diameters ranging from 10 to 100 nm can be successfully obtained by the electrospinning method, and the average diameter decreased with the increase of Pt content. Since a bigger amount of IrO2 content and a thinner fiber structure are all beneficial to the electrocatalytic performance, the Pt-IrO2 catalysts with Pt:Ir = 1:9 and Pt:Ir = 9:1 both showed better catalytic performance for OER than the commercial IrO2, which was also demonstrated by the lower charge transfer resistance and higher exchange current density. As a result, the overpotentials of Pt-IrO2 catalysts with Pt:Ir = 1:9 and Pt:Ir = 9:1 are 50 mV and 32 mV lower than the overpotential of the commercial IrO2 at 30 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The electrospun Pt-IrO2 nanofiber catalyst with proper Pt content seems to be very promising since it can not only improve the catalytic performance and the safety of PEM electrolysis cells, but also reduce the amount of more expensive Ir in catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000588111000001

Three groups of catalysts have been prepared: (i) CuxCo3-xO4 by thermal decomposition of mixed nitrate and carbonate precursors; (ii) thin films of Co-Ni-Te-O and Co-Te-O were deposited by vacuum co-evaporation of Co, Ni and TeO2 and (iii) CoxOv/ZrO2 films were obtained by electrochemical deposition.The electrochemical behavior of the chemically synthesized catalysts was studied on classical bilayered gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), where the catalyst is in form of powder. The GDE catalyzed with vacuum deposited catalysts was prepared by direct deposition of the catalyst on gas-supplying layer, thus creating a ready-to-use gas diffusion electrode. Catalysts prepared electrochemically were first deposited on Ni foam and than pressed onto the gas-supplying layer.Different catalysts deposited on classical and originally designed GDEs were compared by their electrochemical performances. Cu0.3Co2.7O4 deposited on a classical bilayered GDE with loading of 50 mg cm(-2) exhibits stable current-voltage characteristics after 200 charge-discharge cycles in a real metal hydride-air battery. The electrochemically and vacuum deposited CoxOv/ZrO2, Co-Ni-Te-O and Co-Te-O films exhibit much higher mass activity compared to Cu0.2Co2.8O4 for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. The difference is that the loading of electrochemically and vacuum deposited films is 0.06 mg cm(-2) only, which is a substantial advantage from a practical viewpoint. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we provided a facile method to synthesize Ir-Sn binary oxides in the form of a nanorod assembly with a large number of pores and a lower Ir content as efficient catalysts for the OER. The deep eutectic solvent formed by glucose and urea plays a crucial role in the synthesis. When heating the deep eutectic solution containing IrCl3 and SnCl2 at 180 degrees C, the polymerization and the following expansion of glucose produces a bread-like porous foam with embedded Ir and Sn metal ions. During the following calcination process in Ar and air, the sintering of the catalyst is inhibited owing to the blocking effect of the glucose-derived carbonaceous material, and the removal of the carbonaceous species produces pores in the final product. The -NH2 groups in urea can form complexes with the Ir and Sn metal ions, which is beneficial to to obtain the formation of an Ir-Sn binary oxide with uniform composition. As a result, an Ir-Sn oxide with an Ir/Sn molar ratio at 2/1 presents the best catalytic activity for the OER among the Ir-Sn oxides, which is almost identical to that of a mono-Ir oxide. The method in this work provided a pathway to fabricate high-performance OER catalysts with low Ir content.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1452-3981			WOS:000430452300005

In the present study, we designed a new type of bifunctional catalyst by embedding cobalt sulfide hollow nanospheres in nitrogen and sulfur co-doped graphene nanoholes (Co1-xS/N-S-G) via a simple, one-pot pyrolysis method. The catalyst had a high specific surface area (390.6 m(2) g(-1)) with a hierarchical meso-macroporous structure. In an alkaline medium, the catalyst exhibited high ORR catalytic activity, with a half-wave potential 30 mV more positive and a diffusion-limiting current density 15% higher than a commercial Pt/C catalyst, and the catalyst is also highly active for OER with a small overpotential of 371 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) current density. Its overall oxygen electrode activity parameter (Delta E) is 0.760 V, which is smaller than that of Pt/C and most of the non-precious metal catalysts in previous studies. Furthermore, it demonstrated better durability towards both the ORR and OER. Detailed investigation clarified that the material's excellent electrocatalytic performance is attributable to: (1) a synergistic effect, induced by the presence of multiple types of active sites, including cobalt sulfide hollow nanospheres, nitrogen and sulfur dopants, and possible Co-N-C sites; (2) cobalt sulfide hollow nanospheres penetrating through the plane of graphene sheets form strong interaction between them; (3) more edge defects associated with the existence of nanoholes on the graphene basal plane; and (4) the high surface area and efficient mass transfer arising from the hierarchical porous structure.									79	5	0	0	4	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000403664800041

This review summarizes recent progress in this area of research, where the catalytic performance is evaluated within the context of stabilization of metal nanoparticles against sintering/aggregation and metal-substrate interactions that manipulate the electronic properties of metal nanoparticles and hence the bonding interactions with reaction intermediates. Also discussed are the latest breakthroughs of heteroatom-doped graphene derivatives as effective metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction. In addition, the review includes a perspective on the development of effective ORR catalysts with a focus on a further understanding of the ORR mechanism as well as on other two-dimensional layered nanostructures such as MoS2 that have been observed to exhibit electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction. Leading mechanistic models are discussed to account for the electrocatalytic activity. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry									21	0	0	0	2	0	21			0268-2575	1097-4660		WOS:000363477400003

A prime example for this is the hydrogen evolution/oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) over metal catalysts. While it has long been established that alkaline conditions result in a more sluggish reaction kinetics than in acidic conditions, the underlying reason for this trend remains contentious. We apply density functional calculations to evaluate prevailing hypotheses for the origin of this effect: shifts in hydrogen binding, proton donor, and water reorganization energy. We present a microkinetic model, based on ab initio reaction energetics of all possible elementary steps. Our model shows a good agreement with experimental trends. We find that with increasing pH, the proton donor changes from hydronium to water. Our model suggests that the intrinsically larger barriers for the splitting of water with respect to hydronium are the cause of HER kinetics being slower in alkaline than in acidic media.									70	2	0	0	4	0	70			2155-5435			WOS:000474812400040

However, TiC is intrinsically reactive to oxygen under ambient conditions, and its stability is completely determined by the surface overlayer. Herein, the catalytic effects of oxide overlayer (TiO) on adsorption mechanism, reaction path, and growth morphology of lithium oxides were comprehensively elucidated using periodic density functional theory calculations. The results indicate that the TiO overlayer on the surface of TiC(100)-TiO enhances the adsorption of lithium oxides. As compared to the disproportionation reaction, the lithiation reaction is the primary contributor to the formation of Li2O2 and Li2O on TiC(100) surface. Interestingly, the oxidized TiC(100)-TiO performs better in inhibiting the generation of undesirable Li2O. Analysis demonstrates that the discharge performance is not only related to the widely known morphology and size of product but also to the adsorption of (Li2O2)n clusters on the TiC(100) surface. The electronic structures of (Li2O2)n clusters on TiC(100)-TiC and TiC(100)-TiO surfaces have been examined to study the influence of TiO overlayer on the conductivity of accumulated products, which helps explain the innovative discovery of the experiment that TiC has excellent performance in improving the cycle ability of lithium-oxygen batteries. Our results promote the understanding of the ORR mechanism on TiC surface and provide theoretical guidance for the design of efficient and stable air cathodes for lithium-oxygen batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691184400003

Herein, we present ultrathin oxygen-doped FePSe3 (FePSe3-O) nanosheets by Ar/O-2 plasma treatment, with remarkable surface atom reorganization. Such surface atom reorganization generates multiple crystalline-amorphous interfaces that benefit the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction, achieving a low overpotential of only 261 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a small Tafel slope of 41.13 mV dec(-1). Density functional theory calculation indicates that oxygen doping can also modulate the electrical states at the Fermi level with a decreased band gap responsible for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Such unique FePSe3-O nanosheets can be further fabricated as the air cathode in rechargeable liquid zinc-air batteries (ZABs), which deliver a high open circuit potential of 1.47 V, a small charge-discharge voltage gap of 0.80 V, and good cycling stability for more than 800 circles. As a proof of concept, the flexible solid-state ZABs assembled with FePSe3-O nanosheets as cathode also display a favorable charge-discharge performance, durable stability, and good bendability. This work sheds new insights into the rational design of defect-rich ternary thiophosphate nanosheets by plasma treatment toward enhanced oxygen electrocatalysts in metal-air batteries.									16	1	0	0	2	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000546698600048	32490656

Herein, a core-shell heterogeneous structure (NF/NiSe@Fe2O3) is fabricated via two-step hydrothermal method, which exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV (or 282 mV) at 10 mA/cm(2) (or 200 mA/cm(2)), a small Tafel slope of 36.9 mV/dec, and long-term stability (-230 h) in 1 mol/L KOH for OER. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveal the (oxy)hydroxide-rich surface and strong coupling interface between NiSe and Fe2O3 via the Fe-Se bond. Density functional theory calculation suggests that the d-band center and electronic state of NiSe@Fe2O3 heterojunction are well optimized due to the formation of Fe-Se bond, which is favorable for the enhanced OER activity because of the easy adsorption of oxygen-containing intermediates and desorption of O-2 in the OER process. In addition, the unique core-shell structure and robust bonding interface are responsible for the good stability for OER.

Herein, in-situ vertically grown bimetallic phosphide nanosheets containing abundant Cu3P/Ni2P heterogeneous interfaces are successfully synthesized on Cu foam (marked as Cu3P/Ni2P@CF) as the bifunctional electrocatalyst for both HER and OER. Owing to the synergistic effects of electronic regulation of heterojunction and the hierarchical array structure on 3D substrate, the Cu3P/Ni2P@CF integrated electrode displays the overpotential of 330 mV @ 50 mA cm(-2) for OER and 88.1 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2) for HER in 1 M KOH. Interestingly, the catalyst -based water electrolyzer only demands a low cell voltage of 1.56 V@10 mA cm(-2), exceeding the integrated Pt/C + IrO2 counterpart. Density functional theory (DFT) results further disclose that the charge rearrangement of heterogeneous interface can not only endow the hydrogen binding energy (delta G(*H)) approach to zero, but also boost the H2O dissociation and *OH desorption via multi-site synergy for HER. This work provides a valuable approach to construct advanced materials towards overall water splitting.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000822983000001

Inspired by this, we propose an efficient Z-scheme system comprised of 2D MnO2/Monolayer g-C3N4 with defective Mn3+ active sites to realize overall water splitting. These defective Mn3+ active sites might boost H2O adsorption and optimize the interfacial charge separation/transfer in the photocatalytic process by introducing the Mn3+/Mn4+ redox couple. As a result, the composite displays an excellent and stable H-2 and O-2 evolution rates of 60.6 and 28.9 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. Meanwhile, the H-2 evolution rate is up to 28.0 mmol g(-1) h(-1) with apparent quantum efficiency of 23.33% at 420 nm in the H-2 evolution half reaction. This study provides a new opportunity for constructing a Z-scheme overall water splitting system by exploiting the redox reactions of other metal cation vacancies.									188	12	0	0	20	0	190			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000449444000047

In this work, 2D nanosheets decorated with a 3D porous nanostructure, including Fe, Co and Ni elements, are developed via anodic cyclic voltammetry scanning (ACVs) in the presence of sodium sulfide (FeCoNi-NS-ACVs). The formed 2D nanosheets provide metal ions during ACVs to generate a 3D porous structure and also construct a hierarchical morphology to favor the transport of the electrolyte and release of produced gas bubbles. What's more, the developed FeCoNi-NS-ACVs possesses superhydrophilic and excellent electroconductivity properties. Benefiting from the above merits, FeCoNi-NS-ACVs exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances for the OER with low overpotentials of 170 mV and 198 mV to drive 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 64 mV dec(-1) and remarkable durability over 50 h.

The molecular Ni sites on graphene were redox-active. However, they showed poor activity toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in KOH aqueous solution. We demonstrated for the first time that the presence of Fe3+ ions in the solution could bond at the vicinity of the Ni sites with a distance of 2.7 angstrom, generating molecularly sized and heterogeneous Ni-Fe sites anchored on doped graphene. These Ni-Fe sites exhibited markedly improved OER activity. The Pourbaix diagram confirmed the formation of the Ni-Fe sites and revealed that the Ni-Fe sites adsorbed HO- ions with a bridge geometry, which facilitated the OER electrocatalysis.									97	5	0	0	4	0	97			2375-2548			WOS:000427892700023	29536041

Polarization properties of IrOx/M-SnO2 catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) were examined at 80 degrees C in both 0.1 M HClO4 solution (half cell) and a single cell with a Nafion (R) membrane (thickness = 50 mu m). While all catalysts exhibited similar OER activities in the half cell, the cell potential (E ceii ) of the single cell was found to decrease with the increasing apparent conductivities ((sigma(app, catalyst)) of these catalysts: an E-cell of 1.61 V (voltage efficiency of 92%) at 1 A cm(-2) was achieved in a single cell by the use of an IrOx/Sb-SnO2 anode (highest (Tapp, catalyst) with a low Ir-metal loading of 0.11 mg cm(-2) and Pt supported on graphitized carbon black (Pt/GCB) as the cathode with 0.35 mg cm(-2) of Pt loading. In addition to the reduction of the ohmic loss in the anode catalyst layer, the increased electronic conductivity contributed to decreasing the OER overpotential due to the effective utilization of the IrOx nanocatalysts on the M-SnO2 supports, which is an essential factor in improving the performance with low noble metal loadings.									24	0	0	0	1	0	24				2073-4344		WOS:000459732000073

The diffusing species were shown to be oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte solution and the peroxide ion generated at the electrode by the electrochemical reaction. The electrode deterioration occurring during anodic oxygen evolution was also studied using impedance analysis. The degradation, mainly carbon corrosion, resulted in a loss of electrochemically active surface area of the electrode. High catalyst loadings improved the electrode stability.

Bimetallic nanosystems with highly tunable electronic, structural, and catalytic properties that depend on their composition, structure, and size have attracted considerable attention. Herein, we report the synthesis of bimetallic nickel-copper (NiCu) alloy nanoparticles confined in a sp(2) carbon framework that exhibits trifunctional catalytic properties toward hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions. The electrocatalytic functions of the NiCu nanoalloys were experimentally and theoretically correlated with the composition-dependent local structural distortion of the bimetallic lattice at the nanoparticle surfaces. Our study demonstrated a downshift of the d-band of the catalysts that adjusts the binding energies of the intermediate catalytic species. XPS analysis revealed that the binding energy for Ni 2p(3/2) band of the Ni0.25Cu0.75/C nanoparticles was shifted similar to 3 times compared to other bimetallic systems, and this was correlated to the high electrocatalytic activity observed. Interestingly, the bimetallic Ni0.25Cu0.75/C catalyst surpassed the OER performance of RuO2 benchmark catalyst exhibiting a small onset potential of 1.44 V vs RHE and an overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) as well as the electrochemical long-term stability of commercial RuO2 and Pt catalysts and kept at least 90% of the initial current applied after 20 000 s for the OER/ORR/HER reactions. This study reveals significant insight about the structure- function relationship for non-noble bimetallic nanostructures with multifunctional electrocatalytic properties.									137	2	0	0	8	0	138			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000566667700031	32786805

In aqueous solutions hypochlorous acid may decompose into oxygen or chlorate. Using density functional theory (DFT) modelling we have for the first time established detailed mechanisms for the respective decomposition pathways. Our calculations indicate, that both oxygen and chlorate formation proceed through an identical set of intermediates. At neutral pH the reaction is initiated by a fast equilibrium between HOCl, OCl-, Cl2O and Cl3O2-. The subsequent abstraction of Cl- to form Cl2O2 is rate determining for chlorate formation while it is the decomposition of Cl2O2 in the case of oxygen formation. Under alkaline conditions, OCl- decomposition to chlorate proceeds through chlorite. This reaction path is significantly less active. The highest rate for chlorate or oxygen formation is found at pH 7.1. These results highlight the need to consider a complex mixture of different Cl species when addressing the chemistry of hypochlorous acid containing solutions.									13	0	0	0	4	0	13			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000486175400046	31453585

Chemiluminescence has been observed from the electronically excited states of SO2 and CH in thiophene+O(3P); NO, CH, CN and NO2 in pyrrole+O(3P) and OH in furan+O(3P) and the evolution of its intensity has been monitored as a function of reactant concentration. Kinetic determinations have been done for the reaction of O(3P) and thiophene by following the SO*2 emission intensity and the O(3P) decay, using the titration of residual oxygen atoms with NO, at several temperatures, and for the reaction of O(3P) and pyrrole at 318K by following the decay of O(3P) with NO. For the thiophene reaction, rate constants in the range T=379-525K can be fitted to an Arrhenius expression. Different reaction mechanisms are proposed in the light of the observed emissions and the empirical correlation existing between the kinetic parameters and the ionization potential of the aromatic hydrocarbons. A comparison is made with the reactions of O(3P) and benzene and O(3P) and pyridine.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0300-9238			INSPEC:2601731

Carbon-based electrocatalysts (CBEs) show great potential for practical H2O2 synthesis. However, their complex structures make it challenging to determine the nature of active sites and to precisely control them. Herein, we show that precise modulation of the chemistry and structures of holey graphene with edge sites enriched by oxygen-containing functional groups can facilitate 2e(-) ORR. These combined functionalities could improve ORR performance under various pH conditions, for example, resulting in an average of 95% H2O2 selectivity, similar to 97% Faraday efficiency, high productivity of 2360 mol kg(cat)(-1) h(-1) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations on the oxygen functional groups at the edge sites revealed the most active site for 2e(-) ORR is a synergy between ether (C-O-C) and carbonyl (C=O) functional groups with nearly zero overpotential.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2567-3173		WOS:000847542300001

In this work, perovskite Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3-delta nanorods are synthesized by an electrospinning method. The performance of the Li-O-2 cell with Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3-delta catalysts is better than that of the cell only with Super-P. Furthermore, modification of CoO nanoparticles on the cathode can provide an obviously improved electrochemical performance with a reduced voltage gap (-80-140 mV), which is ascribed to the superior catalytic activity of CoO nanoparticles toward OER. All of these results demonstrate that the perovskite Sr0.9Y0.1CoO3-delta is an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for lithium-oxygen batteries, and the incorporation of CoO nanoparticles is an effective approach for improving the cathode performance as well.									14	1	0	0	0	0	15			2574-0962			WOS:000458706600050

The evaluation of the hole reactivity was addressed by direct comparison to photoelectrodes based on pristine TiO2. The visible-light generated holes in TiO2-PH are located in the thin polyheptazine ("graphitic carbon nitride") layer at the surface of TiO2 and possess a lower oxidation potential (by similar to 0.9 V) as compared to UV light-photogenerated holes in pristine TiO2. Due to their slow water oxidation kinetics, the photoholes accumulate at the surface, which leads to negligible oxygen evolution and increased recombination. This problem can be overcome by introducing a suitable co-catalyst (IrO2 nanoparticles), as evidenced by dioxygen evolution under visible light (lambda > 420 nm) irradiation.

The optimized Fe doping density, vertically grown nanoneedle structure without any binder on the conductive substrate, and abundant surface-active sites make the Fe-doped Ni3S2 an efficient catalyst for both electrochemical reactions. The as-synthesized Fe-doped Ni3S2 nanoneedles on NF show an outstanding electrocatalytic performance, only requiring an overpotential of 269 and 314 mV to provide 100 and -100 mA cm(-2) for OER and HER, respectively. A water electrolyzer, assembled with the Fe-doped Ni3S2 as both the anode and cathode, displays an exceptionally low onset potential of 1.39 V and achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a very low cell voltage of 1.58 V with excellent long-term stability for 50 h.

As one of the ultimate clean energy sources, hydrogen (H-2) energy produced by water splitting using electricity from solar radiation, wind, tide, and nuclear fusion, among other sources, has attracted more and more public attention since the late 18th century. Although noble-metal based electrocatalysts perform well, they suffer severely from the high cost and rarity from the viewpoint of practical applications. Recently, various kinds of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts based on low cost and earth-abundant transition metals have been developed for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen (O-2) evolution reaction (OER). Among them, non-noble-metal bifunctional electrocatalysts (NHOBEs), showing high performances in both HER and OER, are therefore of great significance and importance in future applications. With NHOBEs, one will be able to significantly simplify the fabrication procedures of electrolyzers, and more importantly, elevate the efficiency of "all in one" electrocatalytic water-splitting systems, which will greatly favor their industrial applications by demanding substantially lowered the production costs. While the laws of NHOBEs from the same main group anionic elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and boron families have not been well-reported so far. Herein, the recent significant progresses of NHOBEs classified by different main group anionic elements are summarized, and emphases are placed to the designs, syntheses, electrocatalytic performances in water-splitting, and future possible applications of NHOBEs. Moreover, the prospects of a number of vigorously investigated NHOBE catalysts and the possible trends of future developments are also evaluated. In addition, current challenges facing research with respect to electrocatalysts for water-splitting are discussed.									163	9	0	0	4	0	164			2155-5435			WOS:000430154100112

The content of Fe in FexCo1-xOOH, no more than 1/3 of Co, can be controlled by adjusting the insitu anodic oxidation time.

As such, electrocatalysis is employed to facilitate the ORR and OER. Despite enormous efforts, real time imaging of the electrocatalysis during the ORR and OER processes remain elusive. Furthermore, it is controversial whether or not electrocatalysis is necessary in the Na-O-2 battery. Here we show the first in-situ imaging of the operation of the electrocatalysis in a Na-O-2 battery in an advanced aberration corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM). In the Au-coated MnO2 nanowire air cathode, the ORR is characterized by the formation of NaO2 nano bubbles nucleated from the Au catalysts, causing an 18 times volume increase on the surface of the MnO2 nanowires; the NaO2 quickly disproportionated to Na2O2 and O-2, causing collapse of the NaO2 nano bubbles. In contrast, no ORR took place in the bare MnO2 nanowire cathode; instead, the MnO2 nanowires only swelled 217% as a result of the Na+ intercalation. The results provide not only new insight into the Au-catalyzed oxygen chemistry in the Na-O-2 battery, but also an atom-level characterization technique to evaluate the electrocatalysis in the metal air batteries.									27	2	0	0	0	0	28			2405-8297			WOS:000469207500006

Herein, a heterostructure of CoNiP and NiFe layered double hydroxides (CoNiP@NiFe LDHs) is successfully prepared via a quick two-step electrode-position method. The electrons rearrangement at the interface composed of CoNiP and NiFe LDHs promoted by the disparity of their unique work functions can increase the electron density of CoNiP, further optimizing the Gibbs free energy for the adsorption of hydrogen. Thus, CoNiP@NiFe LDHs need a low overpotential of 68 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2). Meanwhile, the modulated valence band energy level (E-VB) and holes collection at the space charge region of NiFe LDHs layer significantly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction performance of CoNiP@NiFe LDHs, which presents a low overpotential of 255 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). The assembled electrolyzer using CoNiP@NiFe LDHs as electrodes also exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.59 V at 50 mA cm(-2). (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The as-synthesized rod-arrays exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance and favorable stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under an alkaline atmosphere (overpotential of 240.5 mV under 100 mA cm(-2)). After doping P into Mo and Co-based oxidized (S450) nanorods, excellent composites were developed for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential of 162.8 mV under 100 mA cm(-2). Thus, an asymmetric setup composed of Mo and Co-based oxidized/phosphide (P-S450) nanorods and P-S450@FeOOH electrodes were constructed for overall seawater splitting, which delivered a potential of 1.828 V at 300 mA cm(-2) in alkaline simulated seawater (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl).

The catalyst also exhibited excellent performance for overall water splitting as both anodic and cathodic catalysts in alkaline media. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the synergy between CoP and N dopants leads to higher catalytic activities for HER and OER and the C atoms between N atoms in the carbon layer are the catalytically active sites for the HER.									42	2	0	0	1	0	42			2168-0485			WOS:000492117200054

However, the reaction is limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the catalytic field. In order to overcome the limitation in OER catalyst activity, this paper attempts to synthesize and develop a series of three-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) electrocatalytic materials. The structure and morphology of bimetallic cobalt and nickel MOFs are characterized by FT-IR, Raman, SEM, TEM, and XPS. It is found that the bimetallic cobalt and nickel MOFs have a columnar micro-structure assembled by nanosheets. Further in-situ growth on the iron (Fe) foam to prepare an integrated nanoarray self-supported electrode did not significant change their micro-structure. The obtained bimetal electrocatalysts exhibit significantly enhanced OER activity as compared to the single-metal MOFs counterpart. The cobalt and nickel double-doped materials in-situ grown on Fe foam exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity and remarkable durability with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 0.1 M KOH solution (with the overpotential of 264 mV and the Tafel slope of 54.3 mV dec(-1)). There is a significant improvement compared with the material on the glassy carbon electrode. The introduction of the bimetal species (Co and Ni) into the ordered MOFs provides a synergistic effect of the active centers resulting in an enhanced electron transfer and improved electrochemical performance. This work enriches the MOFs electrocatalytic electrode and pave the way for their practical applications.									18	1	0	0	2	0	18			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000480847500001

The CoxFe3-xO4 thin film electrode can be fabricated in minutes or even tens of seconds. The Co-doping concentration, thickness, and orientation of the CoxFe3-xO4 films can be simply controlled by varying the deposition potential, deposition time, and the substrate, respectively. The dependences of the catalytic activity of the CoxFe3-xO4 films on the composition, thickness, and orientation of growth are explored. The CoxFe3-xO4 films exhibit greatly enhanced catalytic activities toward the OER compared to the Fe3O4 thin film. The polycrystalline CoxFe3-xO4 film deposited at 0.88 V-Ag/AgCl for 150 seconds exhibits the highest catalytic activity with an overpotential of 0.42 Vat a current density of 10 mA cm (2), a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec (1), and an exchange current density of about 2.39 x 10 (10) A cm (2), which are comparable to those of Co3O4. Besides, the CoxFe3-xO4 films possess good stability during the long-term electrolysis at a current density of 10 mA cm (2) in 1 M NaOH. The satisfactory catalytic activity and stability combined with the simplicity of fabrication make the electrodeposited CoxFe3-xO4 films economically and environmentally preferable compared to Co3O4 as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction.

Here we introduce a recyclable redox mediator (silicotungstic acid) that enables the coupling of low-pressure production of oxygen via water oxidation to a separate, catalytic hydrogen production step outside the electrolyzer that requires no post-electrolysis energy input. This approach sidesteps the production of high-pressure gases inside the electrolytic cell (a major cause of membrane degradation) and essentially eliminates the hazardous issue of product gas crossover at the low current densities that characterize renewables-driven water-splitting devices. We demonstrated that a platinum-catalyzed system can produce pure hydrogen over 30 times faster than state-of-the-art proton exchange membrane electrolyzers at equivalent platinum loading.									416	20	0	0	40	0	431			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000341483800059	25214625

However, spatial heterogeneities of charge transfer sites and catalytic sites at the electrode/electrolyte interface obscures the surface reaction process. Herein, we quantified the relationship between the local catalytic current of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the surface charge density using operando spatially resolved photovoltage microscopy on the Pt/Ti array on the p-Si photoelectrode. We found that the Pt/Ti islands on the p-Si surface worked as the main charge collect areas but as the sole catalytic sites to drive the PEC hydrogen evolution. Based on the achievements of identifying the local photocurrent and photovoltage on a single Pt/Ti island, we found that the local HER current can be linearly regulated by the charge density at reactive sites by concurrently adjusting the bias potential and the spacings of the Pt/Ti islands. These results emphasize the significant impact of the surface charge density on the catalytic activity in photoelectrochemistry.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000719783300017	34726399

However, it is still challenging to develop facile and efficient method to construct Pt-based NFs with tailored structures. Herein, a simple solvothermal method was developed to prepare monodisperse PtCu dodecahedral nanoframes (PtCu DNFs), where cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) served as the structure-director and dispersing agent, oleylamine as reductant, allantoin as the co-structure-director and coreductant. The PtCu DNFs displayed remarkably improved catalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acid and alkaline electrolytes relative to homemade PtCu nanopolyhedrons (NPHs), commercial Pt/C (20 wt%) and Pt black catalysts. The work offers some instructive guidelines for synthesis of novel metallic NFs as efficient HER catalysts.									28	2	0	0	1	0	28			2574-0962			WOS:000458706500073

However, the sluggish reaction kinetics of HER and ORR required efficient electrocatalyst such as Pt to promote such process. Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) exhibit great potential to replace noble metal electrocatalysts to accelerate HER and ORR due to their high activity and easy availability. Herein, a highly-efficient bifunctional CoP electrocatalyst for HER and ORR, featuring a unique core-shell structure decorated on nitrogen-doped carbon matrix was designed and constructed via etching a cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) with phytic acid (PA) followed by pyrolysis treatment (PA-ZIF-67-900). Experimental results revealed that the pure-phase single-crystalline CoP exhibited outstanding electrocatalytic performance in HER and ORR, superior to Co(PO3)(2) in PA-ZIF-67-700, hybrid phase of Co(PO3)(2) and CoP in PA-ZIF-67-800 and Co2P-doped CoP in PA-ZIF-67-1000. To reach the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) the as-synthesized CoP required an overpotential of 120 mV for HER in 1 mol/L KOH and half-wave potential of 0.85 V in O-2-saturated 0.1 mol/L KOH.

We observe a sequential quenching of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic moment. For minute exposures to oxygen this leads to an enhancement of the maximum susceptibility of up to 66% for chi". We show that the reason for the reduction of the anisotropy before the one of the moment is due to preferential oxygen adsorption at the island edges, which are the main source of magnetic anisotropy. Our example shows how the enhanced chemical reactivity, combined with the enhanced anisotropy of low coordinated atoms, leads to surprising changes of magnetic properties upon exposure to oxygen.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000223922500065

In this article, porous Fe-N-codoped materials are obtained by pyrolysis of a defined precursor of polydopamine-coated Fe3O4 as not only template but also nitrogen and iron source. In 0.1 M KOH, the as-prepared catalyst exhibited high ORR activity (onset potential of 0.949 V and half-wave potential of 0.836 V vs. RHE), with excellent electrochemical stability, durability and remarkable tolerance toward methanol.

In this report, we show the results that astonished us. Co hydroxide containing trivalent V was prepared chemically and screened for electrochemical water oxidation in rigorously Fe free 1 M KOH (pH 13.8). Overpotential of 198 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was observed for the synthesized Co-V hydroxide with the optimal Tafel slope of 60 mV dec(-1). This is the lowest overpotential at this current density ever reported for OER in alkaline conditions while utilizing Co based electrocatalysts. Density function theory (DFT) calculations showed that the third elementary step (oxyhydroxide formation and delivery of O-2) was spontaneous on V site that is bridging two adjacent Co sites which was attributed to the observed enhancement.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000506719300076	31815442

However, their scarcity has led to the emergence of carbon-based materials which are exceptionally promising alternatives for the HER. Herein, graphene capsules-decorated boron-carbon-nitride sheets are developed by pyrolyzing a mixture of pyridine borane and custom-made GCs. The 3D hollow GCs effectively increase the surface area to supplement more exposed active sites for the hydrogen adsorption/desorption reaction. The carbon-rich ternary hybrid structure favors adjusting the electrical conductivity, which provides better HER catalytic performances (overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) in acidic conditions. The long-term stability for 24 h and the simplest designing technique propose an effective metal-free electrocatalyst for commercial applications in the renewable energy field.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			2574-0962			WOS:000644737800092

In this paper, dandelion-like NiCo2O4 hollow microspheres are prepared through a simple self-assembled hydrothermal process as cathode catalyst. The assembled LABs show relative high discharge potential in different oxygen partial pressure, and can deliver a reversible capacity of 8019 mAh.g(-1) at the current density of 300 mA.g(-1) with stable cycle performance for at least 40 times in ambient air. The excellent performance of NiCo2O4 cathode can be attributed to the dandelion hollow structure, together with the abundant oxygen vacancies, which would enhance the ORR and OER process. The study confirms the feasibility of dandelion-like NiCo2O4 hollow spheres as efficient cathode for the LABs in ambient air. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, the three-dimensional hierarchical morphology of CTO NA also contributes to fast charge transfer and greatly enhanced mass transport in electrochemical reaction.

Iodoethane adsorbs dissociatively at 150 K to produce surface ethyl groups on both clean and oxygen-covered Ag(110) surfaces. The ethyl species couple to form butane on both surfaces, with the desorption peak maximum located between 218 and 238 K, depending on the ethyl coverage. In addition to butane, a number of oxidation products including diethyl ether, ethanol, acetaldehyde, surface acetate, ethylene, carbon dioxide and water were formed on the oxygen-dosed AE(110) surface. Diethyl ether was the major oxygenate produced at all ethyl:oxygen ratios, and the peak temperature for ether evolution varied from 220 to 266 K depending on the relative coverages of these reactants. The total combustion products, CO(2) and H(2)O were primarily formed at low ethyl coverages in the presence of excess oxygen. The formation of ethylene near 240 K probably involves an oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation pathway since ethylene is not formed from ethyl groups on the clean surface. Acetaldehyde and ethanol evolve coincidentally with a peak centered at 270-280 K, and are attributed to the reactions of surface ethoxide species. The surface acetate which decomposes near 620 K is formed from subsequent reactions of acetaldehyde with oxygen atoms. The addition of ethyl to oxygen to form surface ethoxides was verified by HREELS results. The yields of all products exhibited a strong dependence on the relative coverages of ethyl and oxygen.

Many of these factors are difficult to evaluate for natural systems. A combination of textural modeling and stable isotope analysis allows for a distinction between several possible reaction paths for olivine growth in a silliceous dolomite contact aureole. It is suggested that ollivine forms directly from dolomite and quartz. The formation of olivine from this metastable reaction implies metamorphic crystallization far from equilibrium. Stable and metastable reaction paths predict e textures observed (calcite haloes around bladed olivine crystals) well. It is possible to discriminate between individual reaction paths only on the basis of the oxygen isotope compositions of the minerals involved. Products were found to be in stable isotope equilibrium, but in disequillibrium with the reactants. Only the metastable overall reaction dolomite + quartz --> olivine + calcite + CO2 produces no dolomite by local reactions, and hence agrees with the oxygen isotope data. Thus, significant mineral growth occurred far from equilibrium with respect to the thermodynamically stable reactions of the system. This amazing finding implies that metamorphism of contact aureoles has to be reinterpreted in a more complex, dynamic fashion, involving metastable reactions and metastable equilibria as well. The spatial distribution of metamorphic mineral assemblages in a contact aureole cannot be interpreted as a proxy for the temporal evolution of a single rock specimen, because each rock undergoes a different reaction path, depending on temperature, heating rate, and fluid-infiltration rate.									36	0	0	0	1	0	36			0091-7613	1943-2682		WOS:000223696500022

This composite surface was examined by cyclic voltammetry in both acidic and alkaline solutions, in the potential region of both hydrogen and oxygen underpotential deposition. The charge related to hydrogen underpotential deposition corresponded to a surface roughness of 43. As a consequence of high surface roughness, the diffusion current of oxygen reduction in an oxygen saturated 0.1 M NaOH solution, measured by voltarnmetry on rotating disc electrode, was found to be comparable to the current of hydrogen underpotential deposition.					7th Conference of the Yugoslav-Materials-Research-Society (Yu-MRS)7th Conference of the Yugoslav-Materials-Research-Society (Yu-MRS)	SEP 12-16, 2005SEP 12-16, 2005	Yugoslav Mat Res SocYugoslav Mat Res Soc	Herceg Novi, SERBIA MONTENEGHerceg Novi, SERBIA MONTENEG	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0255-5476		*************	WOS:000239351800044

In this study, high OER performance is achieved using novel hierarchical ZnxCo3-xO4 nanostructures constructed with small secondary nanoneedles grown on primary rhombus-shaped pillar arrays. The nanostructures have large roughness factor, high porosity, and high active-site density. Only a small overpotential of similar to 0.32 V is needed for a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 51 mV/decade. The nanostructures are also found to perform significantly better than pure Co3O4 and a commercial Ir/C catalyst and to perform similarly to the best OER catalysts that have been reported for alkaline media. These merits combined with the satisfactory stability of the nanostructures indicate that they are promising electrodes for water oxidation.									369	13	0	0	16	0	372			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000332913400017

Amorphous CoPx-CoOy composites with interconnected porous structures were constructed through low-temperature phosphating of cobalt oxides. Moreover, low-temperature phosphating of cobalt oxide and other metal oxides with different morphologies also produced the same porous structures, further proving the generality of this method. Interestingly, the prepared CoPx-CoOy catalyst has excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reactions in alkaline media. At a current density of 10 mA cm-2, an overpotential of 322 mV and a Tafel slope of 102 mV dec-1 are generated. In a 1 M KOH electrolyte, its electrochemical activity is significantly better than that of unphosphorylated Co3O4. Under catalytic conditions, the excellent performance arises from the formation of the incorporation of phosphorus, amorphous phase and porous structures. The unique structure can provide a large number of active sites, significantly shortening the electron transfer pathway. This is the foundation of our research on the development of electrocatalysts with rich active sites. The synthesis of amorphous interconnected porous structures by introducing phosphorus will allow the application of high-efficiency catalysts in electrocatalysis and other important chemical reactions.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000661105400014

As a result, an uncertain amount of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs, making it difficult to maximize the catalytic efficiency. Herein, sulfuration is used to boost the activity of FexC/Fe, forming an improved system, "FeNC-S-FexC/Fe", for catalysis involving oxygen. Various spectroscopic techniques are used to define the composition of the active sites, which include Fe-S bonds at the interface of the now-S-doped carbon matrix and the FexC/Fe clusters. In addition to outstanding activity in basic media, FeNC-S-FexC/Fe exhibits improved ORR activity and durability in acidic media; its half-wave potential of 0.821 V outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst (20%), and its activity does not decay even after 10 000 cycles. Interestingly, the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) simultaneously improves. Thus, FeNC-S-FexC/Fe can be used as a high-performance bifunctional catalyst in Zn-air batteries. Theoretical calculations and control experiments show that the original FeNx active centers are enhanced by the FexC/Fe clusters and the Fe-S and C-S-C bonds.									181	19	0	0	12	0	184			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000453355300018	30302828

More importantly, such PdAu HCs possess periodic concave structures that boost ORR performance. These structures readily form high-density high-index facets, and fewer arc edges. Concave structures can deliver strong strain effects and surface charge accumulation is revealed by off-axis electron holography. In addition, periodic concave structures can provide strong localized surface-plasmon coupling, which means that PdAu HCs have great potential as efficient surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. This study offers a novel and general approach for the design of complex noble metal-based nanostructures as efficient ORR catalysts and SERS substrates.									49	2	0	0	2	0	50			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000533328100010

Here, we demonstrate the preparation of urchin-like 3D nickel-iron phenyl phosphonates (NiFeP) hierarchical architecture fabricated by ultrathin nanosheets for photocatalytic water oxidation with high efficiency. The urchin-like NiFeP hierarchical architecture is prepared by a facile solvothermal synthesis without any organic additives. The urchin-like 3D hierarchical architecture exhibits a large specific surface area and abundant mesopores distribution, which affording more active catalytic sites and multi-electron transport channel. In the presence of high-valence Ni3+ sites could act as the main redox site to decrease the overpotential of water oxidation reaction. In consequence, using [Ru(bpy)(3)]Cl-2 photosensitizer under visible light irradiation, the urchin-like NiFeP photocatalyst demonstrates a high oxygen evolution activity, giving a superior O-2 yield of 76% and O-2 production rate of 23.66 umol s(-1 )g(-1). Moreover, the urchin-like NiFeP photocatalyst is highly stable for reuse. This work extends the development of transition metal phosphonates and provides a platform for designing high performance, economic and stable catalysts. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Water electrolysis has been regarded as an effective method for producing clean and ultrapure hydrogen gas. However, its large-scale applications are hampered by its slow kinetics, particularly due to its slow anodic half-reaction i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Another strategy based on chemical-assisted electrocatalytic energy-saving hydrogen production has recently been developed with great potential to address barriers associated with OER. In this case, OER is replaced by organic oxidation reactions that are thermodynamically more favorable, which substantially reduces the voltage required for H-2 evolution and also facilitates the co-production of organic value-added products. Oxidation of biomass derivatives, such as alcohols, is the most suitable strategy for producing value-added chemicals with energy-saving hydrogen production. This Review focuses on the characteristics of making electrolytic hydrogen production more cost-efficient by using different alcohols. We have reviewed the fundamentals and key parameters for alcohol-assisted electrochemical hydrogen production and discussed several anodic alcohol oxidation reactions with value-added products. The choice of electrocatalysts, strategies to increase the reaction selectivity, and the possible cell architectures are elaborated in detail.									15	0	0	0	1	1	15			2574-0962			WOS:000703338600002

Overpotentials of only 96.38 and 78.80 mV are required in hydrogen evolution reaction in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, to generate an electrocatalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2). A small Tafel slope of 70.67 and 63.21 mV per decade are also observed from NiFeP/CoP/CC revealing a Volmer- Heyrovsky mechanism in both media. The electrocatalyst also delivers excellent oxygen evolution reaction performance in the alkaline environment and long-term electrochemical durability for at least 24 h in electrolytes over a wide pH range. A device is assembled with two identical flexible ultrathin NiFeP/CoP/CC as both the anode and cathode in 1 M KOH driven by a set of 1.6 V solar cells. During 32 h of electrolysis, the results show that the current of our electrodes maintains 80% performance at a constant voltage of 1.7 V for 32 h, and the NiFeP/CoP/CC anodes and cathodes have large potential in industrial alkaline water splitting.									10	2	0	0	1	0	10			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000487730900002	31430731

The capacity of reversibly and sharply switching the magnetic state of FePc molecules by chemical means is conclusively evidenced by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Fe L-2,L-3 absorption edge. In the molecular oxygen-dosed phase, oxygen intercalates between the molecule and the surface, thereby switching the Fe magnetic moment from a nearly negligible (m(Tot)(exp) approximate to 0.26(1) mu(B)) to an order of magnitude larger value (m(Tot)(exp) approximate to 2.1(2) mu(B)). Moreover, the characteristic XMCD spectrum undergoes a crossover from metallic to oxidized Fe(III)-like line shape, in accordance with an oxygen-induced decoupling of the molecular electronic states from the underlying metal surface. The FePc acts as a reversible bifunctional chemical-magnetic switch at the atomic monolayer scale.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000355891600040

The Cr3+ cation has a special electronic configuration (t(2g)(3)e(g)(0)), which facilitates charge transfer and electron capture. However, Cr-based materials applied on water-splitting electrocatalysis is still a research void up to now. Herein, a novel amorphous gamma-CrOOH was developed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst toward overall water splitting for the first time. It shows extraordinary HER activity with an ultralow overpotential of only 149 mV at 50 mA cm(-2). Meantime, there is a small overpotential of 334 mV at 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER Importantly, the bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water-splitting electrocatalysis can work with a cell voltage of merely 1.56 V at 10 mA cm(-2). Amorphous gamma-CrOOH has effectively enhanced the intrinsic electrochemical activity via density functional theoretical calculations. Therefore, this work not only provides a new method for preparation of amorphous gamma-CrOOHbut also expands the types of catalysts for water splitting.									29	1	0	0	2	0	29			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000461978700053	30843395

Here, we develop a scaled-up and simple dual-oxidative etching strategy for introducing metallic copper into a NiFe hydroxide nanosheet array on a Ni foam electrode (Cu-NiFe LDH/NF) for the oxygen evolution reaction. This dual-oxidation strategy is achieved via a galvanic-corrosion reaction between the metallic Ni template and ions with higher reduction potential (Fe3+ and Cu2+). The as-prepared electrode exhibits unparalleled activity toward water oxidation with an overpotential of 185 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of merely 30 mV dec(-1), respectively. More importantly, this inexpensive and simple manufacturing technique affords the Cu-NiFe LDH/NF electrode excellent activity retention for over 1200 hours.									15	2	0	0	1	0	16			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000490983100010

However, due to the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), large overpotentials are required to drive the overall reaction. In this work, we demonstrate an environmentally friendly and energy-saving strategy by the synergy of the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to replace the ordinary water hydrolysis. In order to further boost the UOR kinetics, nickel borate (Ni-B-i) is synthesized by a facile co-precipitation method, forming a nanosheet morphology and 3D hierarchical porous structure. The resulting Ni-B-i catalyst exhibits exceptionally high catalytic performance for the UOR, achieving a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at 1.42 V vs. RHE, which is about 250 mV lower than that of the OER process. The two-electrode urea electrolytic cell composed of the Ni-B-i anode and a Pt cathode requires a small cell voltage of 1.66 V in order to reach a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) and is very stable. Overall, this work demonstrates a promising electrocatalyst system for efficient hydrogen production and simultaneous urea-containing wastewater treatment, providing valuable information for the development of advanced non-noble metal catalysts for the UOR.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2051-8153	2051-8161		WOS:000637706500001

In this work, the large-area ultrathin (2.52 nm thick) Ce-doped La2O3 nanofilms were developed via a facile and reliable ionic layer epitaxy method with different Ce content. The ultrathin Ce-doped La2O3 nanofilm with optimum composition of La1.22Ce0.78O3 exhibited an excellent OER performance with a very low overpotential of 221 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 33.7 mV dec(-1). A remarkable high mass activity of 6263.2 A g(-1) was also obtained from ultrathin La1.22Ce0.78O3 nanofilm at the overpotential of 221 mV. Such a high mass activity was three orders of magnitude higher than state-of-the-art commercial IrO2 powders (3.8 A g(-1)) and more than 30 times higher than La2O3 nanofilm (196.7 A g(-1)) without Ce doping at the same overpotential. This high mass activity was even significantly higher than other recently reported typical OER catalysts. The substantial OER performance gain by the Ce doping was attributed to the improved conductivity and electrochemical active surface areas of nanofilms as a result of favorable tuning on the charge transfer and electronic structures. This work provides a promising approach to develop high-performance two-dimensional (2D) electrocatalysts by effective heteroatom doping strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000773118400001	35255487

Developing an efficient and non-noble metal cathode toward oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) is of great significance for the commercial application of rechargeable ZABs. Herein, a flexible self-supported integrated bifunctional cathode is presented in which the Co-N-C nanoparticles are in situ anchored on Co4N nanosheets via a facile and scalable strategy. Benefiting from integrated 3D architecture with adequate active sites, porous structure, high conductivity originating from the metal substrate, and the synergistic effects of Co-N-C and Co4N, the cathode exhibits excellent bifunctional activity (low overpotential of 275 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for OER, high half-wave potential of 0.833 V for ORR), and ultralong durability for ORR/OER in the alkaline medium. Impressively, this cathode enables the recyclable aqueous ZABs a record overall lifespan over 10 000 cycles at 20 mA cm(-2), and a superior fast-charging feature at an ultrahigh charging current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, such a flexible integrated cathode can be directly used as a self-supported cathode for flexible solid-state ZABs, with excellent reversibility for 300 cycles, demonstrating its feasibility for practical application.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000728420000001	34889520

The nitrile chain reaction forms several oligomers including dimers, trimers and tetramers during the condensation process at low temperature. The results show the oligomers are pyrolyzed to small fragments at high temperature undergoing a variety of cross- linking and recombination to produce more stable benzene and pyridine based polycyclic aromatic groups prior to the final mesoporous carbon material formation. The cyano-based ionic liquids and nitrile chain reaction mechanism readily yields mesoporous carbon with a specific surface area of 1050 m(2) g(-1) and a high co-doping with N and S and a content of graphitized material. In terms of potential applications, the N, S-codoped mesoporous carbon material facilitates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) comparable to the benchmark of those commercial 20 wt% Pt/C and RuO2 catalysts, respectively. Remarkably, our analyses show bis(trifluoromethanesulphonyl)-imide (TFSI) anions display much better thermal stability than imidazolium cations, which suggests future potential for other functional cations with more thermally stable intermediate polymeric structures.

PCC 6803. The light-saturated rates of O2 evolution (V(O2)) measured in whole cells range from close to that of wild-type for Asp170Glu to zero for Asp170Ser and Ala. Those mutant strains that are best able to evolve O2 are also those that show the lowest K(m) in PSII core complexes for the oxidation of Mn2+ by oxidized Tyr161, the normal oxidant of the Mn cluster responsible for O2 evolution. To a first approximation, the lower the pK(a) of the residue at position 170, the higher the V(O2) and the lower the K(m). D1-Asp170 appears to participate in the early steps associated with the assembly of the Mn cluster. It is also the first reported example of an amino acid residue critical to the function and assembly of the oxygen-evolving complex.									233	1	1	0	195	0	234			0006-2960			WOS:A1992HB53600041	1731951

Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical structure composed of homogeneously distributed Ni-Fe-P nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbons on nickel foams (denoted as Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF) as an excellent bifunctional catalyst. This catalyst was fabricated by an anion exchange method and a low-temperature phosphidation of nanotubular Prussian blue analogue (PBA). The Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF displayed exceptional catalytic activity toward both HER and OER and delivered an ultralow cell voltage of 1.47 V to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) with extremely excellent durability for 100 h when assembled as a practical electrolyser. The extraordinary performance of Ni-Fe-P@NC/NF is attributed to the abundance of unsaturated active sites, the well-defined hierarchical porous structure, and the synergistic effect between multiple components. Our work will inspire more rational designs of highly active non-noble electrocatalysts for industrial energy applications.									18	0	0	0	2	0	18				2589-0042		WOS:000508685200031	31887660

However, the complex and slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process during operation greatly limits its application, thus the development of inexpensive and highly efficient electrocatalysts is of great importance. In this regard, a novel FeNi3/Fe-2(MoO4)(3)hybrid electrocatalyst is successfully synthesizedviaa facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent calcination process. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling interfaces between FeNi(3)and Fe-2(MoO4)(3), the electron-withdrawing effect of Mo(6+)could maintain active sites with a high-valence state from FeNi3, thereby contributing to a superior OER performance. Such a hybrid composite shows a low overpotential of 248 mV, achieving a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)and satisfactory long-term stability. The superior catalytic activity outstrips most previous reports of non-precious metal electrocatalysts. This design of hybrid catalysts will open up a promising avenue for highly efficient electrocatalysts by exerting the synergistic advantages of interface engineering at the atomic level.									3	1	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000553934700007

The conventional treatment process for livestock wastewater, including anaerobic digestion and anoxic-oxic treatment, is very common in China for the low operational cost. However, the very low BOD5/CODCr ratio (<0.1) in the associated effluent renders the further treatment process very difficult. In this study, a PbO2 anode coupled with a 2-ethylanthraquinone (EAQ)-modified graphite felt cathode was used to treat the livestock wastewater (BOD5/CODCr <0.1) discharged from the conventional two-stage anoxic/oxic (A/O) process. The results of scan electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy (FTIR) show that the prepared PbO2 electrode has a smaller crystal size, higher oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential and an excellent electro-catalytic performance compared to a purchased PbO2 electrode, and the EAQ-modified graphite felt cathode has a higher content of oxygen-containing functional groups and higher oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electro-catalytic performance than pristine graphite felt. The results of the electrolysis experiment showed that the BOD5/CODCr ratio was increased from 0.084 to 0.42 with 71.5% CODCr removal after 80 min of electrolysis, when the Fe2+ concentration was 0.3 mM. The (OH)-O-center dot produced in the electrolysis system was captured successfully by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the current battery technologies such as lithium ion batteries have limited theoretical energy density. Additionally, battery materials with small scale and high flexibility which could endure the large surface stress are highly required. In this study, a yarn-based 1D Zn-air battery is designed, which employs atomic layer thin Co3O4 nanosheets as the oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction catalyst. The ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized by a high-yield and facile chemical method and show a thickness of only 1.6 nm, corresponding to few atomic layers. The 1D Zn-air battery shows high cycling stability and high rate capability. The battery is successfully knitted into clothes and it shows high stability during the large deformation and knotting conditions.									66	3	0	0	0	0	66			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000450110500008	29388366

This work reports a systematic study of the relation between the electronic structure and OER performance of perovskite La1-xSrxFeO3 (0 <= x <= 1). The partial substitution of La for Sr in LaFeO3 results in the oxidation of Fe3+ to Fe4+ and substantially enhances OER activity. A comprehensive X-ray spectroscopic study reveals a strong correlation of the enhanced OER activity with these Fe4+ states. The presence of Fe4+ leads to a stronger Fe-O bond due to stronger Fe 3d-O 2p orbital hybridization and shifts the energy position of the valence band (VB) to E-F. Such an electronic modulation optimizes the surface adsorption energetics of *OH intermediates, contributing to faster OER kinetics. Furthermore, a new unoccupied state is created at similar to 0.9 eV below the conduction band. This hole state reduces the energy barrier for electron transfer from 1.34 eV to 0.44 eV, thereby facilitating charge transfer at the interface. The Fe4+-induced electronic states responsible for higher OER activity have implications for the understanding of structure-activity relationships in other Fe-based electrocatalysts such as highly active Fe-doped NiOOH.									48	2	0	0	2	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519704200021

Transition-metal phosphides have been proven to be efficient catalysts for water splitting. In this paper, surface phosphation of 3D NiCo2O4 nanowires grown on Ni foam (P-NiCo2O4/NF) have been prepared to investigate the effect of surface phosphating on catalyst activity. XRD and XPS results demonstrate that P element has been decorated on the surface of the NiCo2O4 nanowires. The electrochemical results prove that P-NiCo2O4/NF shows better electrochemical performance than pure NiCo2O4/NF as an electrode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of water splitting. It achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(2) at an overpotential of 279 mV and 164 mV for OER and HER in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, respectively. In addition, the P-NiCo2O4/NF parallel to P-NiCo2O4/NF electrode is constructed by employing P-NiCo2O4/NF as both the anode and cathode, it only requires a low 1.68 V of cell voltage to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Notably, P-NiCo2O4/NF parallel to P-NiCo2O4/NF also exhibits excellent stability for over 30 h-long. These results indicate that surface phosphation is an effective approach to improve the electrochemical performance of NiCo2O4/NF electrode materials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1793-2920	1793-7094		WOS:000519709500011

Herein, we develop a highly efficient and low-cost, bifunctional NiFe electrocatalyst that uses NiFe inverse opal nanostructures for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). From their increased surface area, NiFe inverse opal structures can reduce the overpotential by similar to 70 mV and similar to 90 mV for OER and HER, respectively. In addition, correlations between increased surface area of inverse opal 3-dimensional nanostructures and electrocatalytic activity of OER and HER are explored. Furthermore, a NiFe inverse opal structure with an optimized number of thickness layers reduces the overpotential of water splitting by similar to 160 mV. When integrated to four series-connected Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells, the NiFe inverse opal electrolyzer achieves a 9.54% solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency over 24 h under a zero-bias condition. The combined PEC water splitting investigated in this work is expected to provide a basis for the design of highly efficient renewable and sustainable water electrolysis systems that incorporate earth-abundant, low-cost materials.									36	3	0	0	0	0	36			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000418344200001

In this study, the CoP/ MnO hollow nanofibers with the advantages of a more extensive contact interface were successfully synthesized. We found that the construction of hollow nanostructures and the composite of oxides are effective strategies to optimize the OER catalytic performance of transition metal phosphides. The template of the precursor can adjust the hollow nanostructure and keep it stable during the phosphating process. It is worth noting that the CoP/MnO composite material only needs an overpotential of 230 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, it maintains the overpotential 263.5 mV after 5000 cycles of voltammetry measurements. In short, this research provides a simple solution for the design and realization of nanostructured electrocatalysts with excellent electrochemical performance. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, we report the synthesis of an efficient bifunctional electrocatalytic electrode of nanoporous nickel-iron hydroxides coupled with a small amount of metal Ni/Fe based on stainless steel fiber felt (SSF) by a simple electrodeposition method. The prepared catalysis electrode can significantly improve the overall water splitting performance The gaps of SSF are filled with nickel-iron hydroxide composites of which conductivity is improved by metal Ni/Fe simultaneously generated through electrodeposition. The synthesized electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance toward both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), only requiring overpotentials of 100 mV for HER and 210 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH. Employed as both anode and cathode for full water splitting, the obtained electrode also exhibits excellent activity, achieving an overall cell voltage of 1.80 V to attain 100 mA cm(-2). There is almost no potential drop after a long-time durability test. Electrocatalysis studies show the enhancement of water splitting activity may be caused by the synergistic action between the NiFe(OH)(x) nanosheets and SSF substrate, which benefits the chemisorption of oxygen and hydrogen- containing intermediates. The excellent activity and good stability would hopefully enable the prepared electrocatalyst to mitigate the main drawbacks of existing electrolysis technologies and provide possibilities of developing next-generation water splitting technologies.									26	0	0	0	4	0	26			2168-0485			WOS:000548456600030

Most of the NiFeOx catalysts in the form of layered double hydroxides feature a nanosheet structure, which limits their spatial extension at the electrode substrate. Herein, we report the fabrication of unique NiFeOx/CuO nanosheets/nanowires and their use as efficient electrocatalysts for the OER. The surface-bound Cu(OH)(2) nanowires were grown insitu on a copper substrate by a simple solution-based method, which were then converted to CuO nanowires by calcination in air. The coating of NiFeOx nanosheets was achieved by anodic co-deposition in concentrated carbonate solution containing Ni-II and Fe-III. The presence of concentrated carbonate anions allows Fe-III to be dissolved in a basic solution by complex ion formation. This strategy therefore avoids the destruction of CuO nanowires caused by the usual cathodic procedure in acidic solutions. At a planar copper foil, a small Tafel slope of 36mVdec(-1) was obtained in 1m KOH and a current density of 100mAcm(-2) was reached at a very low overpotential of 300mV from the Tafel plot. Electrolysis experiments showed high stability of the catalyst with nearly no loss in efficiency and morphology change after a prolonged period. The same catalyst could be established on a three-dimensional copper foam.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000426844600020

One of the bottlenecks of current ZAB technology lies in the lack of robust and cost-effective catalysts for effectively driving oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reactions simultaneously at air electrodes. Owing to the high intrinsic catalytic activity, low cost, and abundant reserves, cobalt (Co)-based nanomaterials have become one of the most promising bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing high-performance ZABs by using Co-based compounds as cathodes. Herein, the recent progress of Co-based electrocatalysts in ZABs is covered in four categories, including cobalt chalcogenides, cobalt oxides, Co-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs), and Co-N-C structures. In each category, synthesis approaches and modification strategies are illustrated, and the structure-performance relationships are discussed. To conclude, a brief summary of current achievements and challenges is provided, and a prospect for future explorations is proposed.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16				2688-4062		WOS:000710106800001

Herein, we report a multifunctional electrocatalyst termed as Rh/NiV-LDH, through integration of nickel-vanadium layered double hydroxide (LDH) with rhodium single-atom catalyst (SAC), to achieve this goal. The electrocatalyst delivers high HER mass activity of 0.262 A mg(-1) and exceptionally high turnover frequency (TOF) of 2.125 s(-1)at an overpotential of 100 mV. Moreover, exceptional activity toward urea oxidation is addressed, which requires a potential of 1.33 V to yield 10 mA cm(-2), endorsing the potential to surmount the sluggish OER. The splendid catalytic activity is enabled by the synergy of the NiV-LDH support and the atomically dispersed Rh sites (located on the Ni-V hollow sites) as evidenced both experimentally and theoretically. The self -supported Rh/NiV-LDH catalyst serving as the anode and cathode for overall urea electrolysis (1 mol L-1 KOH with 0.33 mol L-1 urea as electrolyte) only requires a small voltage of 1.47 V to deliver 100 mA cm(-2) with excellent stability. This work provides important insights into multifunctional SAC design from the perspective of support sites toward overall electrolysis applications. (c) 2022 Science China Press.

J	Kim, Nak Kyu; Lee, Mi Jung; Lee, Jong Ik; Kim, Jihyuk					Kim, Nak Kyu/0000-0002-2882-068X			Oxygen isotope record of magmatic evolution of alkaline volcanic rocks at The Pleiades, northern Victoria Land, Antarctica								GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL				25	6			787	797		10.1007/s12303-021-0002-x		MAR 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Oxygen isotopes are used to examine the well-documented magmatic evolution of alkaline volcanic rocks at The Pleiades in northern Victoria Land (NVL), Antarctica. Oxygen isotopes were measured in olivine, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase phenocrysts to better understand the origin and evolution of the sodic and potassic differentiation lineages. The volcanic rocks at The Pleiades evolved from a parental basanite by fractional crystallization in crustal magma chambers. Olivine which crystallizes first in the mafic magmas provides the initial oxygen isotope composition of the magmatic lineages. The delta O-18(OL) values for the mafic lavas in the sodic lineage are lower than the potassic lineage. The primary melt derived from the metasomatized lithospheric mantle may have consumed a low-delta O-18 amphibole metasome. Subsequently, the melt would have evolved to the normal-delta O-18 potassic lineage magma by a large contribution from surrounding peridotite. In contrast, the sodic lineage magma might preserve low-delta O-18 characteristics because of insufficient reaction with the surrounding mantle peridotite. Intermediate rocks of the potassic lineage exhibit a wide variation in their oxygen isotope compositions and it deviates from the theoretical normal-delta O-18 trend. Hence, variable delta O-18(OL) values of the intermediate rocks suggest that high-delta O-18 recorded in olivine could be reconciled with an assimilation of crustal rocks in NVL, and hydrothermally altered material may have contributed to low-delta O-18 signature of the olivines.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-4806	1598-7477		WOS:000628469000001

However, the generation of reduced multi-carbon products with high energy density and wide applicability from the CO2RR, such as oxygenates and hydrocarbons, suffers from high overpotential, slow reaction rate, and low selectivity due to its intrinsic multi-electron transfer nature. Moreover, the involved anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) also requires large overpotential and its product O-2 bears limited economic value. The potentially generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the OER may also degrade the membrane of a CO2 reduction electrolyzer. Herein, we review the recent progress in novel integrated strategies to address the aforementioned challenges in the electrocatalytic CO2RR. These innovative strategies include (1) concurrent CO2 electroreduction via co-feeding additional chemicals besides CO2 gas, (2) tandem CO2 electroreduction utilizing other catalysts for converting the in situ formed products from the CO2RR into more valuable chemicals, and (3) hybrid CO2 electroreduction through integrating thermodynamically more favourable organic upgrading reactions to replace the anodic OER. We specifically highlight these novel integrated electrolyzer designs instead of focusing on nanostructured engineering of various electrocatalysts, in the hope of inspiring others to approach CO2 electroreduction from a holistic perspective. The current challenges and future opportunities of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction will also be discussed at the end.									38	2	0	0	2	0	38			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000534338900002

The obtained GH-BGQD material has a unique 3D architecture with high porosity and large specific surface area, exhibiting abundant catalytic active sites of B-GQDs as well as enhanced electrolyte mass transport and ion diffusion. Therefore, the prepared GH-BGQD composites exhibit a superior trifunctional electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction with excellent long-term stability and durability comparable to those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts. A flexible solid-state Zn-air battery using a GH-BGQD air electrode achieves an open-circuit voltage of 1.40 V, a stable discharge voltage of 1.23 V for 100 h, a specific capacity of 687 mAh g(-1), and a peak power density of 112 mW cm(-2). Also, a water electrolysis cell using GH-BGQD electrodes delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at cell voltage of 1.61 V, with remarkable stability during 70 h of operation. Finally, the trifunctional GH-BGQD catalyst is employed for water electrolysis cell powered by the prepared Zn-air batteries, providing a new strategy for the carbon-based multifunctional electrocatalysts for electrochemical energy devices.									102	7	0	0	4	0	102			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000477779200005

Kinetic Tafel slope analysis suggests that the HER follows the Volmer-Tafel mechanism (29 mV dec(-1)), indicating that the recombination of the two adsorbed hydrogen atoms is the rate-determining step. The FeCoNi-based thick film (thickness: 168.3 mu m) shows a metallic state favorable for electron transfer; on the other hand, in the case of the FeCoNi-based thin film (thickness: 389.2 nm), the in operando XAS investigation reveals that Fe3+-assisted water dissociation promotes the formation of Co2+-mu-H-Ni3+ (catalyst-H-ad) species, which subsequently undergoes reductive elimination to furnish H-2 gas via the HER process. During the OER, the CoNi-oxide matrix acts as a chemical and electroconductive host to build/stabilize the key intermediate [Fe4+& xe001;O/Fe3+-O & x2d9;] motifs; this subsequently triggers the catalytic O-O bond formation (30 mV dec(-1)) through the radical-radical coupling of the adjacent [Fe4+& xe001;O/Fe3+-O & x2d9;] motifs or/and OH- attack on the Fe4+-induced electrophilic oxygen center, leading to the release of O-2. The mechanistic experiments provide advanced insights into the catalytic kinetics/intermediates and demonstrate that the electronically cooperative interplay among Fe/Co/Ni leads to enhanced alkaline water electrolysis. The CFeCoNiP catalyst exhibits an excellent HER activity (specific activity j(s) = 0.227 mA cm(-2)) with a low charge transfer resistance (3.9 omega) and an overpotential of 37 mV, achieving the current density of 10 mA cm(2); moreover, it shows good OER activity (j(s) = 1.798 mA cm(-2)) with low charge transfer resistance (2.1 omega) and an overpotential of 250 mV, approaching a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The CFeCoNiP/NF (electrodeposited on Ni foam) electrode-pair device achieved the current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm(-2) at the voltages of 1.65 and 1.86 V, respectively, under alkaline conditions.									75	3	0	0	5	0	75			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000536690000045

Until now, less work has been reported on tuning the structural interface configurations utilizing various carbon precursors to enhance catalytic activity toward overall water splitting. Herein, a facile one-pot pyrolysis strategy is developed to prepare the metallic cobalt with molybdenum carbide nanoparticles enclosed in porous carbon nanosheets hetemstmcture (Co/Mo2C/Co6Mo6C2@C) using different carbon sources, namely salicylic acid, phthalic acid, sodium tartrate, and fumaric acid. The optimum catalyst (CMC/750SA) exhibits a low overpotential of 138 and 281 mV @10 mA cm(-2) of current density for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. Also, the CMC/750SA catalyst exhibits outstanding activity toward HER with a low overpotential of 118 mV@10 mA cm(-2) in acidic H2SO4 (0.5 M) solution and attains robust stability over 48 h. The two-electrode configuration utilizing CMC/750SA as cathode and anode required a cell voltage of 1.589 V@10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. This work reveals that optimizing the interface structure engineering plays a crucial role in improving overall water splitting performance and helps to design an efficient carbon-based catalyst for extensive electrochemical applications.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000736687100004

The Y2O3-skull that is in contact with the TiAl-melt is relatively stable, which results in a more controlled reaction between the skull and the melt than in the case of an Al2O3 crucible is used. A thin reaction layer was formed between the mould and the melt through mutual diffusion. The layer thickness increased with increasing reaction time. The thickness of this layer was less than 80 mu m for reaction times up to 5800 s. Y2O3 particles were not found in the specimen because the mould coating was prepared with fine Y2O3 powder without a binder, which prevented the Y2O3 particles splitting from the coating as a consequence of thermal physical erosion. The oxygen content of the TiAl-alloy increased with increasing reaction time. The total oxygen content of the solidified specimen was less than that of the specimen solidified in the Al2O3 crucibles. This new Y2O3 skull-aided technology is expected to improve the surface quality of TiAl-alloys and reduce the reaction between the crucible/mould and molten TiAl alloys during directional solidification processing with longer contact times.									6	1	0	0	1	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000397185900001	28332635

The photosynthetic oxygen evolution showed stronger inhibition than the PSII photochemistry. The effects of the studied herbicides on both algal and cyanobacterial cells decreased in the following order: DCMU > isoproturon > ioxynil. Furthermore, we observed that the number of blocked PSII centers increased significantly after DCMU treatment (204-250 times) and slightly after ioxynil treatment (19-35 times) in comparison with the control cells. This study suggests that the herbicides affect not only the acceptor side but also the donor side of PSII by modifications of the Mn cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex. We propose that one of the reasons for the different PSII inhibitions caused by herbicides is their influence, in different extents, on the kinetic parameters of the oxygen-evolving reactions (the initial S-0 - S-1 state distribution, the number of blocked centers S-B, the turnover time of S-i states, misses and double hits). The relationship between the herbicide-induced inhibition and the changes in the kinetic parameters is discussed.									9	0	0	0	8	0	9			0939-5075	1865-7125		WOS:000407222500010	28258977

In this study, N-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) and Co/N-CNT catalysts are synthesized by grinding and subsequent calcination, and the whole process does not require strict control of the reaction conditions, thus greatly simplifying the synthesis route of the catalysts. The unique structure, in which Co nanoparticles are evenly embedded in the tube and tip of CNTs, exhibits outstanding ORR performance and electrochemical stability as a result of the Co-CNT interactions. Furthermore, due to the catalytic graphitization ability of Co nanoparticles, a high graphitization degree, large specific surface area, and abundant pore structure are achieved by adjusting the calcination temperature, thus accelerating electron transfer and oxygen diffusion. The optimized catalyst, calcined at 750 ? (Co/N-CNT-750), exhibits better ORR activity and excellent methanol tolerance in alkaline media, indicating its great potential for large-scale application in storage technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000828668900001

We gain insight into the crystal structure of Sr1-xCexCoO3-delta (x = 0.05, 0.1) and temperature-dependent structural evolution of Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-d by X-ray diffraction, neutron powder diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy experiments. Sr0.9Ce0.1CoO3-delta shows a perfectly cubic structure (a = a0), with a large oxygen deficiency in a single oxygen site; however, Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-delta exhibits a tetragonal perovskite superstructure with a double c axis, defined in the P4/mmm space group, that contains two crystallographically different cobalt positions, with distinct oxygen environments. The structural evolution of Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-delta at high temperatures was further studied by in situ temperature-dependent NPD experiments. At 1100 K, the oxygen atoms in Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-delta show large and highly anisotropic displacement factors, suggesting a significant ionic mobility. The test cell with a La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3-delta-electrolyte-supported (similar to 300 mu m thickness) configuration yields peak power densities of 0.25 and 0.48 W cm(-2) at temperatures of 1023 and 1073 K, respectively, with pure H-2 as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant. The electrochemical impedance spectra evolution with time of the symmetric cathode fuel cell measured at 1073 K shows that the Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-delta cathode possesses superior ORR catalytic activity and long-term stability. Mixed ionic-electronic conduction properties of Sr0.95Ce0.05CoO3-delta account for its good performance as an oxygen-reduction catalyst.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000352518600050	25756843	
J	Asl, Shahab Khameneh; Unar, Deniz								Photo corrosion of titania nanotubes within water splitting reaction								IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				7	1			69	73						WIN 2017	2017	Titania nanotubes (TNT) prepared by anodization of Ti foils were used for water splitting in a standalone cell. The concentration polarization between the anode side (1M NaOH) and cathode side (0.5 M H2SO4) ensured that the water splitting reaction could take place with no external bias and separate H-2 and O-2 evolution could be achieved. The destruction of TNT structures under 365 nm UV irradiation as well as the absence of the stoichiometry between the anodic and cathodic gas collectors indicates the limits of the stability of TNT structures under these conditions.									0	0	0		0	0	0			2252-0236			WOS:000402069600009

However, their catalytic performance is still limited due to poor electrical conductivity and limited specific surface area. Here, we demonstrate a generalizable approach to overcome these limitations by anchoring ultrathin nickel boride (NixB) sheets on the surfaces of functionalized small-diameter multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWCNTs). The electrochemically active surface area and charge transfer resistance of the resulting hybrid materials (NixB/f-MWCNT) is 3.4 and 0.24 times that of the NixB nanosheets, respectively. And, NixB/f-MWCNT exhibited superior catalytic activities and stability toward both oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution reactions. For the overall water splitting, it requires a cell voltage of 1.60V to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming existing metal boride catalysts as well as commercial IrO2/Pt/C catalysts. Further, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the strong chemical coupling between NixB and f-MWCNTs and the in situ formation of highly active NiOOH/NixB and Ni(OH)(2)/NixB heterojunctions, which contributes to the superior activity. The developed design concept can serve as a general approach to improve other electrocatalysts with low electrical conductivity and specific surface area, such as metal oxides, metal hydroxides, and metal-organic framework-derived materials.									79	6	0	0	3	0	80			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000455124900033

Co3O4 films were obtained by thermal treatment of Co electrodeposited from electrolytic solutions containing glycine at different pH values. Co3O4 films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The grain size of the electrocatalysts decreases to 100 nm and the oxygen vacancies content increases, as the pH of the solution was increased during the synthesis. Linear Sweep voltammetry (LSV) and Chronopotentiometry techniques were employed to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the films. Co3O4 electrocatalysts obtained at pH values higher than 7 exhibit a better electrocatalytic performance than the obtained at pH values less than 4, such as a potential to reach 1.5 mAcm(-2) of 0.6 V and 0.68 mV, respectively. Co3O4 synthesized under alkaline conditions exhibit the best charge transfer resistance with 4.3 Omega during OER electrolysis. The improvement is associated to the presence of oxygen vacancies that promote the activity and stability of the electrocatalysts toward the OER. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

When used for Li-ion batteries, these electrodes always show superior electrochemical performance for their merits, such as binder free, open framework, and robust adherence. Nevertheless, the current integrated electrodes usually lack an effective conductive network or require a tedious postfabrication process. Herein, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) is used as a bifunctional material, for its cohesiveness and ability of acting as N-doping carbon precursor, to fabricate integrated electrodes with 3D conductive networks. Owing to its high N content (12.4 wt%), large volume shrinkage, and gas production, porous conductive network forms when PVP is carbonized. This strategy is foolproof, low cost, and can be scaled-up. The electrodes fabricated by this method epitomize the merits of 3D conductive network, integrated structure, and open framework. As an example, MnOx@ C-Cu shows excellent electrochemical performance (1030 mA h g(-1) at 0.4 A g(-1) up to 350th cycles, and 320 mA h g(-1) at 2.0 A g(-1)) when evaluated as Li-ion battery anode owing to these merits. Moreover, other functional integrated electrodes are developed, paving an easy way to fabricate integrated electrodes with 3D conductive networks.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			2365-709X			WOS:000398999900002

Oscillatory behaviour in the evolution of heat of reaction was observed for mixtures close to the stoichiometric composition. The frequency of oscillation increased with rising temperature. The amplitude also depended on both temperature and feed gas composition, and was greatest under conditions such that the consumption of oxygen was almost complete. The oscillatory behaviour may be attributed to the periodic or aperiodic changes in a Pd-PdOx active phase, modulated by the specific reaction environment at elevated temperature.

The Janus WSSe monolayer with a direct band gap of 1.75 eV is subjected to biaxial strain, and related optoelectronic properties are investigated. The effect of strain is reflected in band gap change from direct to indirect. Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is active all over, whereas oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is active only at 4% and 6% compressive strains. The red- and blue-shifts under tensile and compressive strains, respectively, substantiate possible control over exciton-phonon interaction making it suitable for the water-splitting application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000701383500006

Herein, a trifunctional electrocatalyst of urchin-like Al,P-codoped Co3O4 microspheres supported on Ni foam (denoted as AP-CONPs/NF) was fabricated via a hydrothermal process and subsequent low-temperature annealing and phosphorization, exhibiting enhanced OER, HER and ORR activities compared with single-doped and undoped samples. Their surface self-organized microstructure and excellent "superaerophobic" feature make a high bubble repellency, which boost diffusion of reactants and electrolyte-electrode intimate contact. The codoping of Al and P elements into Co3O4 betters right the balance among surface chemical state, the increased oxygen vacancies and the promoted charge transfer. Encouraged by these synergistic advantages, the AP-CONPs/NF was further employed as excellent bifunctional electrodes for the OWS (low cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA cm(-2)) and as air cathode for rechargeable Zn-air batteries (high power density of 89.1 mW cm(-2)), which demonstrates a great feasibility for practical applications.

Herein, we demonstrate a simple and rapid, yet highly efficient method to fabricate Pd-CoO films of immaculate homogeneity as characterized using different imaging and spectroscopic techniques. The SEM images revealed that the films were composed of bimetallic spherical granules wherein both metals were uniformly distributed in an atomic ratio of similar to 1:1. The time-dependent investigations of the film fabrication behavior demonstrated that the films formed in shorter deposition times (1-2 h) display more porous character, allowing better access to the reaction centers. This character was transcribed into their enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using this specific bimetallic formulation, we could attain a low over-potential of 274 mV for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), whereas the high current density value of > 200 mA cm(-2) was achieved while still under 600 mV of over-potential. The cycling and current generation stability was also found to be sufficiently high, which can only be attributed to the facile electron transfer processes and a higher number of active sites available in homogeneous bimetallic films.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2045-2322			WOS:000608582500005	32879400

Herein, inspired by the superiority of carbon conductivity, the propitious H atom binding energy of metallic cobalt, and better OER activity of cobalt oxide, we synthesized cobalt-cobalt oxide/N-doped carbon hybrids (CoOx@CN) composed of Co-0, CoO, Co3O4 applied to HER and OER by simple one-pot thermal treatment method. CoOx@CN exhibited a small onset potential of 85 mV, low charge-transfer resistance (41 Omega), and considerable stability for HER. Electrocatalytic experiments further indicated the better performance of CoOx@CN for HER can be attributed to the high conductivity of carbon, the synergistic effect of metallic cobalt and cobalt oxide, the stability of carbon-encapsulated Co nanoparticles, and the introduction of electron-rich nitrogen. In addition, when used as catalysts of OER, the CoOx@CN hybrids required 0.26 V overpotential for a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is comparable even superior to many other non-noble metal catalysts. More importantly, an alkaline electrolyzer that approached similar to 20 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.55 V was fabricated by applying CoOx@CN as cathode and anode electrocatalyst, which opened new possibilities for exploring overall water splitting catalysts.									1353	70	0	0	56	0	1362			0002-7863			WOS:000350192700040	25658518

On the other hand, organic metal framework (MOF) can be used for the stabilization of metal nanoparticles with small size and uniform dispersion. Herein, we successfully synthesized a bifunctional electrocatalyst via a facile one-step hydrothermal treatment. Pt QDs cores are uniformly coated with Fe-MOF nanosheet arrays shell (Pt QDs @Fe-MOF) with a porous cuboids structure on Ni foam (NF). With the quantum size and core-shell structure, the self-assembled porous cuboids of Pt QDs @Fe-MOF exhibited perfect electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. Particularly, the electrocatalyst with ultralow content of Pt QDs (1.84 mu g cm(-2)) only needed the overpotential of 33 mV and 191 mV to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, respectively. In addition, the Pt QDs @Fe-MOF/NF electrodes possessed remarkable activity and stability to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.47 V for overall water splitting of at least 100 h.

Herein, by utilization of the electrodeposition technique, a new category of nickel-based materials, i.e. nanoporous nickel hydroxide@nickel (Ni(OH)(2)@Ni) films on carbon cloth (Ni(OH)(2)@ Ni/CC), has been reported as a Janus electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The asdeposited Ni(OH)(2)@ Ni/CC exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for the HER in alkaline electrolytes with an overpotential of 68 mV needed to drive the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and much better durability than Pt/C. This film is also efficient for catalyzing the OER in basic media. These films can be employed as catalysts on both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting that approaches 10 mA cm(-2) at a cell voltage of 1.58 V, with catalytic stability exceeding those with RuO2 and Pt/C catalysts. Density functional theory calculations further demonstrate that the Ni(OH)(2) and Ni in Ni(OH)(2)@Ni films synergistically favor the chemisorption of hydrogen-containing intermediates, thus leading to highly enhanced water splitting activity.									63	2	0	0	0	0	63			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000400553700007

Particularly, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are used as non-precious metal catalysts because of their controllable, high surface area and rich N content. Herein, a MOF is transformed into a three-dimensional and porous Co-N-C catalyst by a one-step synthesis method and the joint action of Zn and PVP is reported. The catalyst exhibited efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance (E-1/2 = 0.83 V vs. RHE) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance (E-j10 = 1.69 V vs. RHE). More meaningfully, the Zn-air battery (ZAB) assembled with the catalyst, exhibited superior 3100 min cycling charging/discharging stability and a high power density of 109.8 mW cm(-2), compared with the Pt-RuO2 of 2600 min of cycling charging/discharging stability and power density of 96.1 mW cm(-2). The solid-state ZAB based on the catalyst also showed excellent rechargeable flexibility and stability. Undoubtedly, this is a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalytic catalyst with practical application value.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2				1466-8033		WOS:000668621800001

The NiYCe-MOF/NF features an ultrathin nanosheet array structure and is uniformly and richly codoped by Y and Ce. When it was explored as both the anode and cathode electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, it achieved 10 mA cm(-2) at 136 and 245 mV for the HER and OER in an alkaline electrolyte, respectively. Notably, an extremely low cell voltage of 1.54 V was required to achieve 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution, making it a promising substitute for noble-metal catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000861146300001	36040824

As expected, the lattices of the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode and the Li4Ti5O12 anode in the cell are found to simultaneously contract during charging and expand during discharging. It is found that for the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode a solid-solution reaction is associated with the lattice change and the Ni2+/Ni3+ redox couple between 3.06 and 3.16 V (vs. Li4Ti5O12), and a two-phase reaction between LixNi0.5Mn1.5O4 and Ni0.25Mn0.75O2 is corresponding to the Ni3+/Ni4+ redox couple at voltage higher than 3.22 V (vs. Li4Ti5O12) without a corresponding change in lattice. The oxidation states of the metals in the electrodes are determined by tracking the associated change in the oxygen position. In addition, the Ti oxidation state is correlated to the intensity of the Li4Ti5O12 222 reflection at the anode, and the determined oxidation state of the Ni is correlated to the lithium occupancy within the cathode. Furthermore, the small volume changes of the cathode and the anode upon cycling suggest that the cell chemistry is favorable for practical applications.

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) predictions reveal that coupling Ni with Ni3C can not only facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, but also optimize the hydrogen adsorption and water adsorption energies. Experimentally, a facile strategy is designed to in situ fabricate Ni3C nanosheets on carbon cloth (CC), and simultaneously couple with Ni nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of an integrated heterostructure catalyst (Ni-Ni3C/CC). Benefiting from the superior intrinsic activity as well as the abundant active sites, the Ni-Ni3C/CC electrode demonstrates excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the OER and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which are superior to all the documented Ni3C-based electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Specifically, the Ni-Ni3C/CC catalyst exhibits the low overpotentials of only 299 mV at the current density of 20 mA cm(-2)for the OER and 98 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for the HER in 1mKOH. Furthermore, the bifunctional Ni-Ni3C/CC catalyst can propel water electrolysis with excellent activity and nearly 100% faradic efficiency. This work highlights an easy approach for designing and constructing advanced nickel carbide-based catalysts with high activity based on the theoretical predictions.									66	1	0	0	3	0	66			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000555958100001	32762000

Herein, it is reported that iridium doped tungsten trioxide (Ir-doped WO3) with arrayed structure and confined Ir sites is an efficient and durable bi-functional catalyst for overall acidic water splitting. A low overpotential (258 mV) is required to achieve an oxygen evolution reaction current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution. Meanwhile, Ir-doped WO3 processes a similar intrinsic activity to Pt/C toward hydrogen evolution reaction. Overall water splitting using the bi-functional Ir-doped WO3 catalyst shows low cell voltages of 1.56 and 1.68 V to drive the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with only 16 mV decay observed after 60 h continuous electrolysis under the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Structural analysis and density functional theory calculation indicate that the adjusted coordination environment of Ir within the crystalline matrix of WO3 contributes to the high activity and durability.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000703749100001	34612000

Here, for the first time, we report use of a wet-chemical method to synthesize partially hydroxylated ultrathin Ir nanosheets (Ir-NSs) of only five to six atomic layers' thickness. Detailed analysis indicates that the growth confinement effect of carbon monoxide and the partially hydroxylated surface play a critical role in formation of the ultrathin structure. The ultrathin Ir-NSs exhibit excellent performance for both the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction in a wide pH range, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt/C and IrO2, respectively. Density-functional theory calculations reveal that the partial hydroxylation not only enhances the surface electron transfer between Ir-sites and intermediate O-species, but also guarantees efficient initial activation of bond cleavage of H-O-H for first-step H2O splitting. This, ultimately, breaks through barriers to full water splitting, with efficient electron transfer essentially maintained.									26	2	0	0	0	0	26			2095-5138	2053-714X		WOS:000572868500011	34692162

Its partial amorphousness feature leads to enhanced stability and corrosion resistance, which help the B-Co2Fe LDH catalyst to work well in the critical seawater condition. It requires overpotentials of 310 and 376 mV to drive current densities of 100 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively, in 1 M KOH seawater and can work continuously for 100 h without producing any hypochlorite. This work can enable the development of LDH catalysts for highly selective seawater oxidation using a general approach.									48	1	0	0	2	0	48			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640479700004

Here, two nanostructured K-containing -MnO2 are synthesized: K--MnO2 nanosheets and K--MnO2 nanoparticles, both of which exhibit high catalytic activity in visible-light-driven water oxidation. The role of alkaline cations in oxygen evolution is first explored by replacing the K+ ions in the -MnO2 structure with H+ ions through proton ion exchange. H--MnO2 catalysts with a similar morphology and crystal structure exhibit activities per surface site approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of K--MnO2, although both nanostructured H--MnO2 catalysts have much larger BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface areas. Such a low turnover frequency (TOF) per surface Mn atom might be due to the fact that the Ru2+(bpy)3 sensitizer is too large to access the additional surface area created during proton exchange. Also, a prepared Na-containing -MnO2 material with an identical crystal structure exhibits a TOF similar to that of the K-containing -MnO2, suggesting that the alkaline cations are not directly involved in catalytic water oxidation, but instead stabilize the layered structure of the -MnO2.									72	3	0	0	6	0	74			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000314925400014

This current study also presents the in situ decoration of ethylenediamine (EDA) on acid-functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (O-MWCNTs). Moreover, an ethylene diamine is known to form a stable nitrogen source to make nitrogen rich MWCNTs as a metal-free electrocatalytic system. Those as-synthesised nanomaterials were characterised via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area analysis, which suggested the presence of N-containing active sites/defects in the lattice of the nanotubes. It is of great interest to the scientific community and still an impressive challenge; H-2 is a perfect candidate for the replacement of fossil fuels in the upcoming era due to the zero emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) species during its combustion. O-MWCNTs and EDA-MWCNTs nanomaterials exhibit OER with ultra-small overpotentials of 0.27 V and 0.19 V at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, having lower Tafel slopes of 49 and 40 mV dec(-1), respectively, in 0.5 M KOH. Moreover, the HER exhibits lower Tafel slopes of O-MWCNTs and EDA-MWCNTs 90 and 75 mV dec(-1), respectively, in 0.5 M H2SO4. These efforts further demonstrate the high potential of the as-synthesized nanocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This metal-free electrocatalyst offers a novel, efficient, highly stable, environmentally friendly and inexpensive process for its fabrication. The catalytic activity exhibits that the ethylene diamine decorated on a multi-walled carbon nanotube EDA-MWCNTs composite could be an encouraging electrocatalyst towards HER and OER from their supportive interfaces.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000623596600020

In this work, Co9S8 nanoneedles arrays are synergistically integrated with NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets to form Co9S8@NiFe-LDH core-branch hierarchical architectures supported on nickel foam (Co9S8@NiFe-LDH HAs/NF). The Co9S8@NiFe-LDH HAs/NF exhibits high catalytic performances for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with overpotential of 190 and 145 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. The density functional theory calculations predict that the synergy between Co9S8 and NiFe-LDH contributes to the high catalytic performance by lowering the energy barrier of HER. When used as both anode and cathode electrocatalyst, it can deliver 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.585 V with excellent long-term durability. This work opens a new avenue toward the exploration of highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Previously, we had reported the synthesis of single crystal, soluble nickel iron oxide nanopartides over a wide range of nickel:iron compositions, with a metastable cubic rock salt phase ([Ni,Fe]0) that can be isolated despite the low solubility of iron in cubic nickel oxide at ambient temperatures. Here, activity for OER was examined, catalyzed by these [Ni,Fe] 0 nanoparticles integrated with indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. Because the as-prepared [Ni,Fe] 0 nanopartides are oleate-capped, the surface ligands needed to be removed to induce adherence to the ITO substrate, and to enable charge transfer and contact with water to enable OER catalysis. Two different approaches were taken to reduce or eliminate the coverage of oleate ligands in these films: UV irradiation (254 nm) and air plasma. UV irradiation proved to lead to better results in terms of stable and OER-active fihns at pH 13. Kinetic analysis revealed that the Tafel slopes of these nanoparticle [Ni,Fe]0 OER electrodes were limited by the electrochemical surface area and were found to be within the range of 30 to 50 mV/decade. Across the four compositions of Ni:Fe studied, from 24:76 to 88:12, the observed overpotential at 10 mA/cm2 for the OER in basic conditions decreased from 0.47 to 0.30 V as the proportion of nickel increased from 24% to 88%.									43	1	0	0	0	0	44			1944-8244			WOS:000361252400029	26293239

A defect strategy has been applied to enhance their electrocatalytic activity with the modulation of the crystal/electronic structure. However, the intrinsic roles of the defects, particularly A-site vacancies, are poorly understood. Herein, we prepare LaxNiO3 with various ratios of A-site vacancies by a facile nonstoichiometric strategy, which has boosted the dual-function catalytic activity of LaNiO3. More importantly, the enhancement mechanism of A-site-deficient LaxNiO3 as an oxygen redox catalyst has been unveiled. Induced vacancy defects on the A sites raise a compression strain in the NiO6 octahedron, exerting a positive enhancement on Ni-O covalency. Furthermore, the e g electron filling in the active cation Ni and the overlapping state of Ni 3d-O 2p hybridization have also been optimized, in which renovation will further boost the catalytic ability of oxygen redox processes. This work not only clarifies the intrinsic roles of A-site deficiency in the structure and electrocatalytic activities of perovskite oxides but also presents some insights into the design and exploration of high-activity catalysts by cation defect modulation.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000519337600012

The Si-CNs were obtained by a modified chemical vapor deposition method. The Si-CN showed good activity towards ORR since most of the process was carried out efficiently by the four-electron transfer pathway, and it exhibited a low Tafel slope of 84.28 mV dec(-1) indicating that the material has a good kinetic activation response for ORR. This favorable response was attributed to 0.29 at. % silicon intercalated in the carbon lattice enhancing electrons transport at neighboring silicon sites. In addition, its mechanical robustness and thermodynamic stability influenced by the synthesis temperature contributed favorably to the energetic activation of Si-CN to the adsorption and reduction of oxygen. Therefore, Si-CN could be considered a potential metal-free and low-cost material for the ORR in alkaline fuel cells. (C) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Surfaces can be modified in a number of ways, for example by depositing nanoparticles or with functional coating layers. Here, the surface of La0.8Sr0.2MnO3- (LSMO) is treated with diluted HNO3. This process leads to the preferential formation of MnOx/LSMO on the surface, leading to the exposure of Mn cations at the surface of LSMO. The electrocatalytic activity of the MnOx/LSMO heterostructure towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is shown to increase when it is compared to the untreated LSMO. Thanks to the formation of MnOx at the surface, the resulting MnOx/LSMO possesses 1) a relatively high specific surface area and a mesoporous structure, 2) a higher coverage of Mn4+/Mn3+ cations at the surface, and 3) a high concentration of highly oxidative oxygen species. This work develops a facile strategy (i.e. HNO3 treatment) for improving the ORR activity of perovskite oxides in alkaline solution at room temperature.									36	1	0	0	1	0	36			2196-0216			WOS:000429413700015

However, the fabrication of well-defined 2D mesoporous amorphous-crystalline heterostructures with highly active heterointerfaces remains challenging. Herein, an efficient 2D heterostructure consisting of amorphous nickel boron oxide (Ni-B-i) and crystalline mesoporous iridium (meso-Ir) is designed for water splitting, referred to as Ni-B-i/meso-Ir. Benefiting from well-defined 2D heterostructures and strong interfacial coupling, the resulting mesoporous dual-phase Ni-B-i/meso-Ir possesses abundant catalytically active heterointerfaces and boosts the exposure of active sites, compared to their crystalline and amorphous mono-counterparts. The electronic state of the iridium sites is tuned favorably by hybridizing with Ni-B-i layers. Consequently, the Ni-B-i/meso-Ir heterostructures show superior and stable electrochemical performance toward both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline electrolyte.									8	0	0	0	2	0	8			2366-9608			WOS:000691676800001	34927951

We extract insights into the role of geometric strain on the electrochemical behavior in this class of materials by blending aluminum, gallium, or iron into a disordered nickel hydroxide lattice. The electrochemical behavior and electronic structure of the three binary composition series are found to be similarly influenced by each additive cation. Density functional theory models indicate that the additive cations asymmetrically impede the voltage-induced expansion and contraction of the nickel hydroxide host lattice, a feature that is supported by near-infrared spectroscopy. Reaction coordinate diagrams suggest that this distortion decreases the activation energy for electron transfer by decreasing the extent to which the lattice can expand and contract but that iron is unique in its ability to favor oxidation by distorting the shape of the potential energy surface of the oxidized state to lower the electron transfer coefficient. These results reveal that interference with voltage-induced structural changes by incorporation of suitably sized ions alters the electrochemical behavior but that overall electrocatalytic performance cannot be linearly controlled by such geometric distortions.									9	0	0	0	2	0	9			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000487859200046

For materials such as NiO (x) that readily form hydrous oxides, however, the smooth, compact films deposited by ALD may result in higher overpotentials due to low catalyst surface area compared to other deposition methods. Here, the use of ALD-NiO thin films as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is explored. Thin films of crystalline ALD-NiO are deposited and OER activity is tested using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fe incorporated from the electrolyte can increase the activity of NiO, and it is shown that the turnover frequency (TOF) increases tenfold by going from an Fe-poor to Fe-rich KOH electrolyte. Applying a potential exfoliates the NiO, increasing the number of electrochemically accessible Ni sites. Interestingly, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and CV, it is found that an Fe-rich electrolyte reduces the amount of restructuring and oxidation is found. It is shown that a high surface area, high TOF catalyst may be created by using a two-step process in which the sample is sequentially conditioned in Fe-poor then Fe-rich KOH. This work highlights the importance of pretreatment on catalytic activity for compact NiO films deposited by ALD.									179	3	0	0	5	0	179			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000361226700004

With the aim of advancing LFO photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), here, a nanorod array-type electrode combined with defect and surface engineering protocols has been demonstrated, delivering a benchmark performance of 0.4 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. RHE with an onset potential below 0.55 V vs. RHE. It was found that oxygen defects activated the surface towards OER, while NiFeOx coating suppressed surface recombination. It was discovered, however, that the performance was limited by rapid (nanosecond timescale) bulk recombination, as well as the ultrashort hole diffusion length (<5 nm). Overall, this work provides guidelines to accelerate the progress of LFO electrodes, as well as novel insights that afford a better understanding of oxide perovskite photoanodes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000616679700032

However, with the current catalysts containing one kind of active sites, it is challenging to achieve low overpotentials because of the four-electron transfer process. Herein is reported HZIF-2-CoMo, a new metal-organic framework with well-defined Co-Mo dual sites that can promote the OER process through an unconventional Mo-6(+)/Co-2(+) dual-site relay mechanism. Theoretical calculations suggested that the Mo and Co sites stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates, respectively, and that the unique Co-O-Mo configuration induces the formation of a Co-O*-Mo transition intermediate, remarkably reducing the reaction free energy. As a result, HZIF-2-CoMo shows an overpotential of 277 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 70 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution, making it one of the best OER electrocatalysts reported to date.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000625446000026	33576624

The development of multifunction EM attenuation materials that are compatible together EM absorption and EMI shielding properties is deserved our exploration and study. Here, the graphene-wrapped multiloculated NiFe2O4 composites are reported as multifunction EM absorbing and EMI shielding materials. The conductive networks configurated by the overlapping flexible graphene promote the riched polarization genes, as well as electron transmission paths, and thus optimize the dielectric constant of the composites. Meanwhile, the introduction of magnetic NiFe2O4 further establishes the magnetic-dielectric synergy effect. The abundant non-homogeneous interfaces not only generate effective interfacial polarization, also the deliberate multiloculated structure of NiFe2O4 strengthens multi-scattering and multi-reflection sites to expand the transmission path of EM waves. As it turns out, the best impedance matching is matched at a lower filled concentration to achieve the strongest reflection loss value of -48.1 dB. Simultaneously, green EMI shielding based on a predominantly EM absorption and dissipation is achieved by an enlargement of the filled concentration, which is helpful to reduce the secondary EM wave reflection pollution to the environment. In addition, the electrocatalytic properties are further examined. The graphene-wrapped multiloculated NiFe2O4 shows the well electrocatalytic activity as electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is mainly attributed to the interconnected structures formed by graphene and NiFe2O4 connection. The structural advantages of multiloculated NiFe2O4 expose more active sites, which plays an important role in optimizing catalytic reactions. This work provides an excellent jumping-off point for the development of multifunction EM absorbing materials, eco-friendliness EMI shielding materials and electrocatalysts.									19	0	0	0	2	0	19			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000791120300001

The oxide powders were produced in the form of films on pretreated Ni-supports by an oxide-slurry painting technique. The study showed that Sr-substitution in the oxide matrix did not influence the oxide roughness significantly. The true electrocatalytic activity of the catalyst decreased with increasing Sr-substitution. The reaction order has been found to be approximately unity in OH- concentration. The Tafel slope values at low potential ranged between similar to 103 and similar to 116 mV decade(-1). The rate of OE increased with increasing temperature following the Arrhenius law. Sr-substitution of 0.4 mol reduced the electrochemical activation energy (DeltaH(cl)(#0)) for OE by 12.9 kJ mol(-1). (C) 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

However, designing inexpensive multifunctional electrocatalysts with high performance is a great challenge. Here, a unique three-dimensional catalyst of self-interconnected porous Ni-Co disulfide networks grown on carbon cloth [(Ni0.33Co0.67)S-2 nanowires (NWs)/CC] was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method coupled with further low-temperature sulfuration strategy. As a bifunctional electrocatalyst, (Ni0.33Co0.67)S-2 NWs/CC exhibits a remarkable activity to catalyze both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To drive a current density of 100 mA cm(-2), (Ni0.33Co0.67)S-2 NWs/CC needs the overpotentials of 156 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution and 334 mV in 1.0 M KOH solution for HER, respectively. Moreover, when used as a catalyst of OER, (Ni0.33Co0.67)S-2 NWs/CC needs an overpotential of 295 mV to produce a current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The excellent electrochemical properties are mainly attributed to the synergetic catalysis of a Ni-Co-based bimetallic disulfide, the porous network structure, and the high conduction of CC. Moreover, the two-electrode alkaline water-splitting system constructed by (Ni0.33Co0.67)S-2 NWs/CC only needs a low cell voltage of 1.57 V to approach 10 mA cm(-2). This work offers more new insights for the design and preparation of the non-noble metal catalysts based on transition metal sulfides with excellent electrocatalytic performance in overall water splitting.									55	2	0	0	3	0	55			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000442706600019	30051715

Yet, the phase structure-catalytic activity correlation remains elusive because of the difficulty in synthesizing phase-pure Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides. Here, a simple room-temperature aqueous solution method has been developed to achieve phase-pure Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides with Fe content ranging from 0 to 100 at%. The Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides are simply derived from the metal-hydrazine complex by in situ transformation in alkaline solutions. The structural evolution and catalytic activity of the Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides are comprehensively studied to reveal the relationship between the structure and catalytic activity. The Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides present high activity at x = 0.3-0.7, and only a small overpotential of <260 mV is needed to achieve an anodic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. In addition, the catalysts exhibit high long-term working stability. It is found that their phase structure and electronic structure are related to the intrinsic activity and that the Fe/Ni ratio affects the electrical conductivity of Ni1-xFex (oxy)hydroxides for optimized performance.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000528920000041

Renderos, Genesis/0000-0002-6237-3625			Facile Method To Study Catalytic Oxygen Evolution Using a Dissolved Oxygen Optical Probe: An Undergraduate Chemistry Laboratory To Appreciate Artificial Photosynthesis								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				94	7			922	927		10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00074				JUL 2017	2017	Artificial photosynthesis (AP) is a synthetic chemical process that replicates natural photosynthesis to mass produce hydrogen as a clean fuel from sunlight-driven water splitting (2H(2)O -> O-2 + H-2). In both natural and artificial photosynthesis, an oxygen-evolving catalyst (OEC) is needed to catalyze oxygen production from water (2H(2)O -> O-2 + 4H(+) + 4e(-)). Herein, we present a simple undergraduate laboratory experiment for monitoring the catalytic oxygen-evolution reaction using a dissolved oxygen optical probe, a luminescent probe that can continuously measure the concentration of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solutions. The laboratory experiment consists of two parts. First, students identify and evaluate the necessary criteria for an active molecular O-2-evolving catalyst. Second, students use a kinetic protocol based on the method of initial rates to derive an empirical rate law expression and calculate the turnover frequency and rate constant for a benchmark OEC, [Ru-II(tpy)(bpy)(H2O)](2+) (tpy is 2,2 ':6 ',2 ''-terpyridine; bpy is 2,2 '-bipyridine). The use of simple transition metal complexes allows students to easily grasp how the choice of transition metals and the coordinated organic ligands can greatly impact the overall catalytic performance. Students collect time dependent dissolved oxygen plots, and analyze and interpret oxygen-evolution data using modern equipment. This laboratory protocol is simple, and allows students to relate many fundamental topics such as thermodynamics, kinetics, redox and coordination chemistry, and catalysis to advances in current chemical research to help broaden their understanding of artificial photosynthesis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000406254000018

The data obtained demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of the substrate in the voltage range from 12 to 14 V affected a pore diameter (d(pore)) in anodic films. Depending on the substrate type, d(pore) increased in the following order: glass > glass-ceramic > SiO2/Si > aluminum. It was found that the anodizing voltage (U-a) of 16 V was a turning point for anodic films obtained in sulfuric acid after which the slope of the lines for both d(pore) and D-inter (interpore distance) vs. U-a changed. This behavior might be explained by the occurrence of the overpotential enough for the beginning of the oxygen evolution reaction. We assumed that the oxygen evolution on aluminum oxide surface at the pore bottom at U-a > 16 V results in an increase in acid concentration in the solution and, consequently, in rise in acidic nature of the electrolyte and increase in the dissolution rate of the oxide layer of pore walls.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000623116800001

Herein, taking the recently synthesized MoNO composites modified carbon as representative, we clarified the multiple functions of axial oxygen ligand in improving the oxygen reduction activity. The active Mo atom is protruded from graphene plane due to the interaction with axial oxygen ligand, and during adsorption of oxygenates, the hanging oxygen ligand would wag to leave space and meanwhile tune the orbital orientation of Mo atom, giving rise to an optimal adsorption strength on the side in presence of oxygen ligand. The dynamic oxygen ligand may participate in the catalysis through hydrogenation reaction at the coadsorption stage with oxygen intermediate. The obtained overpotential of 0.35 V on MoN2O1-pen-gra along homolateral adsorbate evolution mechanism is comparable to recent experiments, approving the reliability of models and mechanism proposed in current study. The present results could provide some new insights into the functions of axial ligands and further guide the rational design of axial coordination to improve the catalytic performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0039-6028	1879-2758		WOS:000868327500001

Ethanol with a very limited amount of water under an inert atmosphere, significantly slows down the transformation reactions of ferrates(iv and v) and provides direct proof of the existence of intermediate states. Simultaneously, ethanol is oxidized to caboxylates in the close vicinity of the surface of ferrate crystallites as proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On the contrary, any transformation of ferrate(vi) in pure ethanol (with a very limited amount of water) was not observed. Mossbauer spectroscopy of frozen solutions enabled us to experimentally identify and quantify intermediates of ferrate(iv) and ferrate(v) transformations for the first time. Sodium ferrate(iv) in its tetrahedral form, Na4FeO4, undergoes a two-step charge disproportionation to Fe(iii) and Fe(vi) via a Fe(v) intermediate without any evolution of oxygen in polar protic and aprotic solvents, specifically 2Fe(iv) Fe(iii) + Fe(v), and Fe(iv) + Fe(v) Fe(iii) + Fe(vi), i.e. in sum 3Fe(iv) 2Fe(iii) + Fe(vi). Ferrate(v) (K3FeO4) transforms to Fe(iii) and Fe(vi) without any indication of the Fe(iv) intermediate within the detection limit of the method. In addition to a charge disproportionation reaction proceeding in polar liquids, 3Fe(v) Fe(iii) + 2Fe(vi), a competitive reduction of Fe(v) directly to Fe(iii) accompanied by oxygen evolution takes place in water. Oxygen evolution was also measured for ferrate(iv and vi) transformations in water, but to a higher and a smaller extent compared to ferrate(v), respectively. The thermodynamics of the suggested ferrate(iv) and ferrate(v) transformation pathways was examined by DFT calculations.									11	1	0	0	4	0	12			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000453231100014	30483690

Here a series of cobalt phosphide (CoP) electrocatalysts with a variety of index facets are successfully prepared including concave polyhedrons CoP exposing with (211) crystal planes (CoP CPHs) spherical nanoparticles CoP exposed with (011) crystal planes and polyhedron particles CoP exposing with (011) and (111) crystal planes. The results show that CoP CPHs based Li-O-2 battery presents a large discharge capacity of 33743 mA h g(-1) at current density of 50 mA g(-1) and a remarkable long cycle life of up to 950 h. The experimental results demonstrates that the CoP CPHs electrode exposing with high-index (211) facets based Li-O-2 battery exhibits an extremely low overpotential (0.67 V) ultrahigh specific capacity (33743 mAh g(-1)) and remarkable long-term stability of up to 950 h. Most importantly density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the excellent electrocatalytic activity of high-index (211) facets as compared to the low-index (011) and (111) planes are because of the existence of large density of atomic steps edge ledge sites and kinks which supply a wide space for breaking chemical bonds and increasing the reaction activity for oxygen electrode.

The fabrication of an integrated structural air electrode with stable parallel micropore channels and excellent electrocatalytic activity is an efficient strategy for solving these problems. Herein, a novel approach involving the synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (N-CNT) arrays on a carbon paper substrate with a conductive carbon-black layer for use as the air electrode is presented. This design achieves faster oxygen, lithium ion, and electron transfer, which allows higher oxygen reduction/evolution reaction activities. As a result, the N-CNT arrays (N/C = 1:20) deliver distinctly higher discharge and charge capacities, 2203 and 186 mAh g(-1), than those of active carbons with capacities of 497 and 71 mAh g(-1) at 0.05 mA cm(-2), respectively. A theoretical analysis of the experimental results shows that the parallel micropore channels of the air electrode decrease oxygen diffusion resistance and lithium ion transfer resistance, enhancing the discharge and charge capacities and cycle performance of Li-air batteries. Additionally, the N-CNT arrays with a high pyridinic nitrogen content can decompose the lithium peroxide product and recover the electrode morphology, thereby further improving the discharge-charge performance of Li-air batteries.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2079-4991		WOS:000495666800067	31623370

The development of cost-effective electrocatalysts with suppressive activity for hydrogen evolution reaction is critical for improving the efficiency of NRR Herein, oxygen-containing molybdenum carbides (O-MoC) embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon layers (N-doped carbon) can be easily fabricated by pyrolyzing the chelate of dopamine and molybdate. A rate of NH3 formation of 22.5 mu g.h(-1).mg(cat)(-1) is obtained at -0.35 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with a high faradaic efficiency of 25.1% in 0.1 mM HCl + 0.5 M Li2SO4. Notably, the synthesized O-MoC@NC-800 also exhibits high selectivity (no formation of hydrazine) and electrochemical stability. The moderate electron structure induced by the interaction between O-MoC and N-doped carbon shells can effectively weaken the activity of hydrogen evolution reaction and increase the faradaic efficiency of NRR. Additionally, by applying the in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, an associative reaction pathway is proposed on O-MoC@NC-800. This work provides new insights into the rational design of carbon-encapsulated metal nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for NRR at ambient conditions.									59	2	0	0	4	0	59			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000484831100031	31393100

The composite was used for non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide sensing and electrochemical overall water splitting. The core-shell structure was established from the transmission electron microscopy image analysis. Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis confirmed the interaction between CuO and CQDs. The electrochemical studies showed the limit of detection and sensitivity of the prepared composite as 2.4 nM and 56.72 mu A mu M-1 cm(-2), respectively. The core-shell structure facilitated better charge transportation which in turn exhibited elevated electro-catalysis towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting. The overpotential of 159 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for HER and an overpotential of 322 mV was required to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) current density for OER in 1.0 M KOH. A two-electrode system was constructed for overall water splitting reaction, which showed 10 and 50 mA cm(-2) current density at 1.83 and 1.96 V, respectively. The prepared CuO@CQDs@CHNS catalyst demonstrated excellent robustness in HER and OER catalyzing condition along with overall water splitting reaction. Therefore, the CuO@CQDs@CHNS could be considered as promising electro-catalyst for H2O2 sensing, HER, OER and overall water splitting.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000474115000001

However, their roles as photocatalysts in the photoinduced charge separation (CS) reactions remain unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the CS dynamics of a newly designed hybrid catalyst by integrating a Ru complex with Ni(OH)(2) nanoparticles (NPs). Using time resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XTA), we directly observed the formation of the reduced Ni metal site (similar to 60 ps), unambiguously demonstrating CS process in the hybrid through ultrafast electron transfer from Ru complex to Ni(OH)(2) NPs. Compared to the ultrafast CS process, the charge recombination in the hybrid is ultraslow (>> 50 ns). These results not only suggest the possibility of developing Ni(OH)(2) as solar fuel catalysts, but also represent the first time direct observation of efficient CS in a hybrid catalyst using XTA.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000366583300001	26673578

For comparison, coatings with x = 0.05 were also prepared using vitreous carbon substrates. Cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the coating roughness (R (f)). Values between 5,145 +/- 148 and 6,334 +/- 277 were obtained, depending on the x value, for the coatings on Ni foam. These results show that the electrodes prepared with LaNi1 -aEuro parts per thousand x Cu (x) O-3 powder, obtained at 600 A degrees C, lead to a big increase on the oxide electrode roughness when compared with LaNiO3 electrodes prepared by a similar method. Much lower values were obtained for the coatings on vitreous carbon indicating that the substrate nature is also a key factor for the preparation of high surface area electrodes. The calculated kinetic parameters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) show that the partial replacement of Ni by Cu has no beneficial effect on the intrinsic catalytic activity of the coatings. On the other hand, a big increase on the active area is observed even for small amounts of Cu (x = 0.05), leading to a better overall OER performance for the LaNi0.95Cu0.05O3 coating on Ni foam.

Local (spatially-resolved) voltammetry and Tafel analysis reveal that electronic interaction with the underlying metal substrate plays a significant role in modulating the electrocatalytic activity of h-BN, with Au-supported h-BN exhibiting significantly enhanced HER charge-transfer kinetics (exchange current is ca. two orders of magnitude larger) compared to Cu-supported h-BN, making the former material the superior support in a catalytic sense.									21	1	0	0	1	0	21			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000458165500008	30556069	
J	Anderson, LB; Ouellette, AJA; Barry, BA								Probing the structure of photosystem II with amines and phenylhydrazine								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				275	7			4920	4927		10.1074/jbc.275.7.4920				FEB 18 2000	2000	Photosynthetic oxygen evolution is catalyzed at the manganese-containing active site of photosystem II (PSII). Amines are analogs of substrate water and inhibitors of oxygen evolution. Recently, the covalent incorporation of C-14 from [C-14]methylamine and benzylamine into PSII subunits has been demonstrated (Ouellette, A. J. A., Anderson, L. B., and Barry, B. A. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 2204-2209). To obtain more information concerning these labeling reactions. t-[C-14]butylamine and phenylhydrazine were employed as probes. Neither compound can be oxidized by a transamination or addition/elimination mechanism, but both can react with activated carbonyl groups, produced as a result of posttranslational modification of amino acid residues, to give amine-derived adducts. C-14 incorporation into the PSII subunits D2/D1 and CP47 was obtained upon treatment of PSII with either t-[C-14]butylamine or [C-14]phenylhydrazine. For t-butyl-amine and methylamine, the amount of labeling increased when PSII was treated with denaturing agents. Labeling of CP47, D2, and D1 with methylamine and phenylhydrazine approached a one-to-one stoichiometry, assuming that D2 and D1 each have one binding site. Evidence was obtained suggesting that reductive stabilization and/or access are modulated by PSII light reactions. These results support the proposal that PSII subunits D2, D1, and CP47 contain quinocofactors and that access to these sites is sterically limited.									15	0	0	0	13	0	15			0021-9258			WOS:000085378200055	10671529

The hybrid electrocatalysts composed of transition metal oxides and N-doped carbonaceous materials are promising bifunctional ORR/OER electrocatalysts, whose improved electrocatalytic activities can be attributed to the synergistic effect originated from the metal-N-C active sites. Herein, NiFe2O4/N-doped graphene (NFO/NG) composites are prepared which own enhanced OER, especially superior ORR performance for the utilization of rechargeable Zn-air batteries. Significantly, it is also verified that the interfacial Ni-(pyridinic or pyrrolic) N-C species, rather than Fe-N-C, play key role infactors for promoting ORR/OER bifunctional electrocatalysis. The optimized catalyst displays remarkably reduced overpotential for both ORR and OER with an overall potential difference as low as 0.67V. The assembled rechargeable Zn-air battery shows a high specific capacity (513.6mAhg(zn)(-1)) and power density (173.6mWcm(-2)), as well as a long-term cycling stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2699-9412			WOS:000783856100007

In this study, a facile coordination bridging strategy is proposed to construct bifunctional Co-CoN4 hybrid active sites embedded in porous N-rich carbon nanolamellas (denoted as Co-CoN4@NCNs) for both the ORR and OER. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that the increased intrinsic ORR/OER activities can be attributed to the efficient interfacial charge transfer between the atomic Co-N sites and metallic Co sites due to their robust electronic correlation. In situ Raman spectroscopy confirms that the OER activity depends on the CoOOH intermediates formed during the reaction. Co-CoN4@NCNs exhibits superior bifunctional catalytic performance for the ORR (E-1/2 = 0.83 V) and OER (eta = 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) conducted in alkaline media. The assembled rechargeable Co-CoN4@NCNs-based ZAB displays an open-circuit voltage of 1.47 V, peak power density of 118.8 mW cm(-2), specific capacity of 776.7 mAh g(-1), and outstanding cycling stability over 1500 cycles. The regulation of the interfacial electronic properties can contribute to the rational design of bifunctional electrocatalysts used in rechargeable metal-air batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000865554600001

Developing novel nonprecious bifunctional electrocatalysts is particularly essential for improved performance metal-air batteries by overcoming sluggish oxygen reactions. Herein, we demonstrate a composite electrocatalyst with bimetallic CoNi alloy nanocrystals embedded within nitrogen-doped highly graphitic carbon spheres (N-CoNi/PCS). Owing to the efficient design strategy, such a composite electrocatalyst exhibits a unique pomegranate-like morphology and microstructure. When applied to an alkaline electrolyte system, the porous electrocatalyst delivers a low half-wave potential of 0.80 V toward ORR and overpotential of 540 mV toward OER with excellent durability. The high performance is systematically studied and ascribed to the unique nanoarchitecture which enables fast ion transportation and electron transfer, easy access to abundant active sites, and robustness. This work forwards the field of fabricating a highly active, affordable, and stable bifunctional electrocatalyst for energy conversion.									24	3	0	0	0	0	24			2574-0970			WOS:000517856800046

Using an automatized electrochemical setup enabled us to run a complex ADT protocol including online detection of the effective solution resistance as well as linear voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry, cyclic galvanograms, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for 55 h in total. Using this protocol, we tested the service life stability of a nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOx) catalyst based on Raney Ni. The catalyst was prepared by growing nickel oxyhydroxide on high-surface-area Raney Ni and subsequent formation of the active phase. The successful synthesis of the active NiOx phase is supported by cyclic voltammetry and Raman spectroscopy. The as prepared and activated Raney NiOx exhibits an overpotential for the OER of 304 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1) and roughness factors as high as 4515 determined by EIS during OER. By concentrating for the ADT protocol on current densities relevant for coupling water electrolysis to photovoltaics, it is demonstrated that Raney NiOx is a promising anode material candidate as it is earth abundant and its active phase exhibits high OER activity as well as stability.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000501279800031	31173447

Herein, we report a series of composites based on Cu, Pd and Cu-Pd nanoparticles (NPs) supported on high surface area graphite (HSAG), as electrocatalysts for the energy-related reduction reactions - oxygen reduction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions.All the composites showed interesting ORR electrocatalytic activities in alkaline medium. The Pd/HSAG and Cu-Pd/HSAG composites exhibited the most promising performances, with onset potentials of 0.84 and 0.91 V and current densities of j(L, 0.3 V, 1600 rpm) =-3.5 and -4.2 mA cm(-2), respectively. All the composites showed selectivity for the 4-electron process and Tafel slopes in the range 48-77 mV dec(-1). The metal/HSAG composites revealed a great tolerance to methanol and moderate electrochemical stability.In highly acidic medium (0.5 mol dm(-3) H2SO4, pH = 0.3) only the Cu-Pd/HSAG and Pd/HSAG electrocatalysts presented electrocatalytic activity toward HER, with relative low overpotentials (eta(10) = 0.145 and 0.063 V, respectively), small Tafel slopes (75 and 42 mV dec(-1)) and similar exchange current densities (0.43 and 0.57 mA cm(-2)). These electrocatalysts also showed moderate electrochemical stability, in particular Cu-Pd/HSAG for which overpotential only changed between 0.033 and 0.038 V for j = 40 mA cm(-2).The results showed that only small loading of Pd NPs (1 wt.% Pd) was able to improve significantly the ORR/HER electrocatalytic activity, which is a very important outcome to rationalize the design of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts in future.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000579549200029

However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance-influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and alpha-Ni(OH)(2) active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance-influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step-like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER EF180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH-PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(-) for alkaline anion-exchange-membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure-activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000801999700001	35460119

The development of an efficient electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions is described here following a simple hydrothermal route. Here, a method for the synthesis of NiCo2S4/Co9S8, Co9S8, and NiCo2S4 nanotubes has been developed. The NiCo2S4/Co9S8 heterostructure has been introduced as an efficient electrocatalyst towards HER under alkaline conditions (1.0 m KOH). The vertically aligned nanotube heterostructure (NiCo2S4/Co9S8) shows the most efficient activity as compared to bare Co9S8 and NiCo2S4 nanotubes. The heterostructure of NiCo2S4 and Co9S8 shows a significant anodic shift in the onset potential compared to the bare counterpart. NiCo2S4/Co9S8 can generate a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) upon application of only -0.172 V vs. RHE, whereas Co9S8 and NiCo2S4 require -0.293 V and -0.239 V vs. RHE, respectively. The heterostructure formation and the nanotube morphology of Co9S8 and NiCo2S4 facilitates a fast charge transportation which results in higher electrocatalytic activity. The hydrogen gas evolution rate of the NiCo2S4/Co9S8 heterostructure was determined to be 2.29 mu mol min(-1).									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1861-4728	1861-471X		WOS:000449792900014	30209888

This composite SFCNF/Co1-xS@CoN, consisting of S-doped flexible carbon nanofiber (SFCNF) matrix, Co1-xS nanoparticles, and CoN coatings, is prepared by integration of electrospinning and atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. Representative results include the following: 1) ultrathin CoN layer is deposited by ALD on the surface of flexible substrate without any sacrifice of SFCNF and Co1-xS; 2) the composite exhibits strong electrocatalytic activity in both acidic and basic solutions. The overpotentials of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are 20 and 180 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)in basic medium. A small Tafel slope of 54.4 mV dec(-1)is observed in 0.5mH(2)SO(4)electrolyte; 3) tested as overall water splitting electrode, the composite records a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)at a relative low cell voltage of 1.58 V and long-term stability for 20 h at a current density of up to 50 mA cm(-2). The superior performance for overall water splitting is probably attributed to the synergistic effect of Co1-xS and ALD CoN. Specifically, implementation of ALD can be extended to innovate nanostructured materials for overall water splitting and even other renewable energy aspects.									30	4	0	0	1	0	33			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000551121500001	32700457

Characterizations with scanning electron microscopy show rock-shape of the deposited copper through potentiostatic method, which can be further sulfurized to microflower morphology by a unique underpotential electrochemical method. The size and amount of the deposits can be adjusted by controlling applied potentials, leading to the optimization of electrocatalytic activity. The Cu2S@NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance towards HER and OER in 1 M KOH with the low overpotentials of 105 mV and 194 mV at 10 mA/cm2, as well as small Tafel slopes of 92.89 mV/dec and 72.81 mV/dec, respectively.

Conjugated conductive metal-organic frameworks (cMOFs) with multicomponent layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to construct bifunctional heterostructure catalysts are considered as an efficient but complicated strategy. Here, the fabrication of a cMOF/LDH hetero-nanotree array catalyst (CoNiRu-NT) coupled with monodispersed ruthenium (Ru) sites via a controllable grafted-growth strategy is reported. Rich-amino hexaiminotriphenylene linkers coordinate with the LDH nanotrunk to form cMOF nanobranches, providing numerous anchoring sites to precisely confine and stabilize Ru-N-4 sites. Moreover, monodispersed and reduced Ru moieties facilitate H2O adsorption and dissociation, and the heterointerface between the cMOF and the LDH further modifies the chemical and electronic structures. Optimized CoNiRu-NT displays a significant increase in electrochemical water-splitting properties in alkaline media, affording low overpotentials of 22 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 255 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively. In an actual electrochemical system, CoNiRu-NT drives an overall water splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.47 V to reach 10 mA cm(-2). This performance is comparable to that of pure noble-metal-based materials and superior to most reported MOF-based catalysts.									14	0	0	0	1	0	14			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000751841300001	35014086

Hydrogen production via earth-abundant water resources is a clean, sustainable, and energy-rich fuel source. For the water splitting process, the catalyst is an essential need to enhance the kinetics of the overall reaction. Therefore, noble metals are used as the state-of-the-art catalyst for the OER and HER process due to their remarkable efficiency and stability. But, their high cost and inadequacy are the main obstructs to their commercialization. To commercialize the process, researchers are trying to replace the expensive noble catalyst with a non-noble stable, conductive, and more productive catalyst. In recent decades, transition metal based metal organic framework (MOF) has been extensively used as an electro-catalyst to enhance the kinetics of the OER and HER process. MOF as an electro-catalyst is a promising candidate to improve the rate of water splitting reaction due to their inherent properties such as high surface area, tunable morphology, and high porosity. In this review, the significant data of recent years are assembled for the water splitting process by using the MOFs as an electro-catalyst. This review not only captures the advancement in MOF materials with the effective approach of designing but also indicates the catalyst evaluation parameters and detailed mechanism of the HER and the OER process. Meanwhile, challenges and future prospectus of the MOF based catalyst for the water splitting process are also described here. Hopefully, this review article will help to develop a more productive MOF for the generation of green and sustainable hydrogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-692X			WOS:000804730800001

Co3O4 is currently explored as an alternative OER catalyst. Herein we prepared Co3O4 films on fluorine-doped Sn oxide (FTO) glass and Ti foil via thermal decomposition of nitrate salts and evaluated their activity and stability in 0.05 M H2SO4. Crystalline Co3O4 films deposited on FTO were stable during chronopotentiometry at 10 mA cm(-2) for over 16 hours. The dissolution rate was 61 ng(Co) cm(-2) min(-1). The choice of a stable support such as FTO is essential to ensure the stability of the catalyst-substrate interface and to prevent substrate passivation under OER conditions. Doping Co3O4 with Li resulted in a higher OER activity under acidic conditions to be attributed to the larger electrochemical surface area, although the stability was impeded compared to undoped Co3O4.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000589775100001

Cyclic voltammograrns of HIROFs display two reversible redox couples commonly assigned to the Ir(III)/Ir(IV) and Ir(IV)/Ir(V) transitions, respectively. However, compared to the first, the second redox couple has significantly less charge associated with it. This effect is interpreted as partial oxidation of Ir(IV) as limited by nearest neighbor repulsion of resulting Ir(V) sites. Thus, the redox process is divided into two steps: one preceding and one overlapping the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, the "super-nernstian" pH dependence of the redox processes in the HIROF is used to expose how pH controls the overpotential for oxygen evolution, as evidenced by the complementary increased formation of Ir(V) oxide. A recently formulated binuclear mechanism for the OER is employed to illustrate how hydrogen bonding may suppress the OER, thus implicitly favoring Ir(V) oxide formation above the thermodynamic onset potential for the OER at low pH.									63	0	0	0	4	0	63			1932-7447			WOS:000326366800070		
J	Farid, Sumbal; Mao, Qing; Ren, Suzhen; Hao, Ce; Dong, Xufeng								Promoting the Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Morphological Manipulation of a Lamellar Nanorod-Assembled Ni(II)-Pyrazolate Superstructure								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES											10.1021/acsami.2c14192		OCT 2022			2022	Nanoscale pyrazolate-based coordination polymers (CPs) are becoming increasingly popular as electrocatalysts owing to their customizable compositions and structures. However, using them for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly challenging due to their unsatisfactory catalytic efficiency and relatively low stability. Herein, a simple one-step solvothermal process was employed for the fabrication of polycrystalline nickel-pyrazolate [Ni(Pz)] with an unusual lamellar nanorod-assembled microsphere morphology for the first time using ethanol as a green organic solvent via controlling other physical parameters. Meanwhile, the Ni(Pz) structure and morphology are investigated to derive its formation process following the different monomeric feed ratios relying on the metal/ligand interactions of CP. Shaping the Ni(Pz) electrocatalyst in well-oriented lamellar nanorod-assembled microspheres brings the advantage of porosity and high specific surface area, which expedites mass/charge transport and contact with the electrolyte as well as creates less tortuous pathways for charge distribution, thus improving the charge homogeneity. These high-class structural features and polycrystalline nature of Ni(Pz)-E-PVP facilitate amazing catalytic OER activity with a low overpotential of 290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of only 94 mV dec(-1) beyond the yardstick material (i.e., RuO2) in alkaline solution. A suite of measurements, entailing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, suggest that the rich Ni-N-4 moieties in Ni(Pz)-E-PVP are central species providing adsorption sites for OER intermediates. This facile protocol is prophesied to commence the imminent development of noble metal-free, effective, and low-priced electrocatalysts for OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000873780400001	36240000

The mesoporous (Fe/Ni)(P/S) dendritic nanorods were obtained as a freestanding and stable catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The mechanism of formation of mesoprous structure with nanorods is due to in-situ removal of Cr atoms (from the hard template of SSM) while the O-2 bubbles released during OER served as dynamic bubble template (soft template). The as-prepared sample exhibited overpotentials of 173 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 270 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), which exceeded those that were recently reported using surface modified stainless steel-based catalysts for OER in alkaline condition. Moreover, the (Fe/Ni)(P/S) nanorods showed a remarkable Tafel slope of 65.7 mV dec(-1) with stable activity beyond two months with only 2,5% fluctuation. The above outstanding performance could be attributed to the unique morphology with highly exposed active sites and the control of electronic structure by co-treatment with P and S. This work presents an efficient way to modify SSM for use as an inexpensive and durable OER catalyst. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, a series of NiSx (i.e., NiS, Ni3S2, NiS2) nanocrystals with controllable phase and composition have been synthesized via a facile polyol solution process and the corresponding electrocatalytic properties towards OER and HER have been systematically investigated. Electrochemical results reveal that Ni3S2 exhibits superior OER and HER performance to NiS and NiS2, achieving 1.63 V to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in the overall water splitting device, which is comparable to that of noble metal catalysts. Experimental and theoretical calculation investigations demonstrate that the remarkable catalytic properties of Ni3S2 could be attributed to the intrinsic metallic conductivity, abundant active sites and optimal Gibbs free-energy for catalyst-H* for HER. Moreover, a thicker layer of catalytically active species of NiOOH was generated on the surface of Ni3S2 due to the higher proportion of Ni, leading to a better OER performance. These results should shed light on the design and development of low cost and efficient transition metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts through phase and composition regulation for advanced electrochemical energy conversion devices.									102	8	0	0	2	0	103			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000465361800053	30865205

It remains a great challenge to simultaneously host high-active and independent ORR and OER sites in a single catalyst. Herein a dual-phasic carbon nanoarchitecture consisting of a single-atom phase for the ORR and nanosized phase for the OER is proposed. Specifically, single Co atoms supported on carbon nanotubes (single-atom phase) and nanosized Co encapsulated in zeolitic-imidazole-framework-derived carbon polyhedron (nanosized phase) are integrated together via carbon nanotube bridges. The obtained dual-phasic carbon catalyst shows a small overpotential difference of 0.74 V between OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2) and ORR half-wave potential. The ZAB based on the bifunctional catalyst demonstrates a large power density of 172 mW cm(-2). Furthermore, it shows a small charge-discharge potential gap of 0.51 V at 5 mA cm(-2) and outstanding discharge-charge cycling durability. This study provides a feasible design concept to achieve multifunctional catalysts and promotes the development of rechargeable ZABs.									37	1	0	0	1	0	37			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000674844300001

Thus, it is necessary to develop efficient electrocatalysts based on more abundant elements. Here, we report that Co3O4 nanobelt arrays (NBAs) assembled with ultrathin nanosheets which are less than 2.3nm thick prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates are an example of such CER electrocatalysts. The Co3O4 NBA anode is better than RuO2-based anodes in terms of CER activity and is far more stable than RuO2-based anodes.									26	0	0	0	3	0	26			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000437469300057

The Pt-Cu-Ni solid rhombic dodecahedra as an intermediate product can be well controlled by adjusting the amount of reaction time and Ni precursor. Based on the formation mechanism of Pt-Cu nanoframes, the morphological evolution process of ternary nanoframe is precisely investigated according to the changes of morphology, atomic ratio and average particle size. In addition, shape-tunable Pt-Cu-Ni nanoframes catalyst shows enhanced mass activity of 0.86 A mg(-1) Pt at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode towards oxygen reduction reaction, which is 6 times as well as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Remarkably, there is a more positive onset potential of Pt-Cu-Ni nanoframes compared to other catalysts. More importantly, this synthetic method opens a promising door towards development and applications of Pt based catalysts.									26	3	0	0	1	0	26			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000451936400006

Herein, we develop an effectively electrospinning to embed the oxygen vacancy-containing Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta(BSCF) particles into carbon nanofibers (BSCF@C nanofibers) towards the self-assembly cathode with high ORR and OER performance. Predictably, the BSCF@C nanofibers successfully prevent the BSCF particles from aggregation, facilitate O-2 adsorption and diffusion, enhance the electron transfer, accelerate the Li 2O 2 nucleation/decomposition, and enhance the stability of cathode. Different from the conventional cathode, the LOBs with the BSCF@C nanofibers cathode perform an outstanding electrochemical performance, which providing a high discharge specific capacity of 11976 mAh g(-1) and ultralong cycling stability of 98 times at the current density of 400 mA g(-1). Notably, this work opens up an opportunity for the perovskite oxides with high crystallization temperature for high-performance energy storage systems at ambient temperature. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

A one-dimensional pseudo-homogeneous model is used. The membrane is an inorganic and non-perm-selective one; nevertheless, it enables an oxygen flow high enough to ensure the progress of the reaction. The influence of different disturbances (feed composition, pressure and temperature) on the evolution of conversion of ethylbenzene and selectivity to styrene is analyzed. Membrane reactor allows achieving high selectivity to styrene and moderate conversion of ethylbenzene, keeping a low oxygen concentration on the reaction side. Styrene production overcomes the expected amount to carry out the design.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-5748	1542-6580		WOS:000344852500001

Reactions were done in a cyclic redox mode in which the oxidized catalyst was reacted with methane at 850 degrees C in the absence of oxygen.

Nevertheless, the sluggish electrons transfer accompanied with limited active sites impede their large-scale application. Generally, the silicon dioxide (SiO2) is employed as sacrificial template to regulate morphological structure of target products. However, selecting SiO2 as sacrificial shell may be a novel method to overcome the limitations and further optimize the performance of Fe2O3 . Hence, a novel self-activation strategy along with reduction treatment is presented to prepare oxygen vacancy-engineered Fe2O3 porous microspheres featured with high specific surface area (SA-Fe2O3 (Ov)). Specifically, the simultaneously formation of rich oxygen vacancies , porous configuration could regulate electronic configuration, expose numerous active sites and enhance elec-trons transfer, leading to superior achievement for HER and Li-S batteries. Remarkably, the elaborately designed SA-Fe2O3 (Ov) achieves low overpotential and relatively small Tafel slopes. Furthermore, SA-Fe2O3 (Ov) holds great promise serving as sulfur host in the field of Li-S batteries with reversible capacity and impressive dura-bility. This work contributes new insights into the self-activation strategy coupled with reduction synthesis of oxygen vacancy-engineered porous oxides with large specific surface area and raises the understanding of multifunctional energy applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000828112400001

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated on Pt, Ni, and NiMo catalysts in various concentrations of cations and anions to describe their performances by quantifying kinetics and mass transport. The choice of electrolyte in terms of its identity and activity drastically altered the HER performance. Electrolyte properties (activity coefficient, kinematic viscosity, and diffusion coefficient) accurately described the mass transport contribution, which was easily isolated when a highly active Pt catalyst was used. The HER rate on the Pt was maximized by tuning the solute"concentration (typically 1.5 to 2.0 M). Moreover, the kinematic viscosity and oxygen solubility under such densely buffered conditions governed the oxygen mass-transport flux in the electrolyte, which, in turn, tuned the crossover flux. At near-neutral pH, as high as 90% selectivity toward the HER was achieved even under an oxygen-saturated condition, where only a 40 mV overpotential was needed to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER. This information can be regarded as an important' milestone for achieving a highly efficient water splitting system at near-neutral pH.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1932-7447			WOS:000369116100046

Photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting is a key aspect of producing hydrogen from solar power. However, practical water oxidation over photoanodes (in combination with water reduction at a photocathode) in PEC cells is currently difficult to achieve because of the large overpotentials in the reaction kinetics and the inefficient photoactivity of the semiconductors. The development of semiconductors that allow high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiencies and the utilization of these materials in photoanodes will be a necessary aspect of achieving efficient, stable water oxidation. This Review discusses advances in water oxidation activity over photoanodes of n-type visible-light-responsive (oxy)nitrides and oxides.									109	5	0	0	7	0	108			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000437668700005	29265720

Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes have a cracked-mud structure, typical of oxide electrodes prepared by thermal decomposition. The introduction of platinum in the oxide layer has a packing effect in the coating morphology. The electrochemical characterization of these electrodes has been performed in acid medium, and a relation between the roughness factor (measured from electrode capacitance) and electrochemical porosity (related to the voltammetric charge) has been established. The mechanism for the oxygen evolution reaction has been determined by Tafel measurements indicating that the electrodes prepared are nonactive electrodes. The electrocatalytic activity strongly depends on geometric factors, since the activity toward oxygen evolution increases with the electrochemical porosity. Anodic stability of Ti/SnO2 electrodes has been checked with accelerated service life tests. The introduction of platinum in the oxide coating increases the service life by 2 orders of magnitude.									176	17	0	0	32	2	184			1520-6106			WOS:000220942900013

Here, a simple, one-step synthetic route is reported to prepare hexagonal nanosandwich-shaped Ni@Ru core-shell nanoparticles (Ni@Ru HNS), in which Ru shell layers are overgrown in a regioselective manner on the top and bottom, and around the center section of a hexagonal Ni nanoplate core. Notably, the synthesis can be extended to NiCo@Ru core-shell nanoparticles with tunable core compositions (Ni3Cox@Ru HNS). Core-shell HNS structures show superior electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to a commercial RuO2 black catalyst, with their OER activity being dependent on their core compositions. The observed trend in OER activity is correlated to the population of Ru oxide (Ru4+) species, which can be modulated by the core compositions.									41	2	0	0	3	0	41			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000422789800005	29171686

Herein, a novel olivine structured lithium mixed transition-metal phosphate material anchored on graphene sheets (LiNi0.75Fe0.25PO4/rGO) is reported as a highly effective OER catalyst. The synergy between the catalytic activity of the olivine-structured LiNi0.75Fe0.25PO4 and the enhanced conducting, buffering and confining effects arising from in situ introduced graphene nanosheets resulted in superior electrocatalytic properties. It exhibits an extremely low overpotential of 295 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), fast kinetics with a small Tafel slope of 47 mV per decade in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte and maintains its high catalytic activity after consecutive 2000 cycles, which are superior to those of the benchmark RuO2 and IrO2 catalysts under identical experimental conditions and comparable to those of the best noble metal-free OER electrocatalysts reported so far. This achievement provides a straightforward route to design cost-effective and efficient catalysts from commercially available materials to replace the state-of-the-art noble-metal electrocatalysts for large-scale water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000378102400020

More importantly, on investigating the performance of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, TiO2 microspheres consisting of micro-decahedrons with etched {001} facets show superior photoreactivity compared with TiO2 microspheres wrapped with intact-{001} faceted anatase crystals. As determined by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement, short hydrothermal reaction time facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, whereas longer hydrothermal reaction time contributes to the decrease of oxygen vacancies and formation of subsurface Ti3+ defect states. Based on the PL emission spectra obtained at different excited wavelengths, a possible mechanism of charge separation and transport resulting from changing of bulk/ surface trapping sites on the building blocks of TiO2 microspheres is proposed, and the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of the as-prepared TiO2 microsphere is largely attributed to the efficient separation and transport of photogenerated charge carriers caused by rational surface modulation and modification.									15	1	0	0	2	0	16			2046-2069			WOS:000393761600064

NiFeOxHy-based electrocatalysts have attracted extensive attention owing to their excellent electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To realize their commercialization, NiFeOxHy-based catalysts are being ameliorated for better performance in the OER. Here, we present a simple and scalable approach for fabricating NiFeOxHy by preparing a Ni-Fe master alloy plate followed by electrochemical activation including cyclized oxidation and reduction of metal ions. During the activation, the amorphous layer evolved only on the catalyst surface by circulating the oxidation states of Ni and Fe. The activated NiFeOxHy required only 250 mV of overpotential for 10 mA cm(-2) and 30 mV dec(-1) of Tafel slope, which is much better than the electrodeposited NiFeOxHy. The enhanced OER activity originates from the amorphous surface layer which contains partially oxidized Ni ions. This study suggests valuable possibilities for the design of better OER electrocatalysts using simple electrochemical methods.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000613720100066

This noble metal-free electrode was fabricated by cathodic electrolysis of aqueous Co(NO3)(2) followed by anodic electrolysis of a mixture of Mn2+, Co2+, and cetyltrimethylammonium (CTA(+)) ions in water. The CTA(+) ions accommodated in the interlayer spaces of Co-doped delta-MnO2, were replaced with Mg2+ by ion exchange. The upper MgCo-MnO2 could effectively block the permeation of Cl- ions and allow only H2O and O-2, while the under alpha-Co(OH)(2) acted as an oxidation catalyst for the H2O penetrated through the upper coating. Thus, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was preferred to the chlorine evolution reaction (CER). In artificial seawater (pH 8.3), the blocking effect against Cl- decreased because of ion exchange of the intercalated Mg2+ ions with Na+ in solution, but the OER efficiency still remained at 57%, much higher than that (28%) without the upper Mg vertical bar Co-MnO2. This demonstrates that the interlayer spaces between MnO2 layers acted as pathways for H2O molecules to reach the active sites of the underlying Co(OH)(2). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the most stable structure of hydrated Mg2+ ion, in which a part of coordinated H2O molecules is hydrolyzed, has less affinity toward Cl- ion than that of hydrated Na+ ion.									20	3	0	0	0	0	22			0743-7463			WOS:000537150900017	32347730

Unfortunately, methods to narrow its bandgap by incorporating higher ZnO concentrations are accompanied by extensive Urbach tailing near the absorption-edge, which is indicative of structural disorder or chemical inhomogeneities. We evaluated whether this disorder is intrinsic to the bond-length distribution in GZNO or is a result of defects introduced from the loss of Zn during nitridation. Here, the synthesis of GZNO derived from layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursors is described which minimizes Zn loss and chemical inhomogeneities and enhances visible-light absorption. The average and local atomic structures of LDH-derived GZNO were investigated using X-ray and neutron Scattering and are correlated with their oxygen evolution rates. An isotope-contrasted neutron-scattering experiment was conducted in conjunction with reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulations. We showed that a bond-valence bias in the RMC refinements reproduces the short-range ordering (SRO) observed in structure refinements, using isotope-contrasted neutron data. The findings suggest that positional disorder of cation-anion pairs in GZNO partially arises from SRO and influences local bond relaxations. Furthermore, particle-based oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in AgNO3 solution reveal that the crystallite size of GZNO correlates more than positional disorder with oxygen evolution rate: These findings illustrate the importance of examining the local structure of multinary photocatalysts to identify dominant factors in particulate-based photodriven oxygen evolution.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000407522300041

The deposited films were utilized to study the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at various MoS2 contents (25, 50, 75 wt.%). The surface state of the obtained heterostructure electrodes was characterized using various surfaces sensitive techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM images exhibited the fragmentation of the microparticles to smaller sizes in the nanoscale range. An analysis of the XPS spectra revealed the improvement in the cumulative synergy between the nanostructured Co3O4 and MoS2 in the heterostructured Co3O4-MoS2 electrocatalyst. We found that the gradual addition of MoS2 caused an enhancement in the OER activity due to improved charge transfer kinetics. Moreover, the heterostructure electrode with 75 wt.% MoS2 showed the highest activity with the lowest OER overpotential value of 298 mV at 10 mA..cm(-2) and the smallest Tafel slope value of 46 mV.dec(-1), as well as, 50 h OER stability at a current density of 50 mA.cm(-2).

XPS investigations showed that the films formed on both the amorphous Ni78Si8B14 alloy and polycrystalline Ni at open-circuit potential and after polarization at 0.4 V-RHE consist of Ni(OH)(2), while the films formed after polarization at 0.5 V-RHE consist of NiOOH. No traces of B or Si in the uppermost of the hydroxide films produced on the amorphous Ni78Si8B14 alloy were found. STS showed that all films formed on the amorphous Ni78Si8B14 had more n-type semiconductor character than those formed on polycrystalline Ni. Electrochemical investigations indicated that the amorphous Ni78Si8B14 alloy is a better electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction than polycrystalline Ni. We discuss whether this can be attributed to an enhanced electron density on the Ni sites in the alloy leading to an increase in the tunneling probability of the electrons on the surface film. This can subsequently enhance its catalytic action towards the oxygen evolution reaction. (c) 2007 The Electrochemical Society.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000246179800051

Firstly, the nickel chloride salt-urea-solvent (H2O. glycerol/H2O and ethylene glycol/H2O) systems were applied to adjust the morphology of Ni(OH)(2) on NF. The SEM results showed that the nanoplates and interspaces of deposited Ni(OH)(2) were regulated by adding organic solvent to influence the self-assembly process of Ni(OH)(2). Further upon anodizing Ni(OH)(2)/NF samples, NiOOH/NF electrodes were obtained accordingly and utilized for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Based on electrochemical active surface area (EASA), the best activity toward OER was obtained on the electrode NiOOH/NF-30glycerol-8 with the current density of 0.20 mA/cm(2) @1.72 V vs. RHE. The evaluations of electrochemical active surface area for NiOOH/NF electrodes indicate that the increased active sites are attributed to the best OER efficiency on NiOOH/NF-30glycerol(-8).

A correlation between the data of the above techniques has been noted, indicating a redistribution of the components (i.e. Ni and Fe) in the surface layers, the latter being enriched with iron(III) as compared to the bulk. The results obtained are in good agreement with an excellent electrocatalytic activity of composite Ni-Fe hydroxide systems towards anodic oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolytes, taking into account a distinctly exhibited 'surface' electrocatalytic effect of ferric species on the nickel hydroxide electrode in the anodic oxygen evolution process revealed previously.

The doping of various elements into LDH has been widely investigated in order to further minimize the oxygen evolution overpotential. Herein, by using the cation exchange method, we design and construct a Fe-doped Ni-Al LDH nanoplatelets (NAF LDH-25). Fe3+ enter the nickel and aluminum vacancies smoothly as a result of the dual action of corrosion and cation exchange, and iron ion activity is optimized. Meanwhile, strong interaction of Ni and Fe, effect of Al on electronic structure and the structural advantages of two-dimensional nanoplatelets, as a result, the as-prepared NAF LDH-25 exhibits extremely low overpotential (288 mV) at high current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The NAF LDH-25 also showed excellent stability in the 72 h chronopotentiometry test. Therefore, cation exchange strategy provides a new option for the preparation of practical OER catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2199-692X			WOS:000757815900001

In this paper we perform more accurate calculations of the absorption spectrum of hematite using the one-shot Green's function (G(0)W(0)) and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) methods, which take excited states into account and compare the spectrum to experimental data. We found a match between our calculations and the observed absorption spectra in peak locations. Furthermore, there is anisotropy of the absorption spectra that is concurrent with the crystal structure. We also calculated the absorption spectrum of hematite intermediates during catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction to better understand which intermediate is dominant during the reaction and the contribution of excited states to catalysis. The *O intermediate was found to be the most optically and chemically dominant species during catalysis.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1549-9618	1549-9626		WOS:000562139200008	32603108

Characterization of the catalysts by X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirms that the as-prepared oxides contain gamma-MnO2 and hydrous RuO2 with the morphology of fusiform nanorods and nanoparticles, respectively. Linear scanning voltammetric measurements reveal that the binary oxides exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activities towards both the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions. Li-O-2 batteries with Mn-Ru oxides as cathode catalysts show a higher discharge voltage plateau and a higher specific capacity of 6500 mA h g(carbon)(-1) than those with Ketjen black (KB) alone, and the subsequent charge voltage is ca. 500 mV lower than that with KB. Moreover, much enhanced cyclability of Li-O-2 batteries is achieved with a capacity retention ratio of 73.2% after 5 cycles. The cyclability is maintained for 50 cycles without sharp decay under a limited discharge depth of 1100 mA h g(carbon)(-1), suggesting that such a bifunctional electrocatalyst is a promising candidate for the air electrode in Li-air batteries.									77	1	0	0	2	0	78			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000328955200044

However, Co-based PBA (Co-PBA) electrocatalysts are characterized by moderate OER kinetics. In this study, we developed a facile high-yield strategy to fabricate defective Co-PBA (D-Co-PBA) with [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies and exposed Co (III) active sites by post-oxidation treatment of the pristine Co-PBA with aqueous H2O2. Rietveld refinement results show that the lattice parameter (a) and unit-cell volume (V) of D-Co-PBA are smaller than those of the pristine Co-PBA, thereby confirming the generation of [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the [Fe(CN)(6)] vacancy can effectively regulate the electronic structure of D-CoPBA; this condition reduces the reaction barrier of the rate-determining step toward OER. In OER, the DCo-PBA catalyst achieves a lower overpotential of 400 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(2), which is superior to that of Ir/C (430 mV) and Co-PBA (450 mV). A hybrid sodium-air battery assembled with Pt/C and D-Co-PBA catalysts displays a discharge voltage of 2.75 V, an ultralow charging-discharging gap of 0.15 V, and a round-trip efficiency of 94.83% on the 1000th cycle at the current density of 0.01 mA cm(-2). This study is highly promising for large-scale production of affordable and effective PBA-based materials with desirable OER activity for metal-air batteries and water-alkali electrolyzers, thus helping achieve the goal of sustainability.

Determinations of the reactivity profiles have been performed for reaction rates varying up to a factor of 100 and for burn-off from 20 up to 80%. The apparent reaction order and activation energy in oxygen are estimated for each sample over a 100 K temperature range (cases vary from 573 to 885 K) and a maximum oxygen partial pressure range of 0.01-1 bar. For the different fuel samples reaction orders range from n=0.65 to 0.78, and global activation energies are found in the narrow range of 130-133 kJ/mol. For Carboxen n=0.91 and E=146 kJ/mol. The reactivity differences between the coal chars are proposed mainly due to variations in the physical structure. Over the pressure-temperature domain examined reactivity Varies considerably, but the structural profile is approximately invariant, i.e. each sample exhibits consistently the same structural evolution for a broad span of kinetic conditions. The structural profile is different for each carbonaceous material. In the 20-80% burn-off range, Carboxen undergoes a four-fold increase in reactivity, while for coal-derived chars the reactivity decreases by a factor ranging from 2 to 5. These results emphasize the importance of a sound understanding of the structural evolution of a given sample in evaluating and using kinetic parameters. Global kinetic parameters are obtained by isolating kinetics from structural effects. A flexible reactivity measure is used to rank fuels with very different structural profiles, at varying levels of burnout, temperature and oxygen partial pressure.									31	5	0	0	2	0	35			0016-2361			WOS:A1996TM03900005

This report explores an advanced and effective "soft" material-assistant method to fabricate Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 electrocatalysts with a 0.6/0.4 ratio of Ir/Sn in precursors. Adopting a series of characterization methods, the collective results suggest that the surfactant-material F127 content, as an important factor, can efficiently control the formation of Ir-Sn oxides with varying surface properties and morphologies, such as the grainy and rod-shaped structures. Associating with the half-cell and single electrolyzer, it is affirmed that the optimal ratio of (It + Sn)/F127 is 100 for the preparation of S100-Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 with obviously enhanced activity and sufficient durability under the electrolysis circumstances. The lowest cell voltages obtained at 80 degrees C are 1.631 V at 1000 mA cm(-2), and 1.820 V at 2000 mA cm(-2), when applying S100-Ir0.6Sn0.4O2 OER catalyst and Ti-material diffusion layer on the anode side and Nafion (R) 115 membrane. Furthermore, the noble-metal It loading in the same cell decreases to 0.77 mg cm(-2). These results highlight that Ir-Sn oxide synthesized by the soft-material method is a promising OER electrocatalyst.

The morphological evolution during chemical vapor deposition is investigated and the new knowledge enables precise facet cutting. The synthesized Cubic In2O3 microparticles possess superior photoelectrocatalytic activity and excellent chemical and structural stability in oxygen evolution reaction on account of the unique surface structure and electronic band structure of the {001} facets. Our results reveal that it is feasible to promote the photolectrochemical water splitting efficiency of photoanode materials by controlling the growth on specific crystal facets. The technique and concept can be extended to other facet-specific materials in applications such as sensors, solar cells, and lithium batteries.									46	3	0	0	1	0	48			1948-7185			WOS:000346759700012	26273977

For the first time, owing to these aims, we report a self-template representation of self-assembled iron-modulated cobalt-nickel phosphide (Fe-CoNiP) grown on 3D-nickel foam (NF) using a facile amine hydrolysis-approached synergetic phosphorylation strategy. Due to its unique vertically standing self-template hierarchical nanoarrays and atomic modulated multicomponent system, these Fe-CoNiP nanoarchitectures exhibit excellent electrocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with very low applied overpotentials of 110 and 280 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2), respectively, and an overpotential value of 390 mV (J(10)) obtained for overall water splitting overtakes most precious-metal/phosphide-based electrocatalysts in an alkaline medium. Moreover, the rationally cocrystallized Fe-CoNiP binder-free electrocatalyst as a multifunctional electrode has robust physicochemical stability above 2 days with very little degradation during alkaline electrolysis. These demonstrated results may lead to new insights into constructing an alternative electrocatalyst with hierarchical nanoarchitecture to boost the overall water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	7			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000704295900025

In this study, we used a conventional sol-gel method to synthesize lead-free rhombohedral R3c bismuth sodium titanate (BNT) particles of various sizes. When used as a piezocatalyst to generate H-2 through water splitting, the BNT samples provided high production rates (up to 506.70 smol g(-1) h(-1)). These piezocatalysts also degraded the organic pollutant methylene blue (MB, 20 mg L-1) with high efficiency (up to k = 0.039 min(-1)), suggesting their potential to treat polluted water. Finally, we found that the piezopotential caused band tilting in the semiconductor and aided charge transfer such that recombination was suppressed and the rate of H-2 production increased. The mechanism of piezoelectric catalysis involved oxygen vacancies, the size of the catalyst, and the internal electric field playing important roles to enhance electron-hole which further enhanced the reactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000835469300001	35905439

In these cathodes, Li2CO3 decomposes to CO2 when exposed to potentials above 3.8V vs. Li/Li+. However, O-2 evolution, as would be expected according to the decomposition reaction 2Li(2)CO(3)4Li(+)+4e(-)+2CO(2)+O-2, is not detected. O atoms are thus unaccounted for, which was previously ascribed to unidentified parasitic reactions. Here, we show that highly reactive singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) forms upon oxidizing Li2CO3 in an aprotic electrolyte and therefore does not evolve as O-2. These results have substantial implications for the long-term cyclability of batteries: they underpin the importance of avoiding O-1(2) in metal-O-2 batteries, question the possibility of a reversible metal-O-2/CO2 battery based on a carbonate discharge product, and help explain the interfacial reactivity of transition-metal cathodes with residual Li2CO3.									138	4	0	0	3	0	139			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000431035500064	29543372

Herein, a "one-pot" colloidal approach has been used to develop a rod-shaped one-dimensional non-noble metal FeCoP electrocatalyst, which exhibits an excellent OER activity with an exceptionally high current density of 950 mA cm(-2), a turnover frequency value of 7.43 s(-1), and a low Tafel slope value of 54 mV dec(-1). The FeCoP electrocatalyst affords OER ultralow overpotentials of 230 and 260 mV at current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, in 1.0 M KOH, and demonstrates a superior catalytic stability of 10,000 cycles and durability up to 60 h at 50 mA cm(-2). An insight into the superior and stable electrocatalytic OER performance by the FeCoP nanorods is obtained by extensive Xray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman and infrared spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry analyses for a mechanistic study. This reveals that a high number of electrocatalytically active sites enhance the oxygen evolution and kinetics by offering metal ion sites for utilitarian in situ surface formation and adsorption of *O, *OH, and *OOH reactive species for OER catalysis.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000746689100001	35060716

Here, we show that highly crystalline and nonagglomerated colloidal CuCo2S4 nanoparticles can be synthesized in solution at 200 degrees C, which is significantly lower than previously reported methods. The CuCo2S4 nanoparticles were found to be highly active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under strongly alkaline conditions (1.0 M KOH, pH 14), requiring an OER overpotential of 395 mV to produce a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies showed evidence of oxide formation, suggesting, in conjunction with the observed electrocatalytic properties, that the mixed-metal sulfides may serve as precursors to oxides and/or hydroxides, which are likely to be the catalytically active species.									58	1	0	0	1	0	58			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000367706100029	26671642

The addition of minute amounts of iridium and ruthenium to the cathode enhances the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during start-up/shutdown events, thus lowering the peak cell voltage closer to the onset of water oxidation. The catalyst loadings ranged from 1 to 10 mu g/cm(2), but showed surprisingly high activity and durability. At such low loadings, it is possible to fully integrate the OER catalysts with negligible interference on fuel cell performance and a marginal increase in catalyst cost.

We have developed a new type of photocatalysis system that can split water into H-2 and O-2 under visible light irradiation, which was inspired by the two-step photoexcitation (Z-scheme) mechanism of natural photosynthesis in green plants. In this system, the water splitting reaction is broken up into two stages: one for H-2 evolution and the other for O-2 evolution; these are combined by using a shuttle redox couple (Red/Ox) in the solution. The introduction of a Z-scheme mechanism reduces the energy required to drive each photocatalysis process, extending the usable wavelengths significantly (similar to 660 nm for H-2 evolution and similar to 600 nm for O-2 evolution) from that in conventional water splitting systems (similar to 460 nm) based on one-step photoexcitation in single semiconductor material.

As the literature reports a wide range of behaviours, initial repetitive cyclic voltammetry in 1 M KOH was compared to 30 wt% KOH (i.e., that used in alkaline water electrolysers) and it was found that a process in addition to the normal alpha-Ni(OH)(2)/gamma-NiOOH and beta-Ni(OH)(2)/beta-NiOOH occurs in the more concentrated electrolyte. It is also confirmed that the initial hydroxide layer formed anodically from metallic nickel is not alpha-Ni(OH)(2), but a layer which is more readily reducible than alpha-Ni(OH)(2). At higher potentials, while in-situ XAS suggested that gamma-NiOOH is not transformed to any further phase up to 0.665 V vs HgHgO in 1 M KOH, after extensive OER (at least 40 hrs) in 30 wt% at 50 mA cm(-2), an additional phase can be identified by cyclic voltammetry. Overall, during galvanostatic oxygen evolution, the nickel anodes follow an ageing behaviour characterised by a brief activation period, a short period of high activity (i.e., low overpotential) followed by deactivation and eventually stable but poor activity. While no clear evidence was obtained to identify the most active phase for oxygen evolution, it is likely that this is related to beta-NiOOH and confined to the very surface of the electrode.

The surface properties have been investigated by voltammetric curves, the electrocatalytic activity by using O2 evolution from 1 mol dm-3 HClO4 solutions as a test reaction. It has been observed that only the surface area changes at intermediate compositions as a result of morphological modifications, while the electrocatalytic activity increases dramatically as the substitution of SnO2 for TiO2 becomes complete. Reasons for that are discussed. The present results do not support the claim that SnO2 depresses the electrocatalytic activity of oxide electrodes for oxygen evolution.									49	0	0	0	0	1	49			0021-891X			WOS:A1991GG99100004

Reasonable design of suitable catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction is conducive to the wideranging application of water splitting. Double metallic composite is superior to single-metal and non-metal materials due to the unique electronic configuration. In this work, we synthesized a Fe-Co-Se catalyst on carbon cloth (Fe-Co-Se/CC) for HER and OER. Fe-Co- Se/CC shows an overpotential of 131 mV@10 mA cm-2, 177 mV@100 mA cm-2 and 215 mV@500 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M HClO4 for HER and 300 mV@100 mA cm-2, 365 mV@500 mA cm-2 and 416 mV@1000 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH for OER. Fe-Co-Se/CC also exhibits excellent stability in HER and OER measurements.

Integration of active hollow nanostructures with functionalized carbon nanofibers synergizes the electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility, which are particularly of interest for all-solid-state zinc-air batteries (FASS ZABs). In the present work, we demonstrate that the electrospinning of Prussian blue analogs can give rise to hollow FeCo alloy nanoparticles assembled in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (h-FeCo alloy/N-CNFs). The h-FeCo alloy/N-CNFs thus derived exhibit superior bifunctional activities for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and impressive performance in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. When integrated into a rechargeable FASS ZAB, they exhibit a high open circuit voltage of 1.335 V and a stable discharge-charge plateau around 1.1 V to 2.0 V, together with a large voltage efficiency of 63.5%, under bending conditions.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			2398-4902			WOS:000526855200016

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a convenient, stable, and eco-friendly route for producing hydrogen whose performance can be enhanced via the rational structure design of catalysts and the replacement of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Herein, 3D hierarchically structured NiMo microrod arrays was constructed on Ni foam where ZnO served as core and support (NiMo@ZnO/NF), which showed a high activity when used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the HER and UOR. It only required potentials of -110 mV and 1.405 V to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) towards HER and UOR, respectively. NiMo@ZnO/NF was used as both the anode and cathode to construct a symmetric electrolyzer that was used for water splitting and urea electrolysis. The cell voltage decreased from 1.718 V to 1.549 V at 10 mA cm(-2) after substituting the OER with UOR. Finally, the coupled NiMo@ZnO/NF parallel to NiMo@ZnO/NF system can be driven by an AA battery in an alkaline solution containing urea, which demonstrates a practical and effective method for producing hydrogen assisted by anodic urea oxidation.

The alkaline battery environment is however vulnerable to electrolyte carbonation by atmospheric CO2 resulting in capacity loss over time. The acid aqueous solution is immune to carbonation but is limited by the lack of effective non-noble metal catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This is contrary to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acid solution where a few good candidates exist. We report here the development of a N-Co-O triply doped carbon catalyst with substantial OER activity in acid solution by the thermal codecomposition of polyaniline, cobalt salt and cyanamide in nitrogen. Cyanamide and the type of cobalt precursor salt were found to determine the structure, crystallinity, surface area, extent of Co doping and consequently the OER activity of the final carbon catalyst in acid solution. We have also put forward some hypotheses about the active sites that may be useful for guiding further work.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000370211400073	26795393

However, they generally exhibit low efficiency and lack the ability to utilize long-wavelength photons in a photocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here, based on first-principles calculations, we reveal that the two-dimensional (2D) aza-fused conjugated microporous polymer (aza-CMP) with a honeycomb network is a semiconductor with novel layer-dependent electronic properties. The bandgap of the as-synthesized aza-CMP nanosheets is measured to be 1.22 eV, suggesting that they can effectively boost light absorption in the visible and near infrared (NIR) region. More importantly, aza-CMP also possesses a valence band margin suitable for a photocatalytic OER. Taking advantage of the 2D layered nanostructure, we further show that the exfoliated ultrathin aza-CMP nanosheets can exhibit a three-fold enhancement in the photocatalytic OER. After deposition of a Co(OH)(2) cocatalyst, the hybrid Co( OH)(2)/aza-CMP photocatalyst exhibits a markedly improved performance for photocatalytic O-2 evolution. Furthermore, first-principles calculations reveal that the photocatalytic O-2 evolution reaction is energetically feasible for aza-CMP nanosheets under visible light irradiation. Our findings reveal that nanostructured polymers hold great potential for photocatalytic applications with efficient solar energy utilization.									87	9	0	0	4	0	90			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000397966400007	28294255

Here, a novel superhydrophilic Co4N-CeO(2)hybrid nanosheet array is synthesized on a graphite plate (Co4N-CeO2/GP) by an anion intercalation enhanced electrodeposition method, followed by high-temperature nitridation. Doping CeO(2)into Co4N can favor dissociation of H2O and adsorption of hydrogen, reduce the energy barrier of intermediate reactions of OER, and improve the compositional stability, thereby dramatically boosting the HER performance while simultaneously inducing enhanced OER activity. Furthermore, the superhydrophilic self-supported electrode with Co4N-CeO(2)in situ grown on the conductive substrate expedites electron conduction between substrate and catalyst, promotes the bubble release from electrode timely and impedes catalyst shedding, ensuring a high efficiency and stable working state. Consequently, the Co4N-CeO2/GP electrode shows exceptionally low overpotentials of 24 and 239 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)for HER and OER, respectively. An alkaline electrolyzer by using Co4N-CeO2/GP as both the cathode and anode requires a cell voltage of 1.507 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the Pt/C||RuO(2)electrolyzer (1.540 V@10 mA cm(-2)). More significantly, the electrolyzer has extraordinary long-term durability at a large current density of 500 mA cm(-2)for 50 h, revealing its potential in large-scale applications.									154	6	0	0	11	0	156			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000539577300001

We report here a first-principles density functional theory study of the chemical dynamics of the first proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), which is considered responsible for the large OER overpotential on TiO2. We use a periodic model of the TiO2/water interface that includes a slab of anatase TiO2 and explicit water molecules, sample the solvent configurations by first principles molecular dynamics, and determine the energy profiles of the two electronic states involved in the electron transfer (ET) by hybrid functional calculations. Our results suggest that the first PCET is sequential, with the ET following the proton transfer. The ET occurs via an inner sphere process, which is facilitated by a state in which one electronic hole is shared by the two oxygen ions involved in the transfer.									120	4	0	0	10	0	121			0002-7863			WOS:000328865100018	24308541

Herein, ultrathin CoP nanosheets (CoP NS) as durable bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting are reported. The OER and HER activity for CoP NS/C reaching 10 mA cm(-2) needs an overpotential of only 0.277 V and 0.111 V in a basic solution. What's more, when integrated into a practical anion exchange membrane water electrolysis cell using CoP NS as both anode and cathode catalysts, a current density of 335 mA cm(-2) at 1.8 V is achieved, which is rather competitive to the state-of-the-art Pt/IrO2 catalyst. This work would open a new avenue to explore the use of transition metal phosphides as green and attractive bifunctional catalysts toward mass production of hydrogen fuel for applications.									88	5	0	0	0	0	89			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000374413300003

Hence there is a need to develop robust catalysts to eliminate barriers associated with sluggish kinetics associated with both anodic oxygen and cathodic hydrogen evolution reactions. Herein, we report a two-step nanocasting-solid phase phosphorization approach to generate ordered mesoporous triphasic phosphides CoP@Cu2P-Cu3P. We show that it is a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst useful for overall water splitting. The mesoporous triphasic CoP@Cu2P-Cu3P only requires a low overpotential of 255 mV and 188 mV to achieve 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, respectively. The combination of mesoporous pores (similar to 5.6 nm) with very thin walls (similar to 3.7 nm) and conductive networks in triphasic CoP@Cu2P-Cu3P enable rapid rate of electron transfer and mass transfer. In addition, when CoP@Cu2P-Cu3P is used to fabricate symmetric electrodes, the high surface area mesoporous structure and synergetic effects between phases together contribute to a low cell voltage of 1.54 V to drive a current density 10 mA cm(-2). This performance is superior to noble-metal-based Pt/C-IrO2/C. This work provides a new approach for the facile design and application of multiphase phosphides as highly active bifunctional and stable electrocatalysts for water-alkali electrolyzers.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			2398-4902			WOS:000626710500006

The effect of the surface temperature as well as the influence of changes in the methanol and atomic oxygen flux on the partial oxidation to methyl formate was studied. A maximum in methyl formate formation is observed at 250 K under the applied single collision conditions. Increasing the methanol to oxygen ratio was found to increase the selectivity to methyl formate and decrease unwanted overoxidation to surface deactivating formate detected by in situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). The results show evidence for the importance of an additional deactivation mechanism for methyl formate formation connected to methanol which is active under oxygen-deficient conditions at low temperatures. Moreover, the measurements suggest a small number of sites to be highly reactive for methyl formate formation which are preferentially blocked under oxygen-deficient conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000745040300001

The optimum substitution ratio of Fe3+ cations was determined by electrochemical measurement of the air cathode composed of the catalyst, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder, and Vulcan XC-72 carbon. The substitution by Fe enhanced the electrochemical performances of the catalysts.

Herein, bimetallic cobalt-manganese organic framework (CMT) directly grown on a Ti3C2Tx MXene sheet via solvothermal treatment to obtain strong oxidation resistance in an open structured application and to enhance electrocatalytic properties for oxygen evolution and reduction reaction is reported. Inspired by ligand chemistry, the carboxyl acids in tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin acting as an organic linker are grafted with the surface terminators of Ti3C2Tx MXene through the Fischer esterification and substitution reaction of fluorine, thereby greatly enhancing the antioxidation stability. Furthermore, the as-formed metalloporphyrin structure and unpaired electrons, produced between CMT and Ti3C2Tx MXene during solvothermal treatment, improve their electrocatalytic activity, durability, and electrical conductivity through an electron hopping mechanism. Consequently, the CMT@MXene demonstrates high stability as a bifunctional electrocatalyst at a fixed specific capacity of 1000 mAh g(-1) and a current density of 500 mA g(-1) for 247 cycles in lithium-oxygen (Li-O-2) battery. This approach suggests new strategies for the synergistic coupling of MXenes and MOFs for future open structured applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000871902900001

Development of efficient and cost-effective OER electrocatalysts has become a high-priority research task. In this regard, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as one of the promising OER electrocatalysts have been intensely researched due to their unique 2D layered structure and excellent physicochemical properties. Herein, this review aims to summarize recent strategies to design LDHs, including nanostructuring, hybrid LDHs with conductive materials, partial substitution of cations, interlayer anion replacement, vacancy creation, and combination of computational methods and operando techniques. Specifically, a thorough literature overview in the developments of LDHs to improve OER performance is appraised in detail, based on the compositional difference of transition metal components. Challenges and future directions in designing LDHs as OER electrocatalysts are discussed. The provided discussion will be favorable to explore and develop better catalysts and device units for practical applications and will offer a basic understanding of the OER process along with key issues to evaluate the performance.									283	20	0	0	17	0	289			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463824300001

The formation of a variety of Ir Col-xOy (0 <= x <= 1) crystalline tubular nanocomposites was readily achieved by electrospinning and subsequent calcination process. Structural characterization clearly confirmed that IrxCo1-xOy polycrystalline nanocomposites had a tubular morphology consisting of Ir/IrO2 and Co3O4, where Ir, Co, and O were homogeneously distributed throughout the entire nanostructures. The facile formation of IrxCo1-xOy nanotubes was mainly ascribed to the inclination of Co3O4 to form the nanotubes during the calcination process, which could play a critical role in providing a template of tubular structure and facilitating the formation of IrO2 by being incorporated with Ir precursors. Furthermore, the electroactivity of obtained IrxCo1-xOy nanotubes was characterized for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with rotating disk electrode voltammetry in 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. Among diverse IrxCo1-xOy, Ir0.46Co0.54Oy nanotubes showed the best OER activity (the least-positive onset potential, greatest, current density, and low Tafel slope), which was even better than that of commercial Ir/C. The Ir0.46Co0.54Oy nanotubes also exhibited a high stability in alkaline electrolyte. Expensive Ir mixed with cheap Co at an optimum ratio showed a greater OER catalytic activity than pure Ir oxide, one of the most efficient OER catalysts.									42	3	0	0	3	0	43			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000413131500052	28920424

The electrocatalytic activity could be further improved with the fabricated catalyst possessing microporous structures. In this study, binder-free hydrogen bubble-assisted electrodeposition of Cu, Ni, and phosphorous over a Cu sheet (CuNiP@Cu sheet) electrode was constructed. Three electrodeposition solutions consisting of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 mole ratios of Cu to Ni and 0.50 M sodium hypophosphite were utilized to produce electrodes under a range of electrodeposition potentials from -2.0 to -9.0 V vs Hg/ Hg2SO4 so as to control the rate of hydrogen bubble template generation. The optimum performance for the OER in 1.0 M KOH solution was achieved using the electrode [i.e., CuNiP@Cu (1:1)] generated from an electrodeposition solution consisting of 1:1 mole ratio of Cu to Ni at -4.0 V vs Hg/Hg2SO4 for 5-20 min, which demonstrated a low overpotential value of 318 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm2 current density with a Tafel slope of 100 mV/dec. The potentiodynamic studies of the electrode showed minimal change in the overpotential value for the OER even after 786 cycles at a scan rate of 200 mV/s. The stability was also confirmed with the potentiostatic studies in which the electrode was found to be stable for 20 h of the experimental time. The outcomes suggest that low-cost, readily synthesized, and binder-free hydrogen bubble-assisted one-step electrodeposited microporous electrocatalysts hold excellent features toward the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000869071700001

The surface charge of active sites on catalysts modulate adsorption and desorption of intermediates. However, there is no direct evidence to bridge surface charge and catalytic activity of active sites. Defects (active sites) were created on a HOPG (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) surface that broke the intrinsic sp(2)-hybridization of graphite by plasma, inducing localization of surface charge onto defective active sites, as shown by scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). An electrochemical test revealed enhanced intrinsic activity by the localized surface charge. DFT calculations confirmed the relationship between surface charge and catalytic activity. This work correlates surface charge and catalytic activity, providing insights into electrocatalytic behavior and guiding the design of advanced electrocatalysts.									178	16	0	0	8	0	179			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000456260200009	30479055

The calcium in steel decreased from 48 to 2 ppm, and the sulfur in steel changed a little with time. When sulfur content in steel was as low as 25 ppm during calcium treatment, inclusions shifted from CaO-Al2O3-CaS to Al2O3-CaO with about 35 pct CaO. When the sulfur increased over 90 ppm, more CaS-CaO formed just after the addition of calcium, and then the CaS content decreased from over 45 pct to lower than 15 pct and inclusions were mostly Al2O3-CaO-CaS and Al2O3-CaO with a high Al2O3 content. Thermodynamic calculation predicted the variation of the composition of inclusions, indicating good agreement with the measurement, while a certain deviation existed, especially for heats with 90 and 180 ppm sulfur. A reaction model was proposed for the formation of CaO and CaS, which considered the reaction between calcium vapor bubbles in the zone and the dissolved oxygen and sulfur in the molten steel, as described by a Langmuir-type adsorption isotherm with a reaction occurring on the remaining vacant sites. The variation of transient CaS inclusions was discussed based on the thermodynamic calculation and the morphology evolution of typical inclusions containing CaS.									25	3	0	0	1	0	26			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000426808500015

It is important to boost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to produce more hydrogen. High-entropy compounds are a potential category of electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their outstanding reactivity and stability. Noble metal-free high-entropy FeCoNiMn (oxy)hydroxide was synthesized over a large area of 100 cm2 on nickel foam using a facile approach of one-step electrodeposition. High-entropy FeCoNiMnOOH led to outstanding OER activity with a low overpotential of 282 mV at current density of 100 mA cm-2 and showed excellent performance at room temperature as determined by the stability test for over 200 h at a high current density of 500 mA cm-2 in 1.0 M KOH. Under quasi-industrial condition of using 6.0 M KOH solution at 333 K, only 1.64 V was required to reach a high current density of 3000 mA cm-2. In addition, the high-entropy catalyst maintained its stability at a high current density of 1000 mA cm-2 for over 40 h, suggesting its suitability for practical application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0959-6526	1879-1786		WOS:000804682300003

In this study, phosphorus-doped carbon nanoparticles (P-CNPs) were synthesized by spray pyrolysis method in chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The synthesized P-CNPs were used as electron carrier support materials for the preparation of P-CNPs-supported palladium (Pd/P-CNPs) electrocatalyst and also used as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrode in PEM water electrolysis. These synthesized Pd/P-CNPs were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and cyclic voltammetry methods. The membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated using Pd/P-CNPs as a cathode catalyst for the HER and RuO2 as the anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated MEA electrochemical performances along with their corresponding yields of hydrogen production were evaluated in PEM water electrolyzer single cell assemblies at various experimental conditions. The obtained results showed that the synthesized Pd/P-CNPs observed a current density of 1 A cm(-2) at 2 V at 80 A degrees C. Further, long-term stability tested for up to 500 h continuously and showed the reasonable stability with similar electrochemical activity compared to commercial Pt/CB. Hence, the synthesized Pd/P-CNPs could be used as the alternative to Pt-based catalysts for HER.									15	0	0	0	2	0	15			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000445155700020

Here, we rationally designed Co(OH)(2)@CoSe nanorods (NRs) as an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst by an in situ electrochemical transformation strategy, where the Co-based nanorod template was converted into Co(OH)(2)@CoSe at the cathode. The obtained electrode exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity for both the HER (overpotential of 208 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) and the OER (268 mV at 20 mA cm(-2)) at high current density in a 1 M KOH solution. The theoretical calculations and experimental evidence indicate that the chemical coupling Co-OH active site between Co(OH)(2) and CoSe regulates the hydrogen adsorption and desorption energy and fast electron transfer capability, which is responsible for the improved HER. Moreover, the Co(OH)(2)@CoSe NRs can be further converted into CoOOH nanosheets which serve as OER active sites. Toward practical electrolytic cell applications, the Co(OH)(2)@CoSe nanorods as both the cathode and anode achieved a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.94 V for overall water splitting, better than that of noble metal-based electrocatalysts.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			2516-0230			WOS:000517128400021	36133248

However, the changes in crystallinity of MOFs related to the composition manipulation have seldom been explored for the catalytic OER activity. Herein, we realize the controllable amorphization engineering on CoxFeyMOFs from crystalline to amorphous state by deliberately adjusting the ratio of Co/Fe precursors introduced within the MOFs. While crystalline MOFs are formed with initially dominating the contribution of Co ions, amorphous MOFs are obtained when the amount of Fe ions exceeds 60%. Theoretical findings propose that the defects formation energies of CoxFey-MOFs can be dramatically reduced with the decrease of Co/Fe ratio, which make the long-range disorder structure be readily formed with abundant defects. The disorder structure and the tunable ratio of Co/Fe enable to endow the bimetallic CoxFey-MOFs with abundant active sites and fast charge transfer, thus boosting the catalytic activity towards OER. It is found that the optimized amorphous Co4Fe6-MOF can deliver the current density of 10 mA cm-2 only at a low overpotential of 241 mV with extremely small Tafel slope of 30.1 mV dec-1. The present work enriches the understanding on the crystalline-to-amorphous transformations and sheds light on the way for the applications of amorphous MOFs nanomaterials in water splitting field.									18	2	0	0	0	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000655675900004

Herein boron-doped cobalt-iron bimetal phosphides nanosheets as OER electrocatalysts have been successfully prepared by hydrothermal boronation of bimetallic metal-organic frameworks precursors with the subsequent low-temperature phosphidation. The synergistic effect between non-metal elements (B and P) and metals (Co and Fe) is found to play an important role on tuning the local electronic configuration surrounding the active metal centers. Moreover, the resultant nanosheet structures are beneficial for exposing the catalytically active sites and facilitating the mass/charge transport. As expected, the optimal catalyst exhibits superior catalytic performance toward the OER with long-term durability in 1.0 M KOH, affording a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at low over-potential of 294 mV and small Tafel slope of 49.5 mV dec(-1).

Herein, we report active and robust OER catalysts of Fe3+-doped beta-Ni(OH)2 prepared via an atomic-scale topochemical transformation route. Based on the premise that all Fe3+ is incorporated into the beta-Ni(OH)2 lattice, the OER activity increases directly with the content of Fe3+. The Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)2 catalyst affords a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at an overpotential as low as 0.26 V and a small Tafel slope of 32 mv dec-1. Comparing the state-of-the-art IrO2 catalyst, the Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)2 catalyst exhibits higher activity and stability from galvanostatic tests at 10 mA cm-2. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate that Fe(0.5)-doped beta-Ni(OH)2 exerts higher OER activity than Fe(0.5)-doped a-Ni(OH)2. All evidence indicates that Fe and the beta-Ni(OH)2 matrix play an important role in NiFe-based catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488			INSPEC:17628184

Metal oxides comprise the most promising class of photoanode materials, but no known material meets the demanding photoelectrochemical requirements. Copper vanadates have recently been identified as a promising class of photoanode materials with several phases exhibiting an indirect band gap near 2 eV and stable photoelectrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction in a pH 9.2 electrolyte. By employing combinatorial inkjet printing of metal precursors and applying both calcination and rapid thermal processing, we characterize the phase behaviour of the entire CuO-V2O5 composition space for different thermal treatments via automated analysis of approximately 100 000 Raman spectra acquired using a novel Raman imaging technique. These results enable the establishment of structure-property relationships for optical absorption and photoelectrochemical properties, revealing that highly active photoelectrocatalysts containing alpha-Cu2V2O7 or alpha-CuV2O6 can be prepared using scalable solution processing techniques. An additional discovery results from the formation of an off-stoichiometric beta-Cu2V2O7 material that exhibits high photoelectroactivity in the presence of a ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple with excellent stability in a pH 13 electrolyte, demonstrating that copper vanadates may be viable photoanodes in strong alkaline electrolytes.									47	1	0	0	4	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000376035300049

Besides being scalable, cheap, and time-efficient, the demonstrated procedure is based on earth-abundant and non-hazardous materials only. Oxidation of mixed-valence Fe2+/Fe3+ GR to GR* was achieved by chemical and electrochemical processes. The latter induces less grafting of interlayer CO32-, leading to less contraction of the interlayer space and a reduction in the observable stacking disorder. The direct electrodeposition of the catalyst on a conductive substrate enabled the first systematic study of the impact of grafting on the performance of GR* in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The materials subjected to chemical (GR*(ChOx)) and electrochemical oxidation (GR*(ElOx)) allowed obtaining a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at 1.82 V and 1.84 V, respectively, thus improving the electrocatalytic capabilities and outperforming the bare steel substrate operated in 1 M KOH solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2633-5409		WOS:000681292100001

The hierarchical structure of the CaTiO3 samples involved single-crystal nanowires growing respectively along the [110], [1 (1) over bar0] and [001] direction and intersecting each other perpendicularly which further featured a high specific surface area and oxygen vacancies. This material was able to split water into H-2 under visible light irradiation. It was found that oxygen vacancies formed an impurity level at an energy level 0.95 eV below the conduction band acted as electron donors and promoted charge transport and separation.

Herein, we demonstrate a reductive electrosynthesis approach to prepare a layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled trimetallic Fe-Co-Ni metal-organic framework (MOF) in which the metal cations within each layer or at the interface of the two layers are linked to one another by bridging 2-amino-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid linkers. Tailoring catalytically active sites in an LbL fashion affords a highly porous material that exhibits excellent trifunctional electrocatalytic activities toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (eta(j=10) = 116 mV), oxygen evolution reaction (eta(j=10) = 254 mV), as well as oxygen reduction reaction (half-wave potential = 0.75 V vs reference hydrogen electrode) in alkaline solutions. The dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations suggest that the prominent catalytic activity of the LbL MOF toward the HER, OER, and ORR is due to the initial negative adsorption energy of water on the metal nodes and the elongated O-H bond length of the H2O molecule. The Fe-Co-Ni MOF-based Zn-air battery exhibits a remarkable energy storage performance and excellent cycling stability of over 700 cycles that outperform the commercial noble metal benchmarks. When assembled in an asymmetric device configuration, the activated carbonliFe-Co-Ni MOF supercapacitor provides a superb specific energy and a power of up to 56.2 W h kg(-1) and 42.2 kW kg(-1), respectively. This work offers not only a novel approach to prepare an LbL assembled multimetallic MOF but also provides a benchmark for a multifunctional electrocatalyst for water splitting and Zn-air batteries.									20	0	0	0	2	0	20			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000773646200013	35167746

Here, density functional theory calculations were performed to investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performances of double metal carbide MXenes (Cr2TiC2O2 and the Mo2TiC2O2 monolayer (ML) modified by a single transition metal (TM) atom (Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt, Au, or Hg)). The thermodynamic stabilities of TM adatoms on pristine Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 MLs and defective Cr2TiC2O2 and Mo2TiC2O2 MLs with oxygen vacancies (denoted as TM-M'(2) TiC2O2-delta, where M' = Cr or Mo) were calculated, and the results indicated that the introduction of oxygen vacancies can increase the stabilities of TM adatoms. The TM modification on the MXenes surface tuned the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption Delta G(H), and the Delta G(H) values of Au-, Co-Cr2TiC2O2-delta, and Ni-Mo2TiC2O2-delta closed to zero values (0.07, -0.07, and 0.02 eV, respectively). The presence of TM adatoms also changed the reaction mechanism of H-2 desorption and reduced the activation barrier for H-2 production to improve the catalytic efficiency. Nine TM-M'2TiC2O2-delta systems were found to have both HER activity and a lower H-2 desorption reaction barrier than the pristine MXenes. Systematic electronic structure analyses showed that charge rearrangement through TM modification could tune the number of electrons gained by the surface O atom and have an impact on the hydrogen adsorption strength. These results indicated that TM surface modification is an effective method for improving the HER catalytic activity of double TM carbides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000852034900001

Herein, FeNi LDH/V2CTx/nickel foam (NF) self-supported bifunctional electrode was prepared via deposition of FeNi LDH on V2CTx/NF substrate by hydrothermal method. Strong interfacial interaction between V2CTx/NF and FeNi LDH effectively prevented the aggregation of FeNi LDH, thus exposing more catalytic active sites, which improved electrical conductivity of the nanohybrids and structural stability. The results indicated that the prepared FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF required 222 mV and 151 mV overpotential for OER and HER in 1 M KOH to provide 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Besides, the FeNi LDH/V2CTx/NF electrocatalysts were applied to overall water splitting, which achieved a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 1.74 V.

Herein, Mo2C@g-C3N4@NiMn-LDH, a bifunctional electrocatalyst, is obtained through self-assembly strategies of heat treatment, g-C3N4 coating, and hydrothermal growth of NiMn-LDH nanosheets using homogeneous Mo2C precursor nanowire as template. Specifically, Mo2C and NiMn-LDH are located on the inner wall and outer wall of g-C3N4, respectively, realizing separate-sided different functions of g-C3N4 by electronic control of the interface. The Mo2C@g-C3N4@NiMn-LDH composite exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, in which the inner Mo2C@g-C3N4 are the dominant catalytic active center for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the outer NiMn-LDH acts as co-catalyst, whereas the active center transfer to g-C3N4@NiMn-LDH for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the inner Mo2C turns into the co-catalyst. The performance of Mo2C@g-C3N4@NiMn-LDH electrocatalyst is reflected by the overpotential of 116 mV (for HER) and 290 mV (for OER) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline medium, respectively. In addition, the voltage required for overall water splitting to reach 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.587 V, and the sample has excellent stability under constant applied voltage.

Herein, amorphous cobalt-iron hydroxide (CoFe-H) nanosheets are synthesized by facile electrodeposition as an efficient catalyst for both electrochemical and PEC water oxidation. As a result of the high electrochemically active surface area and the amorphous nature, the optimized amorphous CoFe-H nanosheets exhibit superior OER catalytic activity in alkaline environment with a small overpotential (280 mV) to achieve significant oxygen evolution (j = 10 mA cm(-2)) and a low Tafel slope (28 mV dec(-1)). Furthermore, CoFe-H nanosheets are simply integrated with BiVO4 semiconductor to construct CoFe- H/BiVO4 photoanodes that exhibit a significantly enhanced photocurrent density of 2.48 mA cm(-2) (at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a much lower onset potential of 0.23 V (vs RHE) for PEC-OER. Careful electrochemical and optical studies reveal that the improved OER kinetics and high-quality interface at the CoFe-H/BiVO4 junction, as well as the excellent optical transparency of CoFe. H nanosheets, contribute to the high PEC performance. This study establishes amorphous CoFe. H nanosheets as a highly competitive candidate for electrochemical and PEC water oxidation and provides general guidelines for designing efficient PEC systems.									241	17	0	0	7	0	242			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000398572600001

Among various material candidates, metal sulfides are receiving increasing attention. While morphology-dependent catalytic performances are well established in noble metal-based catalysts, relatively little is known for the morphology-catalytic performance relationship in metal sulfide catalysts. In this study, uniform spider web-like Ni nanosheets-Ni3S2 and honeycomb-like Ni3S2 structures are deposited on nickel foam (Ni3S2/NF) by a facile one-step hydrothermal synthetic route. When used as an oxygen evolution electrode, the spider web-like Ni-Ni3S2/NF with the large exposed surface area shown excel lent catalytic activity and stability with an overpotential of similar to 310 mV to achieve at 10 mA/cm(2) and a Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec in alkaline media, which is superior to the honeycomb-like structure without Ni nanosheet. The low Tafel slope of the spider web-like Ni-Ni3S2/NF represents one of the best OER kinetics among nickel sulfide-based OER catalysts. The results point to the fact that performance of the metal sulfide electrocatalysts might be fine-tuned and optimized with morphological controls.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2196-5404			WOS:000455348100007

As an abundant natural resource, applying seawater-based electrolytes is proposed to have considerable economic and environmental benefits, and will significantly broaden the applications of metal-air batteries. However, the existence of complex components in seawater, in particular chloride ions, inevitably has a complex influence on air electrode processes, including the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER), requiring the development of efficient chloride-resistant electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, a few seawater-based metal-air battery prototypes have shown great application potential but are still at an early stage of development. In this review, we first propose the concept of seawater-based metal-air batteries and comprehensively analyze the essential air electrode reactions in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. Subsequently, rational design strategies for ORR and OER electrocatalysts suitable for use in chloride-containing and seawater-based electrolytes are comprehensively discussed. Moreover, the development history and potential applications of seawater-based metal-air batteries are demonstrated. Finally, a summary and outlook are provided for future innovations.									55	3	0	0	4	0	56			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000579868500004

Herein, a FeOOH/Ag/BiVO4 photoanode was constructed, where Ag could greatly enhance the light absorption efficiency and charge separation efficiency, while FeOOH could effectively expedite the water oxidation kinetics. In addition to their respective roles, a strong electronic interaction between Ag and FeOOH could further accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. Consequently, the water oxidation photocurrent of this photoanode material achieves 3.19 mA cm(-2) (1.23 V versus RHE), which is about 3.22 times higher than BiVO4, and shows a notable increase from 0.23% to 1.0% for the applied bias photo-to-current efficiency. In summary, our work provides a deep insight into the modification of photoanode with both noble metal and oxygen evolution catalyst to improve the photoelectrochemical performance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-0230			WOS:000681214200005

Renewable hydrogen, as a promising energy carrier, is closely related to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the OER kinetics is slow due to the slow 4e(-) transfer process. The low-cost transition metal-based catalysts provide broad prospects for the development of efficient and stable OER catalysts. Designing an efficient transition metal-based OER catalyst is beneficial to improve the overall efficiency of water decomposition. Here, we developed a new three-dimensional carbonized polyaniline fiber material loaded with Fe-Co oxide nanoparticle (denoted as 3D-CPF/FeCoOx-Nanoparticles) material by doping Fe to activate the catalytic activity of cobalt-based catalysts, introducing new reaction pathways and using the synergistic enhancement between metal nanoparticles and carbonized polyaniline fibers. Benefiting from the synergistic enhancement of the conductive three-dimensional carbonized polyaniline fibers and the high catalytic activity of FeCoOx nanoparticles, the 3D-CPF/FeCoOx-Nanoparticles only need a potential of 1.63 V to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Excitingly, the 3D-CPF/FeCoOx-Nanoparticles have exhibited potential applications in supercapacitors.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000605477500033

In this work, CoFe2O4/oxygen-doped graphitic carbon nitrogen (O-C3N4) was synthesized by glycine-nitrate combustion method, which has many advantages such as high compositional homogeneity and fine particle size. O-C3N4 as a support possessing abundant oxygenated functional groups can provide more active sites for anchoring metal ions, and effectively avoid or minimize the growth and aggregation of CoFe2O4 NPs. As a result, CoFe2O4 NPs with a number-mean particle size of 5.06 +/- 0.42 nm were homogeneously fabricated on the surface of O-C3N4. Moreover, the performance of catalysis was estimated using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as a model system. The OER performance was remarkably improved including long-term stability and the overpotential of CoFe2O4/O-C3N4 hybrid for 10 mA/cm(2) current densities with a decrease of 131 mV and 61 mV compared with CoFe2O4 and CoFe2O4/graphitic carbon nitrogen (g-C3N4) hybrid, respectively. These indicate that oxygenated functional groups on O-C3N4 not only leads to homogeneous distribution of CoFe2O4 NPs, but also improves the performance for OER. Finally, O-C3N4 could act as a novel support to enhance the dispersion of NPs for the further application in catalysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

H-1-NMR, FT-IR, UV-Vis, and MS data were acquired to characterize the synthesized compounds. Voltammetric and in situ spectroelectrochemical measurements shed light on the redox properties of the metallophthalocyanines (MPcs) in order to show the influence of the metal cations and thiazole-bearing substituents. In solution, the redox processes had an influence to the electrochromic responses, which were examined with in situ spectrocolorimetry. Phthalocyanines having cobalt (II), manganese (III), iron (III), and zinc (II) at the center yielded characteristic redox couples which are metal- and/or Pc-based and which are harmonious with the common redox properties of these types of compounds. In situ spectroelectrochemistry provided the information that MPc species underwent distinct color changes during electron transfer reactions. Electropolymerization of all complexes was performed on glassy carbon electrode, and the electropolymerized film of FePc was evaluated as an active electrocatalyst, in the alkaline medium, for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000749301600002

Herein, a core-shell (CS) NiFeCr metal/metal hydroxide catalyst was fabricated on a 3D Cu nanoarray by a simple electrodeposition-activation method. A synergistic promotion effect between electronic structure modulation and nanostructure regulation was presented on a CS-NiFeCr oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst: the 3D nanoarchitecture facilitates the mass transport process, the in situ formed interface metal/metal hydroxide heterojunction accelerates the electron transfer, and the electronic structure modulation by Cr incorporation improves the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the synergy between structural and electronic modulation, the catalyst shows excellent activity toward water oxidation under alkaline conditions: overpotential of 200 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) current density and Tafel slope of 28 mV/dec. This work opens up a new window for understanding the structure-activity relationship of OER catalysts and encourages new strategies for development of more advanced OER catalysts.									75	4	0	0	4	0	76			2380-8195			WOS:000453805100003

Herein, a Co-engineered FeOOH catalyst integrated on carbon fiber paper (Co-FeOOH/CFP) is reported, which realized a great improvement of the oxygen evolution activity by tuning the coordination geometry of the Fe species with an electrochemically driven method. Experiments and theoretical calculation demonstrate that the FeO bonds of FeOOH are partially broken, which is rooted in the Co incorporation, thus resulting in unsaturated FeO6 ligand structures and a relatively narrow bandgap. Consequently, the reorganized Fe sites on the surface show an enhanced capability for adsorbing OH- species and the Co-FeOOH exhibits an improved conductivity. As expected, the Co-FeOOH/CFP hybrids exhibit an extremely low overpotential of approximate to 250 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope, which far outperforms that of electrochemically sluggish FeOOH. The present work emphasizes the importance of local Fe coordination in catalysis and provides an in-depth insight into the mechanism of the enhanced catalytic activity.									43	2	0	0	2	0	44			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000472199500017	30957431

When utilized as a 3D catalyst electrode for the OER in 1.0 M KHCO3 (pH: 8.3), as-formed CoCH/NF demands overpotential of only 332 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 130 h.

Transition-metal (TM) hydroxide nanosheets with high-valent TM ions possess high intrinsic catalytic activity toward OER. Herein, by taking advantage of the inductive effect, this work presents a facile and universal strategy to fabricate atomic iridium (Ir) incorporated TM hydroxide nanosheets as highly active OER electrocatalysts. As a representative, the fabricated Ir-Ni(OH)(2) (4 wt% Ir) exhibits remarkable OER performance with a low overpotential (235 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)), a small Tafel slope (58.4 mV dec(-1)), and excellent durability (60 h) in alkaline solution, significantly outperforming the benchmark IrO2 and Ni(OH)(2). Mechanism studies unveil that the inductive effect between Ni and Ir endows Ni(OH)(2) with high-valent Ni species, which facilitate the adsorption of nucleophilic intermediates and boost the OER activity and long-term stability of Ir-Ni(OH)(2). More importantly, the reported strategy could be extended to synthesize other monometallic/bimetallic TM hydroxide nanosheets (Co, CoMn) as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts. This work should pave a universal and promising avenue to rationally design and controllably synthesize efficient yet robust OER electrocatalysts in energy-related fields.									30	1	0	0	3	0	30			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000537392600007

However, conventional OER catalysts are of low electrochemical efficiency while the state-of-the-art nanoparticle-based catalysts require mechanical supports, thereby limiting their wide deployment. Here, it is demonstrated that, due to the excellent corrosion resistance of the Fe-Co-Ni-Cr-Nb high entropy intermetallic Laves phase, fabricating a high entropy bulk porous nanostructure is possible by dealloying the corresponding eutectic alloy precursor. As a result, a core-shell nanostructure with amorphous high entropy oxide ultrathin films wrapped around the nanosized intermetallic ligaments is obtained, which together, exhibits an extraordinarily large active surface area, fast dynamics, and superb long-term durability, outperforming the existing alloy- and ceramic-based OER electrocatalysts. The outcome of the research suggests that the paradigm of "high entropy" design can be used to develop high performance catalytic materials.									69	7	0	0	4	0	69			2366-7486			WOS:000515182700001

Here, a novel, simple, and efficient routine is presented for the first time by constructing a high-efficiency anode catalyst for OER. With the aid of high intensity ultrasound, a uniformly loading, conductive multiwalled carbon nanotubes/metal/transition metal-oxide (CNTs-Au@CO3O4) tubular hybrids is synthesized. In alkaline media, the materials catalyze OER with an onset potential of 1.56 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and overpotential only of 350 mV to achieve a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for at least 25 h. The unusual catalytic activity and stability is due to the following elements. Firstly, the tubular architecture not only provides sufficient active centers for OER, but also improves rapid mass/charge transport. Secondly, Co3O4 layer protects Au nanoparticles (NPs) against detachment. In addition, we also prove that the highest electronegativity metal Au accelerate the formation of catalytic active sites of Co-IV species for OER. It is believed that this simple preparation method paves a way to fabricate a range of CNTs/metal/metal-oxide based composites as superior OER catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the commercial applications are greatly impeded due to the sluggish OER kinetics. Herein, a heterostructured Co9S8@MoS2 electrocatalyst is demonstrated by elaborately implanting polyoxometalate of PMo12 into zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs). The implantation of Mo species creates abundant Co9S8/MoS2 hetero-interfaces that could fine-tune the electrocatalytic activity of cobalt sites and thereof enhance the OER activity. Density functional theory (DFT) results prove synergetic effects between Co9S8 and MoS2 at the heterotinterfaces. The heterostructured Co9S8 @MoS2 catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 242 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) and the corresponding Tafel slope is as small as 58 mV dec-1. Based on the superior OER activity, an unbiased solar water splitting system is built by integrating perovskite solar cell with the two-electrode Co9S8 @MoS2//Pt/C, yielding a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 13.6%. This study demonstrates a new approach for cost-effective solar water splitting system toward green hydrogen production.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000787901400002

In this aim, iron based perovskite oxides with composition GdFe1-x Cu-x O-3 (0 <= x <= 0.3) have been investigated. The effect of copper doping, calcination temperature on the OER performance in alkaline media was studied. The incorporation of Cu2+ (0 <= x <= 0.3) decreases the activity of calcined electrodes at 800 degrees C from 6.33 to 2.79 mA cm(-2), while that containing 0.2 mol of copper calcined at 600 degrees C, exhibits the higher activity (9.66 mA cm(-2)) at 0.66 V. The stability study during 8 h indicates that the undoped electrode calcined at 800 degrees C, exhibits relatively a better stability of the OER performance compared to that doped with 20% of copper calcined at 600 degrees C. The achieved results show promising potential for cost-effective hydrogen generation using earth-abundant materials and cheap fabrication processes. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The low cost and durability of catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution are great importance in the design of these electrocatalysts. Here we examine the oxidation of water with nanoparticles and efficient and strong nanocomposite used as a catalyst for the electrocatalytic reaction. The alpha-Fe2O3@MoS2 nanostructure is prepared in the aqueous phase for electrocatalytic O-2 production through water oxidation. this electrocatalyst, which is synthesized through hydrothermal route, is first used in the oxidation of water. Although MoS2 nanosheets and alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles were active in the electrocatalytic reaction of oxygen production, alpha-Fe2O3@MoS2 was more efficient. An important issue for selecting molybdenum and iron ions for water oxidation is the electrical conductivity and the high surface-to-volume ratio.									6	0	0	0	3	0	6			0026-265X	1095-9149		WOS:000568764600007

However, efficient hydrogen production suffers from a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and expensive electrocatalysts. Herein, the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is combined with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to achieve energy-saving hydrogen production. The HER and MOR are co-catalyzed by a bifunctional electrocatalyst containing a NiSe/MoSe2 heterointerface on carbon cloth (NMS/CC). The electronic structure rearrangement and charge transfer at the heterointerface are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The NMS/CC electrocatalyst has outstanding MOR properties requiring a smaller potential and Tafel slope than those of the OER as well as high efficiency and stability. Energy-saving hydrogen production by the combined MOR/HER configuration can be powered by a solar cell with an output voltage of 1.5 V. The results reveal the excellent prospect of this novel strategy for zero-carbon-emission energy generation and provide insights into the coordination of electrosynthesis and electrocatalysis.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000827438000001

The electrodes were obtained by coating a nickel foam support with the oxide suspension. Optical microscopy and cyclic voltammetry were used on the electrodes characterization. The evaluation of the electrodes electrocatalytic activity, towards the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, was performed by means of steady state measurements. The reaction follows a first order kinetics, with respect to OH- concentration, with Tafel slopes close to 40 mV, for low overpotentials. Based on the apparent and real current densities it was possible to conclude that the increase on the electrode activity, when compared with the published data, is mostly related to geometric factors. This fact has been associated with the high electrode/electrolyte contact area provided by the foam nickel substrate. Synergetic effects between the Ni foam and the perovskite oxide cannot be discarded.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0872-1904			SCIELO:S0872-19042011000500004

Development of such a catalyst with comparable electrochemical performance to the standard noble metal oxide for proton exchange membrane (PEM) based water electrolysis would constitute a pioneering breakthrough in hydrogen generation by water electrolysis. In line with these goals, by exploiting a two-pronged theoretical first principles and experimental approach herein we demonstrate that a nano-structured solid solution of SnO2:10 wt% F containing only 20 at.% RuO2 [e.g. (Sn0.80Ru0.20)O-2:10F] displays a remarkably similar electrochemical activity and moreover, comparable or even much improved electrochemical stability and durability compared to pure the noble metal counterpart, RuO2. Density functional theory calculations have demonstrated direct dependence of the catalytic activity on the electronic structure peculiarities of the F-doped (Ru,Sn)O-2 which corresponds well with the experimental results.

Recently, there are growing concerns about layered double hydroxides (LDHs) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Exfoliating LDHs is an effective method to increase the reactive sites, however, a traditional liquid phase exfoliation method is usually very labor-intensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, proper heteroelement doping and edge engineering are helpful to tune the intrinsic activity of reactive sites. In this work, bulk CoFe LDHs are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets by nitrogen plasma. Meanwhile, nitrogen doping and defects are introduced into exfoliated ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets. The number of reactive sites can be increased efficiently by the formation of ultrathin CoFe LDHs nanosheets, the nitrogen dopant alters the surrounding electronic arrangement of reactive site facilitating the adsorption of OER intermediates, and the electrocatalytic activity of reactive sites can be further tuned efficiently by introducing defects which increase the number of dangling bonds neighboring reactive sites and decrease the coordination number of reactive sites. With these advantages, this electrocatalyst shows excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of 233 mV at 10 mA cm(-2).									297	20	0	0	6	0	301			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000422930400002

However, Ir- and Ru-based OER catalysts with high OER efficiency are difficult to commercialize as precious metal-based catalysts. Therefore, the study of OER catalysts, which are replaced by non-precious metals and have high activity and stability, are necessary. In this study, a copper-cobalt oxide nanosheet (CCO) electrode was synthesized by the electrodeposition of copper-cobalt hydroxide (CCOH) on Ni foam followed by annealing. The CCOH was annealed at various temperatures, and the structure changed to that of CCO at temperatures above 250 degrees C. In addition, it was observed that the nanosheets agglomerated when annealed at 300 degrees C. The CCO electrode annealed at 250 degrees C had a high surface area and efficient electron conduction pathways as a result of the direct growth on the Ni foam. Thus, the prepared CCO electrode exhibited enhanced OER activity (1.6 V at 261 mA/cm(2)) compared to those of CCOH (1.6 V at 144 mA/cm(2)), Co3O4 (1.6 V at 39 mA/cm(2)), and commercial IrO2 (1.6 V at 14 mA/cm(2)) electrodes. The optimized catalyst also showed high activity and stability under high pH conditions, demonstrating its potential as a low cost, highly efficient OER electrode material.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2079-4991		WOS:000633954300001	33800286

The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is drawing more and more attention since it can produce H-2 powered by renewable energy. Therefore, efficient and durable electrocatalysts are an urgent need. On the one hand, the high price and low reserve of noble metals hinder their further applications. On the other hand, various non-noble metal electrocatalysts cannot achieve satisfactory stability and efficiency. Thus, this paper reports a cheap and feasible way to synthesize a carbon cage-encapsulated FeNiMo compound. It exhibits the desired overpotentials of 199 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution and 246 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in an acidic solution. Besides, it exhibits similar current density loss to commercial Pt/C after 10000 CV cycles, which suggests satisfactory durability.									9	3	0	0	1	0	9				2633-5409		WOS:000613740900004

We present in situ observations of the evolution of both the solid and fluid compositions at the interface during such a replacement reaction in the model system KBr-KCl-H2O,in which a single crystal of KBr is replaced by a single crystal of KCl. The pseudomorphism is initiated by epitaxial growth at the fluid-mineral interface, when the dissolution of the parent phase results in an interfacial fluid layer that is supersaturated with respect to a different solid composition. The subsequent evolution of the coupled dissolution and growth can be related to local equilibrium defined by a Lippmann diagram. The reaction features, including the development of porosity in the new solid phase, share many characteristics of replacement reactions in nature as well as in technical applications.									168	4	0	0	7	0	169			0003-004X	1945-3027		WOS:000233486200023

Active sites consisting of two adjacent Co(IV) cations connected by bridging oxos were identified on both the (001) and (311) surfaces. Formation of the OO bond proceeds on these sites by nucleophilic attack of water on a bridging oxo. It was found that the relative turnover frequencies for the different sites are highly dependent on the overpotential, with the dual-Co site on the (311) surface being most active at medium overpotentials (0.46-0.77 V), where OO bond formation by water addition is rate limiting. A similar dual-Co site on the (001) surface is most active at low overpotentials (<0.46 V), where O-2 release is rate limiting, and a single-Co site on the (110) surface is most active at overpotentials that are high enough (>0.77 V) to form a significant concentration of highly reactive terminal Co(V)=O species. Two overpotential-dependent Sabatier relationships were identified based on the Bronsted basicity and redox potential of the active site, explaining the change in the active site with overpotential. The (311) dual-Co site that is most active in the medium overpotential range is consistent with recent experimental observations suggesting that a defect site is responsible for the observed oxygen evolution activity and that a modest concentration of superoxo intermediates is present on the surface. Importantly, we find that it is essential to consider the kinetics of the water addition and O-2 release steps rather than only the thermodynamics.									100	3	0	0	7	0	100			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000366004700019	26479891

The Fe-CoP HNSs catalyst features abundant active sites, short charge and ion transport pathways, and favorable mass transfer kinetics, which are conductive to promote the water splitting reaction. Remarkably, the Fe-CoP HNSs catalyst exhibits superior catalytic activity towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction with low overpotentials of 79 and 220 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Furthermore, the assembled Fe-CoP HNSs parallel to Fe-CoP HNSs electrolyzer needs a low cell voltage of 1.60 V to deliver 20 mA cm(-2), which is higher than many reported transition metal phosphides electrocatalysts.

Although the oxygen octahedral framework can be manipulated during synthesis, the as-grown oxygen octahedra generally remain fixed, preventing the development of adaptive behavior in electronic and ionotronic systems. Here, it is demonstrated that the oxygen octahedral framework can be dynamically and reversibly manipulated by an electric field through the coupling with oxygen vacancies. Studying model WO3 heterostructures during ionic liquid gating with a combination of in situ X-ray scattering and spectroscopy, it is shown that large changes in electronic properties can arise due to the increased flexibility of the octahedral network at high vacancy concentrations. The results describe a generic framework for the construction of dynamic systems and devices with an array of field-tunable properties.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000454124800026	30370580

The main characteristic behaviours during coal combustion, namely, temperature gradients, oxygen consumption, gaseous products, and heat release, were investigated using an experimental apparatus. Preliminary criteria for distinguishing the evolution stage of a coal fire were developed based on these characteristic behaviours. The results showed that for the Weihuliang coal, the CO/CO2 ratio could be regarded as an indicator of an extinct coal fire, and SO2 could be used to distinguish newly ignited, accelerating, or consistently burning coal fires. The heat release during the CBS, SBS, and ES was classified into three heat levels, with the first-level heat occurring during the CBS, second-level heat during the SBS, and third-level heat during the ES. A minimum value of oxygen mass flux required for ideal coal combustion was proposed to ensure the applicability of the first-order Arrhenius equation during the ES. Lastly with the oxygen supply considered, unifying the first-order Arrhenius equations (the chemical equations) during different evolution stages was put forward as an approach of model simplification.

Herein, for the first time we synthesize CoFe-alloy nanoparticles enveloped by N, P co-doped carbon nanotubes (NPMC/CoFe), through a simple route by pyrolyzing dicyandiamide complex in the presence of phytic acid. The obtained electrocatalysts possess excellent ORR (a half wave potential of 0.896 V in 0.1 M KOH) and OER (eta(10) mA cm(-2) = 310 mV in 1 M KOH) performance, respectively. The liquid-state ZABs based on the NPMC/CoFe air-cathode demonstrates a high peak power density of 146.34 mW cm(-2) and excellent durability. Specifically, flexible and button-like ZABs with impressive performances are both realized, which could power light-emitting diodes. This work offers an attractive approach to develop the nonprecious metal-based ORR/OER catalysts, and modulators for the design of performance oriented electrocatalysts for wider electrochemical energy applications.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000494885800039

These impurities have a high impact in this industry as they can be catalytic precursors of the secondary reactions that occur in the LAB performance: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). When the secondary reactions are catalyzed, the water consumption of a battery might be increased. In this way, negative effects such as the decrease of high-temperature durability and the increase of self-discharge could occur, even the safety of the battery itself could be jeopardized. Due to these facts, the aim of the present research work was to develop a quick-low-cost system that measured the effect of metallic impurities in the LAB electrolyte. This system consisted of a three electrode cell, able to detect low concentration effect of metallic impurities in the battery electrolyte, applying the Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) technique. In addition, a qualitative study was carried out comparing the catalytic impurity effect on HER in two different systems: a three electrode cell and a 2 V/ 1 Ah lead-acid mono cell. The following impurities were studied at different concentrations: nickel, bismuth, zinc, silver and selenium. The results show that the study by CV allows detecting the effect of impurities qualitatively at low concentrations of all impurities studied, except zinc. Furthermore, it was observed that an increment in the concentration of nickel and selenium in the LAB electrolyte leads to a noticeable increase in HER both in the three electrode and 2 V/ 1 Ah cell systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2352-152X		WOS:000701964500002

Herein, we present a general strategy of atomically confined alloying (ACA) to synthesize an electrocatalyst of single atom iridium-trapping cobalt nanosheets with dual-reactive Ir-Co sites. The atomic Ir@Co nanosheets (1.7 wt% Ir) exhibit excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with a small overpotential (273 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)) and high stability, higher than that of the Ir/C catalyst (290 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)). More importantly, density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experiments demonstrated that water oxidation proceeded on atomic Ir@Co nanosheets via a dinuclear tandem mechanism, in which Ir-Co dual sites cooperatively worked in favour of the sequential transfer from Co-OH* to Ir-O* via a Co-O-Ir intermediate, and stabilization of OOH* species by hydrogen bonding interaction. The cooperative mechanism based on a dinuclear electrocatalyst by ACA is hoped to open up more possibilities of single atom noble metal electrocatalysts for various applications.									40	4	0	0	2	0	41			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000464414200038

The oxygen evolution performance of the optimized Co-Fe-O-B catalyst in alkali water (1 M KOH) showed higher reaction rates owing to a Co3O4-core-Co2B-shell structure, which assists in the formation of active CoOOH species at lower potentials and offers a smaller charge-transfer resistance. The best-performing catalyst in alkali water was found to be highly active (294 mV to achieve 10 mA/cm(2)) in saline water (1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl), with 100% O-2 selectivity, establishing its potential for seawater electrolysis. The high activity and selectivity of the oxy-boride catalyst in alkaline saline electrolyte presents a fresh avenue for research in low-cost materials, especially boron-containing compounds, for selective seawater splitting.									26	2	0	0	2	0	27			2574-0962			WOS:000563784400042

By using a microwave-assisted reaction and particularly the bubble bursting effect caused by the mixed solvent (ethylene glycol and DI water), ultrathin Co8FeS8/CoS heterostructural nanoparticles homogeneously grown on orderly rearranged and highly conductive CNT skeleton. As an OER catalyst, the Co8FeS8/CoS@CNT delivers an ultralow overpotential of only 278 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), a very small Tafel slope of 49 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability, which is attributed to its highly conductive CNT-based porous nanoarchitecture, and particularly the uniform distribution of Co8FeS8/CoS heterostructural nanoparticles. This work provides a promising strategy for rational design and time-saving and environment-friendly synthesis of low-cost transition metal-based hybrid electrocatalysts as well as maximizing the catalytic potential for not only limited to metallic sulfide but probably also other kinds of catalytic materials.									36	2	0	0	3	0	36			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000510947000043

Herein, we report a bifunctional hybrid CoS/MoS2 nanoparticle electrocatalyst in 1 M KOH, fulfilling desirable industrial criteria for water electrolysis. The CoS/MoS2 catalyst exhibits excellent OER and HER activities with very low overpotentials as well as outstanding stability for more than 100 h, even at a high current density of 250 mA cm(-2). The bifunctional CoS/MoS2 catalyst-based water-electrolyzer exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) (1.714 V at 100 mA cm(-2)) with long-term stability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the hybrid CoS/MoS2 electrocatalyst shows one-way electron transfer that can activate both oxidative/reductive reactions. Therefore, it exhibits superior OER and HER activities, outperforming the state-of-the-art noble-metal-free catalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000804557700003

Nanostructures composed of Pt-Bi and Pd-Bi alloys in different elemental proportions and shapes are produced by solvo-thermal and hydrothermal chemical routes at moderate temperatures. The alloying of cost-effective bismuth with platinum is found to be much more efficient than that with palladium for the boosting of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Interestingly, Pt-rich Pt-Bi structures with irregular-shaped thin morphologies are more suitable for HER, whereas cubic-like Pt-Bi nanostructures prove to be better catalysts for the ORR. The higher mass activity of Pt-Bi alloys in ORR than that of pure Bi and Pd-Bi alloys as well as the low HER overpotentials, which are comparable with benchmark 10% Pt/C catalysts, are attributed to synergistic effects, due to the coexistence and satisfactory degree of alloying between both metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000828832600001

Cr(VI) is added to the electrolyte in order to minimize the amount of oxygen formed through the homogeneous decomposition of hypochlorite. Despite the importance of Cr(VI) for the chlorate process we posses only very limited knowledge regarding the active Cr(VI) species and mechanisms through which it aids chlorate formation and inhibits O-2 evolution. Using density functional theory (DFT) modeling we present for the first time a detailed reaction mechanism for the chromate catalyzed chlorate formation. Our calculations indicate, that the reaction is initialized by the formation of a Cr(VI)-O-ClOCl species which forms Cr(VI)-OClO intermediate. This step is found to be rate determining with a rate constant which is comparable to the disproportionation reaction without catalyst. Chlorate is then obtained either through an uncatalyzed oxidation of chlorite to chlorate or the nucleophilic attack of OCl- followed by a second Cl- elimination step. The comparison of the activity of the different Cr(VI) species reveals that only CrO42- is active whereas HCrO4- and Cr2O72- display sluggish kinetics.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000778018900001

The obtained Mo2N-MoS2 MCNFs manifests superior performance with improved durableness for electrocatalysis. Independently, at 10 mA cm(-2), the optimal Mo2N-MoS2(1:1) MCNFs achieves overpotentials (eta(10)) of 131 mV for HER and 270 mV for OER. The intimate interaction between the few-layered MoS2 nanosheets array and 1D multi-channel hollow carbon nanofibers Mo2N (Mo2N/Carbon MCNFs) advances better exposure of dynamic heterointerfaces, improves the conductivity of electron transfer, and enriches active sites with efficient mass transport. When employed to drive the water electrolysis, Mo2N-MoS2(1:1) MCNFs also demonstrates a modest overall potential of merely 1.63 V to hit 10 mA cm(-2).

Here, we report the preparation of a series of conductive M-CAT metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (M-3(HHTP)(2), HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) and their utilization as a "precatalyst" for the OER in an alkaline electrolyte.

The nanorod arrays and ordering were characterized by scanning electron microscope. Pt-IrO2/carbon paper directly used as catalyst layer and support layer with the united structure on the anode side is demonstrated to have excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution in proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis cell.

The Pt-IrO2 electrocatalysts with uniform nanorod arrays structure, good conductivity are supposed to play a key role for their enhanced catalytic activity toward oxygen evolution reaction.

Designing highly efficient OER catalysts is attractive to accelerate this process. Monoclinic oxides have gained enormous interest as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their low cost and abundant storage. The introduction of transition metals into metal oxides to tune the electronic structure of active sites is regarded as one of the promising methods for enhancing OER performance. Herein, we designed a Fe-2(MoO4)(3) catalyst by a spray pyrolysis strategy and enhanced the OER performance of Fe-2(MoO4)(3) with Co doping, which displayed a low overpotential of 273 mV to drive 10 mA cm(2). The octahedral Fe site engineering leads to higher reaction kinetics and more active site exposure. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the introduction of Co can reduce the energy barrier for the OER process and weaken the absorption of *-O. This work provides a new insight into the fabrication of monoclinic oxide electrocatalysts for OERs in alkaline media.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2052-1553			WOS:000747519700001

The resultant materials are composed of interconnected periodic macropore channels with texture mesopores, which can provide high electrical conductivity, efficient mass transport and abundant active sites during electrocatalytic water splitting. Benefiting from the unique multiscale pore structure, the 3DOM Ni3Fe phosphide as a bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits high activities for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The experimental results suggest that the phosphorization treatment of Ni3FeOx to Ni3Fe-P leads to a roughened surface and enhanced affinity with aqueous electrolyte, accounting for the greatly improved catalytic performance. An alkaline electrolyzer is constructed using 3DOM Ni3Fe-P as both the anode and cathode, which can realize overall water splitting at a significantly low overpotential of only 420 mV for delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The template-assisting method is versatile which is readily applied to fabricate a CoFe-P electrocatalyst. The effective construction of a 3DOM structure by the templating method has been discussed in terms of the compatibility between the PMMA template and metal sources.

Electrochemical water splitting is the only solution for uninterrupted, scalable, and sustainable production of hydrogen without carbon emission. However, a large-scale hydrogen production through electrochemical water splitting depends on the availability of earth-abundant electrocatalysts and a suitable electrolyte medium. In this article, we demonstrate that hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of electrocatalytic materials can be controlled by their surface functionalization and selection of a suitable electrolyte solution. Here, we report syntheses of few-layered MoS2 nanosheets, NiO nanoparticles (NPs), and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) using scalable production methods from earth-abundant materials. Magnetic measurements of as-produced electrocatalyst materials demonstrate that MoS2 nanoflakes are diamagnetic, whereas surface-functionalized MoS2 and its composite with carbon nanotubes have strong ferromagnetism. The HER performance of the few-layered pristine MoS2 nanoflakes, MoS2/NiO NPs, and MoS2/NiO NPs/MWCNT nanocomposite electrocatalysts are studied in acidic and alkaline media. For bare MoS2, the values of overpotential (eta(10)) in alkaline and acidic media are 0.45 and 0.54 V, respectively. Similarly, the values of current density at 0.5 V overpotential are 27 and 6.2 mA/cm(2) in alkaline and acidic media, respectively. The surface functionalization acts adversely in the both alkaline and acidic media. MoS2 nanosheets functionalized with NiO NPs also demonstrated excellent performance for oxygen evolution reaction with anodic current of similar to 60 mA/cm(2) and Tafel slope of 78 mVdec(-1) in alkaline medium.

Historically, various static assessment factors have been used to examine a wide range of catalytic materials. Surface, interfacial, and nanoscale phenomena have been seen in various catalytic disciplines, which are crucial to major applications. These phenomena sparked extensive discussions on how catalysts operate for reactions and adapt to working environments. With this recognition, the goal of this review is to go beyond the traditional static analysis of working catalysts and provide a perspective on the dynamic insights into structural and redox transformations at catalytic surfaces and electrified interfaces. The correlation between the transformation of working catalysts and their catalytic performance is examined, shedding light on understanding and controlling catalyst redox and structure evolution under operating conditions with properties tailored to thermochemical and electrocatalytic processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-5435			WOS:000819463200001

Herein, Ni-Fe nanocubes (NiFe NCs) have been synthesized as the templates through a self-assembly process. Then phosphorization, sulfurization or coupling process has been used to prepare different binary Ni-Fe nanocubes samples. The coupled phosphorization and sulfurization (P-S-NiFe NCs) can improve the intrinsic activity, which may be due to rough surface with rich active sites towards OER. Moreover, compared to S-NiFe, P-NiFe and S-P-NiFe NCs, P-S-NiFe NCs maintains intact cubic structure and exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 270 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(2). The order of phosphorization and sulfurization are the key for unique structure and excellent activity. Therefore, the controllable phosphorsulfurization treatment of binary metal-based nanostructure may be a promising strategy to prepare excellent electrocatalysts for water oxidation.

Herein, a general designing strategy to improve the HER activity of LDHs by P doping and deposition of metal nanodots (NDs) is proposed, which increases one order of magnitude higher than that of pristine LDHs. The obtained electrocatalyst, such as Cu NDs/P-FeCoLDH (CPFC-LDH), reaching a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) with only 63 mV overpotential for HER in alkaline electrolyte. The adsorption energy of H-ads and OH on catalyst is optimized by this strategy, which can weaken the interaction between the adsorbed H-ads and electronegative oxygen in LDHs by formation of P-O bonds. This work provides a strategy to develop LDHs materials with high catalytic activity for HER.									21	1	0	0	8	0	21			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702068100002

Agr-Dp and Ag-DP from r-DP and DP, respectively, are easily tuned for their activities in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) favoring or selective CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Agr-Dp shows Pt-like HER activity in H(2)SO(4 )aqueous solution, and Ag-Dp is capable of electrochemically reducing CO2 to CO with approximately 97.8% catalytic selectivity at a low overpotential of similar to 0.25 V in NaHCO3 aqueous solution. The electrochemical signals for the first observed CO2 center dot- intermediate adsorption (CO2ads center dot-) and HCO3- adsorption (HCO3ads-) in the selected NaClO4 aqueous solution were used to understand the possible role of HCO3- in CO2RR.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			2168-0485			WOS:000461978200082

Although the nitrogen doping is often integrated in such kind of catalysts, the main contribution is exclusively attributed to the metal sites or the core-shell configuration. The role of nitrogen doping is often believed to be less important, which remains largely unexplored. Here, in an effort to probe the catalytic role of heterogeneous doping in such core-shell structure, the effect of nitrogen doping on the activation of cobalt and iron carbide-based materials for the electrocatalytic reduction of oxygen and the hydrogen evolution reaction is originally revealed. The nitrogen doping in the core-shell structured biphasic interfaces is found to be of critical importance for triggering the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. Therefore, this study shows the neglected but critical role of nitrogen doping and biphasic interactions in a core-shell configuration, paving a new pathway towards the performance enhancement.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000446980600008

Here, we report the synthesis of an ultrathin Co3O4 nanofilm with a thickness of nearly 1.8 nm via a surfactant-and template-free facile hydrothermal route. The proposed synthesis strategy can be extended to the preparation of 2D NixCo3-O-x(4) and FexCo3-O-x(4) nanostructures. The synthesized Co3O4 nanofilm exhibited bifunctional activity that was superior to that of the counterpart Co3O4 nanoparticles, including a lower overpotential and higher reduction and evolution current densities, and demonstrated faster catalytic kinetics over the 2D nanofilm surface. In comparison with precious metal-based catalysts, to achieve an OER current density of 40 mA cm(-2) the overpotential of the nanofilm (461 mV) was lower than that of RuO2 (526 mV), whereas the ORR on the nanofilm proceeded via a dominant 4e(-) transfer mechanism, which is similar to that of commercial carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C). The Co3O4 nanofilm enabled the assembly of rechargeable Zn-air batteries with a lower overpotential (0.72 V), higher round-trip efficiency (62.7%), and a longer cycle lifetime (175 cycles). The remarkable bifunctional activity contributes to an increase in the number of electrochemically active sites, a large interfacial contact area with the electrolyte, and the enrichment of Co3+ ions on the surface, which facilitates the adsorption and activation of oxygen-containing species. This study should shed light on the future development of new electroactive materials with optimized 2D nanostructures to enhance the overall bifunctional ORR/OER performance of rechargeable metal-air batteries.									81	7	0	0	0	0	83			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000404614700012	28608902

However, the electricity kinetics in alkaline is relatively sluggish than in acid owing to the concentration of protons in alkaline is low. Thus, accurate structural designs to obtain more protons in the water dissociation on the surface of catalyst are necessary. In this work, a defect-rich MoP is encapsulated with carbon shell, which precisely regulated to distinguish the affection on hydrogen evolution reaction. The synergistic effect between carbon shell and defective sites is identified by the free energy and charge distribution density for water/hydrogen adsorption in hydrogen evolution via a density functional theory calculation. The results show that the lattice defects and the carbon shells play a unique role in enhancing catalytic performance, which the lattice defects decide the active sites and the thinner carbon shell would enhance its activity. The optimal overpotential in alkaline media of this designed MoP/C is 100 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), its Tafel slope is 67.4 mV dec(-1), and also exhibits a long-term stability for 12 h.

However, the process of water splitting is greatly hindered by the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is kinetically sluggish and requires large over-potentials. Herein, we report an active and stable OER catalyst by electrodeposition of ultrathin Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets on three-dimensional interwoven nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs). The Ni(OH)(2) nanosheets grown on the N-CNTs afforded a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of only 254 mV, smaller than the commercial IrO2 catalyst. Moreover, the as-prepared catalyst shows long-term durability almost without degradation over 100 h. The excellent OER activity can be ascribed to the unique layered structure of Ni(OH)(2), the ultrathin and interconnected features of the nanosheets, and the three-dimensional (3D) porous conducting network of the N-CNTs. The rational design strategy can be extended to the preparation of other non-precious metal catalysts with enhanced OER performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is still unclear how the abundant 3d-elements can be used to drive the four-electron oxidation of water as efficiently as in Nature. In this Feature Article, we will propose a design strategy concerning the optimization of the charge accumulation process based on our ongoing spectroelectrochemical study on Mn, Fe, and Ir oxygen evolution catalysts. Spectroscopic identification of the reaction intermediates showed that the activity of MnO2 and Fe2O3 was dictated by the generation of Mn3+ and Fe4+, whereas in the case of IrOx, the activity did not correlate with the valence change of Ir. The efficiency of charge accumulation through valence change is closely linked with the spin configuration of the metal center, because charge disproportionation, which was found to inhibit charge accumulation in the high-spin 3d metals, requires an electron in the e(g) orbital. In addition to directly increasing the overpotential through the generation of an unstable intermediate, charge disproportionation inhibits charge accumulation by dissipating the total oxidative energy of the system. A favorable charge accumulation process may also be beneficial for electrode kinetics due to the enhanced coupling between reaction rates and electrochemical driving force. The model proposed in this study may help explain why low-spin 4d/5d rare metals are often more active than the abundant high-spin 3d materials for multi-electron transfer reactions in general, and provides new insight into how active 3d-metal catalysts can be synthesized by optimizing the energetics of both bond formation and charge accumulation.									32	2	0	0	3	0	33			1359-7345	1364-548X		WOS:000404605000002	28466887

However, rational design of such bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is still challenging. Here, due to the well-matched lattice parameters, we easily achieved the epitaxy of two-dimensional ternary nickel thiophosphate (NiPS3) nanosheets with in-grown dinickel phosphide (Ni2P) through an in situ growth strategy. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the NiPS3/Ni2P heterojunction significantly decreases the kinetic barrier for hydrogen adsorption and accelerates electron transfer due to the built-in electric field at the epitaxial interfaces. The significantly improved electrocatalytic performance is shown to be closely related to the epitaxial interfacial area rather than the amount of secondary phase. Notably, the resultant NiPS3/Ni2P heterostructures enable an overall water splitting electrolyzer to achieve 50 mA cm(-2) at a lower bias of 1.65 V compared to that for the pristine NiPS3 alone (2.02 V) and even the benchmark Pt/C//IrO2 electrocatalysts (1.69 V).									119	8	0	0	3	0	119			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000477786400062	31265235

Additionally, the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a huge obstacle for efficient hydrogen production. Herein, an intersected nanosheets decorating micro-walls structure nickel-cobalt phosphide grown on Ni foam electrode (NiCoP/NF) is prepared, and displays good hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), excellent hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and enhanced NiCoP/NF//Zn battery capacity performance. Based on the trifunctional NiCoP/NF electrode, a continuous solar-driven energy-saving hydrogen generation is constructed. The solar cells drive the efficient hydrogen production and hydrazine degradation plus simultaneously charge the NiCoP/NF//Zn battery during the day; then the charged NiCoP/NF//Zn battery provide high output voltage to drive hydrogen generation and hydrazine degradation at night.

It has been established that this process involves multistep electron-transfer reactions between surface defects and adsorbed O-2 and H2O, releasing sulfoxy species (e.g., S2O32-, SO42-) and ferrous iron (Fe2-) to the solution and also producing intermediate by-products, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and other reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, our understanding of the kinetics of these transient species is still limited. We investigated the kinetics of H2O2 formation in aqueous suspensions of FeS2 microparticles by monitoring, in real time, the H2O2 and dissolved O-2 concentration under oxic and anoxic conditions using amperometric microsensors. Additional spectroscopic and structural analyses were done to track the dependencies between the process of FeS2 dissolution and the degradation of H2O2 through the Fenton reaction. Based on our experimental results, we built a kinetic model which explains the observed trend of H2O2, showing that FeS2 dissolution can act as a natural Fenton reagent, influencing the oxidation of third-party species during the long term evolution of geochemical systems, even in oxygen-limited environments.									33	0	0	0	13	0	33			2045-2322			WOS:000395544600001	28262831

We herein report a facile means of producing well dispersed RuO2/MnOOH on Ketjen black (RuO2/MnOOH/C) as a bifunctional catalyst for lithium-air (Li-air) batteries. RuO2/MnOOH/C was simply synthesized using a hydrothermal/precipitation based method, and was used as a cathode for a Li-air battery using a Swagelok-type cell. The importance of dispersing active catalysts on a carbon support was clearly demonstrated by textural, charge-discharge voltammetric, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analyses, comparing results with a catalyst produced by physically mixing RuO2/MnOOH with carbon (RuO2/MnOOH + C). RuO2/MnOOH/C showed low overpotential and stable cycleability up to 170th cycles with 1000 mAh g(-1) of charge-discharge capacity, which was attributed to its enhanced active surface area and low charge-transfer resistance. The results obtained suggest that this strategy can be widely applied to bifunctional electrocatalysis, such as secondary batteries and regenerative fuel cell (RFC). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, rational design and manufacture of OER catalysts for further enhancing the electrochemical ac-tivity and durability are still challenging, which significantly limits their practical utilization. Herein, novel three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide/Co9S8 composites (Co9S8/rGO) are constructed by a facile strategy of ultrasonic spray drying assisted with sequential heat treatment process. Such crumpled structure possesses extraordinary synergistic effects between the two components of Co9S8 and rGO. The optimal sample exhibits ultra-low overpotential of 0.308 V, Tafel slope of 130.0 mV dec(-1) at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), as well as excellent cycling stability in 1 M KOH. The superior catalytic activity of the crumpled Co9S8/rGO composite is attributed to its unique structure including large surface area and abundant sites for potential catalysis. This work provides a potential large-scale strategy to prepare cobalt sulfides based OER electrocatalysts and realize the development of the energy research for the generation of hydrogen from water.

The self-growth property without additives, the porous structure of Co3O4 nanorods observed from transmission electron microscopy, and the pore size distribution account for their exceptional electrochemical performances. As the anode for lithium-ion storage, the Co3O4 nanorods electrode exhibits prominent battery behaviors with high specific capacity, superior rate capability and excellent cycle life. To be specific, a high discharge capacity of 611 mAh g(-1) will be retained after 70 cycles at a current density of 300 mA g(-1). Besides, a discharge capacity up to 848 mAh g(-1) even at 100 mA g(-1) can be kept. Water oxidation electrocatalysts based on Co3O4 nanorods electrodes also exhibit a low overpotential of 383 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under long stability of 100,000 s. The present study confirmed a mesoporous Co3O4 nanorods electrode as a superb candidate for a high-performance anode in lithium storage and OER activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0361-5235	1543-186X		WOS:000488962300063

It was shown that the intrinsic activity of different catalysts depends on the incorporated amount of nickel and surprisingly correlates with the CoIII/CoIV peak potential. The electrochemical activity of the OER is amazingly improved upon potential cycling. It was observed that potential cycling induces an increase of active sites up to 45% on the most effective electrocatalyst. This unexpected increase in activity is very pronounced and becomes stable after 30 voltammetric cycles. Such a phenomenon is explained by the formation of a layered mixed nickel/cobalt oxyhydroxide active site whose oxidation potential is related to the nickel amount in the catalyst. The formation of this layer is promoted by the surface hydroxylation degree of non-cycled catalysts. In these catalysts, nickel modulates the electronic properties of the active site, which modifies the adsorption energies of key oxygenated intermediates. The synthesis route proposed herein allows an efficient way for obtaining high specific surface areas as well as highly hydroxylated surfaces, the latter being the key factor in the enhancement of the electrocatalytic activity of nickel cobaltites.									43	1	0	0	1	0	43			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000398889600043

Ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) has emerged as a promising candidate for such purposes, particularly in alkaline conditions. However, the scarceness of active sites is responsible for considerably lower catalytic performance of OMC. Herein, we report a new facile route to synthesize alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on ordered mesoporous carbons forming a new hybrid ORR catalyst. This catalyst displayed excellent catalytic properties, long-term stability and impressive methanol tolerance.									18	3	0	0	0	0	19			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000405305400025

An absorption peak was observed around 528.7 eV at 1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl in a potassium borate aqueous solution, which relates with the formation of nanoscale order domains of edge-sharing NiO6 octahedra in the Ni-B-i electrocatalyst. XAFS spectra were measured with variation of the electrode potential from 0.3 up to 1.0 V. The measured absorption peaks suggest that the quantity of NiO6 octahedra increased in correlation with the OER current; however, when the potential was changed downward, the XAFS absorption peak assigned to NiO6 octahedra remained constant, even at the electrode potential for no OER current. This difference implies that the water oxidation catalysis proceeds at the domain edge of NiO6 octahedra. The XAFS technique provides the first successful direct probing of the active species in the Ni-B-i electrocatalyst during electrochemical reaction.									64	2	0	0	5	0	65			1932-7447			WOS:000360026200049

The precursors (IrCI4 and NH4F) are mixed with NaNO3 and heated to elevated temperatures to form high surface area nanomaterials as electrocatalysts for PEM based water electrolysis. The catalysts were then coated on a porous Ti substrate and have been studied for the oxygen evolution reaction in PEM based water electrolysis. The IrO2:F with an optimum composition of IrO2:10 wt.% F shows remarkably superior electrochemical activity and chemical stability compared to pure IrO2. The results have also been supported via kinetic studies by conducting rotating disk electrode (ROE) experiments. The RDE studies confirm that the electro-catalysts follow the two electron transfer reaction for electrolysis with calculated activation energy of similar to 25 kJ mol(-1). Single full cell tests conducted also validate the superior electrochemical activity of the 10 wt.% F doped IrO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ITO electrodes undergo substantial changes under high positive potentials (greater than 1.5 V vs. a saturated calomel electrode) in aqueous electrolytes. Longer potentiostatic stress leads to a decrease in the oxygen evolution reaction. The rate of this decrease increases with increasing electrode potential. Fluctuations of the current density are possible. It was found by a combination of radiochemical and electrochemical methods that the oxygen evolution is accompanied by electrode corrosion. After this process the electrode probably consists of an unchanged bulk and an SnO2 coating; its quasi-metallic character has disappeared.									41	1	1	0	4	0	42			0022-0728			WOS:A1994MX37700024

Room temperature anodic evolution of oxygen at a nickel working electrode in aqueous potassium hydroxide and the high temperature (348 degrees C) anodic evolution of chlorine at a glassy carbon working electrode in molten (LiCl)(57.5)-(KCl)(13.3)-(CsCl)(29.2) where investigatd. Combining of the two techniques enables to separate the total measured overpotential into its ohmic, charge transfer, and mass transfer components. Potential decay curves indicated that natural convection (due to both bubble evolution and density driven flow) was a major driving force in reestablishing equilibrium conditions at the working electrode surface. During oxygen evolution, charge transfer resistance dominated the total overpotential at low current densities, but as the current density approached similar to 100mA/cm(2), mass transfer overpotentials and ohmic overpotential became non-negligible. The mass transfer overpotential during chlorine evolution was found to be half that found during oxygen evolution. (c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

In this study, the aim of the development was to evaluate if the observed effect of hydrogen cladding content on the increase of oxygen solubility in the high-temperature beta(Zr) was only a thermodynamic effect. Previous experimental studies have shown that hydrogen induces an evolution of equilibrium oxygen concentration at the alpha(Zr)/beta(Zr) interface. The present work showed that EKINOX-Zr linked with the thermodynamic database Zircobase reproduced the evolution induced by hydrogen during the high-temperature steam oxidation.

Herein, we show a flower-like cobalt oxide/cobalt sulphide nanosheet electrocatalyst via a simple and cheap one-step hydrothermal synthesis for electrochemical water oxidation. Tuning the sulphur concentration influences the crystal formation and structural direction to achieve flower-like morphologies that greatly improves the surface area to benefit the OER. The best OER electrocatalysts were achieved on the CoS (1:0.5) electrode, which can deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a small overpotential of 383 mV, a low Tafel slope (38 mV dec(-1)) and remains constant for over 24 h. Mechanism study shows that during OER, the cobalt sulphide acts as a pre-catalyst and produces more active cobalt oxide phases with higher Co valence state when undergoing oxidation. This innovative design demonstrates the catalytic activity and overall efficiency which can be applied as an efficient non-noble metal electrocatalyst for OER. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The presence of glucose in the synthesis is essential to the formation of the hollow structure and influences the size and morphology of the microspheres. Benefiting from the advantages of a hollow architecture, a conductive carbon coating and Co9S8 nanosheet units, the composite exhibits outstanding electrochemical properties. When the composite electrode is evaluated as the cathode material for supercapacitors, it exhibits a high specific capacitance of 514 Fg(-1) at 1.0 Ag-1 and a capacitance retention of circa 88% over 1000 cycles at 8 Ag-1. On the other hand, the nanosheet-constructed hollow structure can efficiently promote the electrocatalytic activity of Co9S8 toward the oxygen evolution reaction. Due to the fact that Co9S8 nanosheets impart largely exposed active sites, the composite exhibits a low Tafel slope of 66 mVdec(-1) and no obvious degradation after 12 h water oxidation.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2196-0216			WOS:000482102400017

Co-based species have been considered as a potential candidate to replace the precious RuO2 to electrocatalyze oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-67 (ZIF-67), a Co-containing MOF, may be an excellent precursor for single-atom OER electrocatalysts due to its rich and uniform distribution of cobalt species. In principle, Co ions are fully coordinated (except for those on the surfaces) in ZIF-67 without accessible sites for electrocatalysis. One way to utilize this single-atom material as electrocatalysts is to remove some of the ligands attached to Co atoms to create coordinately unsaturated metal sites (CUMSs) as the catalytic centers for OER. Herein, we, for the first time, have created CUMSs in ZIF-67 through dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma etching. The CUMSs act as excellent catalytic centers for OER with a promising electrocatalytic activity, even comparable to the precious RuO2. Interestingly, the OER activity of the CUMSs is reversible by supplementing the missing ligands. Our density-functional theory calculations also demonstrated the contribution of the unsaturated metal sites to the high catalytic activity for OER.									271	18	0	0	14	0	274			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000415302600045

In general species such as Co3O4 and CoOOH have been investigated that often require an elevated temperature step during their synthesis to create crystalline materials. In this work we investigate the rapid and direct electrochemical formation of amorphous nanostructured Co(OH)(2) on gold electrodes under room temperature conditions which is a highly active precursor for the OER. During the OER some conversion to crystalline Co3O4 occurs at the surface, but the bulk of the material remains amorphous. It is found that the underlying gold electrode is crucial to the materials enhanced performance and provides higher current density than can be achieved using carbon, palladium or copper support electrodes. This catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 360 mV with a high turnover frequency of 2.1 s(-1) in 1 M NaOH. A Tafel slope of 56 mV dec(-1) at low overpotentials and a slope of 122 mV dec(-1) at high overpotentials is consistent with the dual barrier model for the electrocatalytic evolution of oxygen. Significantly, the catalyst maintains excellent activity for up to 24 h of continuous operation and this approach offers a facile way to create a highly effective and stable material.									103	2	0	0	4	0	103			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000367625000033

The cyclic voltammetry of the oxide electrode in 1 M KOH indicated the formation of the diffusion-controlled quasi-reversible Ni(II)-Ni(III) redox couple, prior to the onset of O-2 evolution. The oxygen evolution reaction followed approximately first order kinetics in OH- concentration. The Tafel slope was 65 mV decade(-1).

Herein, a new series of group-11 chalcogenides MX (M = Au, Ag; X = S, Se, Te) single layers are predicted by DFT calculations. The formation energy, phonon dispersion spectra and AIMD are calculated to certificate that MX monolayers are highly stable. MX monolayers are indirect bandgap semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.89-2.21 eV and their carrier mobilities [250.11-989.71 cm(2)/(V.s)]are also confirmed to be superior or comparable to that of MoS2 [similar to 200 cm(2)/(V.s)]. More particularly, their absorption of sunlight can reach the infrared light region, which far exceeds other commonly reported OER catalysts. Finally, it is confirmed that AuS, AuSe and AgS are potential photocatalytic OER agents, in which AuSe shows the best performance because it can spontaneously undergo OER under pH = 7 and light conditions. Moreover, we also hope that MX (M = Au, Ag; X = S, Se, Te) monolayers can be widely used in optoelectronic devices due to their excellent light capture performances.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000860993600002

Fe40Co40Se20/CFP thin films were deposited by vacuum magnetron sputtering at substrate temperatures of 308, 393, and 573 K. In 1MKOH, the amorphous film deposited at 393 K exhibited better comprehensive electrocatalytic activity and stability than that of the Fe40Co40Se20/CFP thin films deposited under other conditions, achieving a low overpotential of 307 mV at a current density of 10mAcm(-2) and low Tafel slope of 35mVdec(-1). These results reveal that an appropriate substrate temperature during film formation improves the catalytic performance of thin film catalysts to some extent. Acombination of lowcharge resistance and large electrochemically active surface area contributes to the electrocatalytic performance of the Fe40Co40Se20/CFP thin films.

Among the huge 2D materials family, ultrathin 2D metallic nanocrystals gain vast attention due to the unique importance of transition metals to heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we review recent representative advances in ultrathin 2D metallic nanocrystals and their catalytic applications toward a variety of reactions, including the hydrogen generation, oxygen reduction/evolution, CO2 activation, and small molecules' oxidation/hydrogenation. Special focuses are placed in current understanding of bottom-up fabrication of ultrathin 2D metallic nanocrystals, the establishment of their structure-performance relationship as well as the implication of their real applications in devices. We also shed light on further structural modification of the ultrathin 2D metallic nanocrystals to achieve the optimized catalytic performance.

Cyclic and linear scan voltammetries were then undertaken to evaluate the effect of mixing iridium and ruthenium oxides on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The activity of these anode catalysts was evidenced through the determination of their capacitances, surface charges and Tafel slopes. It was found that the Ru0.9Ir0.1O2 catalyst presented catalytic properties close to those of RuO2, in particular for low overpotentials. The proposed synthesis method was also shown to be suitable for recovering large catalyst amount for O-2 production in a large surface proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Polarization measurements were therefore performed in a single PEMWE cell and the durability of the catalytic materials was evaluated by supplying a solar power profile. The efficiency loss at 1 A cm(-2) and 80 degrees C was only 90 mu Vh(-1) for 1000 h under galvanodynamic operating conditions for Ru0.9Ir0.1O2 as anode, while the cell voltage varied between 1.75 and 1.85 V.

Herein, based on metal organic framework (MOP), we develop an effective strategy to synthesize Ni nanoparticles embedded in N doped carbon nanotubes (Ni NPs@N-CNTs) catalyst. In consequence, the Ni NPs@N-CNTs integrates the advantageous features of NPs and N-CNTs towards OER, such as more catalytic sites, large surface area, pore-rich structure and good electrical conductivity. Benefiting from the favorable features, the Ni NPs N-CNTs exhibits a better OER performance than commercial RuO2 in alkaline medium, which includes a lower onset potential (1.49 V), a smaller Tafel slope (106 mV dec(-1)). The present work opens a new window for the construction of the coupling materials between NPs and carbon-based materials to increase the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal catalysts.

Substituting the precious metal catalysts with more accessible transition metal oxide such as Fe2O3 is a key solution for applications in water electrolysis. Here, we show an efficient modified electrode for oxygen evolution, which be developed by co-electrodeposition of graphene oxide and Fe2O3 nanoparticles directly onto macroporous nickel foam substrate. Then, using an electrochemical procedure, in-situ electro-polymerization of pyrrole and graphene oxide reduction are performed on the electrode surface. The sugar-cubic Fe2O3 nanoparticles are also prepared by the hydrothermal method. The morphology and structure of the Fe2O3 nanoparticles and Fe2O3/ graphene nanocomposites are characterized by Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) methods. Moreover, the OER activities of the synthesized catalysts are investigated by using Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Chronopotentiometry (CP) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The electrocatalytic activity of the sugar-cubic Fe2O3/nitrogen-doped graphene nanocomposite prepared by hydro thermal method in alkaline media shows outstanding advantages, so that its over potential was 313 mV and its Tafel slope was 81 mV/dec.

However, OR reactions are often confused by irreversible oxygen oxidation. Here, based on high-efficiency mapping of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of both the transition metal and oxygen, we distinguish the lattice OR in Na-0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O-2 and compare it with Na-2/3[Mg1/3Mn2/3]O-2. Both systems display strong lattice OR activities but with distinct electrochemical stability. The comparison shows that the substantial capacity drop in Na-0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O-2 stems from non-lattice oxygen oxidations, and its voltage decay from an increasing Mn redox contribution upon cycling, contrasting those in Na-2/3[Mg1/3Mn2/3]O-2. We conclude that lattice OR is not the ringleader of the stability issue. Instead, irreversible oxygen oxidation and the changing cationic reactions lead to the capacity and voltage fade. We argue that lattice OR and other oxygen activities should/could be studied and treated separately to achieve viable OR-based electrodes.									58	3	0	0	0	0	58			2375-2548			WOS:000512902300004	32083173

Yet, the anode in PEMWEs, where the pivotal oxygen evolution reaction takes place, needs further improvement in terms of performance and cost. Both catalyst materials and electrode structure have to be optimized in order to inhibit degradation and reduce noble metal loadings. This review focuses on a holistic approach, covering all catalyst material, electrode structure, and transport layers within the framework of an overall electrode design, which not only optimizes the catalyst but also, all components of the electrode in conjunction. This review defines the goals for performance metrics of future PEMWEs in terms of power density and durability of the anode. Moreover, it summarizes manufacturing techniques and approaches that have a chance to be upscaled to meet the megawatt deployment of PEMWEs. The different aspects described jointly in this review such as novel catalyst system with higher intrinsic and structural performance or graded porous transport layers shall help to advance a next generation of electrodes.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000706881400001

Herein, uniform Co9S8@MoS2 core-shell heterostructures have been successfully prepared via a solvothermal approach, followed by an annealing treatment. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements reveal that the core-shell structure of Co9S8@MoS2 can introduce heterogeneous nanointerface between Co9S8 and MoS2, which can deeply influence its charge state to boost the electrocatalytic performances. Besides, due to the core-shell structure that can promote the synergistic effect of Co9S8 and MoS2 and provide abundant catalytically active sites, Co9S8@MoS2 exhibits a superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance with a small overpotential of 143 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope value of 117 mV dec(-1) under alkaline solution. Meanwhile, the activity of Co9S8@MoS2 toward oxygen evolution reaction is also impressive with a low operating potential (similar to 1.57 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) at 10 mA cm(-2). By using Co9S8@MoS2 catalyst for full water splitting, an alkaline electrolyzer affords a cell voltage as low as 1.67 V at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Also, Co9S8@MoS2 reveals robust oxygen reduction reaction performance, making it an excellent catalyst for Zn-air batteries with a long lifetime (20 h). This work provides a new means for the development of multifunctional electrocatalysts of non-noble metals for the highly demanded electrochemical energy technologies.									174	14	0	0	8	0	179			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000423140400025	29265801

In this work, a shell-core structured catalyst of polyaniline coated hybrid Ni3Mo2P-MoO3 nanoarrays is designed for oxygen evolution. The polyaniline shell not only assures merit of high conductivity for accelerated charge transfer, but also benefits the catalysis stability. The coupling effect between nitrogen species of polyaniline shell and metals of core materials imparts improved intrinsic catalysis activity and more active sites. Hence, the present sample manifests excellent catalytic efficiency for alkali water oxidation, only needing low overpotentials of 290 and 412 mV at high current densities of 100 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively. The development of shell-core catalyst using polyaniline as shell material paves a way for activating other transition metal catalytic materials and supplies a basis for industrial water splitting applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000767854900001

The polarization studies show that the ZnWO4-NPs@rGO nanocomposites exhibit low energy loss and good electrode stability during electrochemical reactions for HER. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of ZnWO4-NPs@rGO nanocomposites is found to be approximately 149 mV/dec, which closely agrees with the reported Tafel values of the noble metal electrocatalyst. In contrast, the performance of the ZnWO4-NPs@rGO nanocomposite is found to be approximately 1.5 times higher than that of ZnWO4-NPs in hydrogen production efficiency. Our results emphasize the significance of the nanocomposites with enhanced electro-catalytic activities by lowering the energy loss during electro-catalysis in an alkaline medium.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000801789200001

However, the current catalysts still suffer from insufficient hydrogen adsorption energy.

Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculation further confirms that the doped heterostructure promotes Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption. And the significant increase in the density of total states (DOS) also enhances the catalytic activity of HER.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000823385500012

In this study we demonstrate a set of linear correlations between the binding of adsorbates to the shell and the alloy-core composition, which are general across a range of nanoparticle compositions, size, and adsorbate molecules. This systematic tunability allows for a simple approach to the design of such catalysts. Calculations of candidate structures for the hydrogen evolution reaction predict a high activity for the PtRu@Pd structure, in good agreement with what has been reported previously.

Effectively doping graphene is thus crucial for inducing ideal electron transfer for the desired reaction. Functionalization of graphene with non-covalent adsorbents can accurately modulate its electronic state by providing an ideal doping configuration without damaging the basal plane. Herein, graphitic carbon-nitride (g-C3N4) is embedded on non-oxidized graphene aerogel (NOGA) with non-covalent adsorbents (polyvinylpyrrolidone for n-type and pyrenebutyric acid for p-type) to promote either the oxygen reduction or evolution reaction (ORR or OER). As a result, the embedded g-C3N4 showed catalytic performance comparable to those of noble metals, such as a low overpotential of 0.79 V vs. RHE on ORR activity, or 1.42 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm(-2) on the OER, and on n-type or p-type NOGA, respectively. This work may provide insights into the design of an effective conductive support for utilizing catalysts for multifunctional purposes.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000823747300001

Herein, Ni nanoparticles (similar to 10 nm) decorated NiFe LDH ultrathin (thickness: similar to 2 nm) nanosheets (Ni NP/NiFe LDH) were successfully synthesized which exhibited advanced electrocatalytic activity and long-term stability on both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The onset potentials for OER and UOR are 1.50 V and 1.34 V, respectively, both are lower than NiFe LDH under the same conditions. Moreover, the peak current density of UOR was 300 mA/cm(2), which is much larger than reported precious-metal free UOR catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Ni NP/NiFe LDH composite for OER and UOR is proposed to result from the abundant exposed active sites, small charge transfer resistance, and the synergistic effects between NiFe LDH and anchored Ni nanoparticles. This work provides inspiring ideas and helpful guidelines in design of low-cost but highly efficient electrochemical catalysts. (C) The Author(s) 2017. Published by ECS.

However, only a few kinds of materials display an intrinsically good performance towards water splitting. It is significant but challengeable to effectively improve the catalytic activity of inert or less active catalysts for water splitting. Herein, we present a structural/electronic modulation strategy to con-vert inert AlOOH nanorods into catalytic nanosheets for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via ball milling, plasma etching and Co doping. Compared to inert AlOOH, the modulated AlOOH delivers much better OER performance with a low overpotential of 400 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and a very low Tafel slope of 52 mV dec-1, even lower than commercial OER catalyst RuO2. Significant performance enhancement is attributed to the electronic and structural modulation. The electronic structure is effectively improved by Co doping, ball milling-induced shear strain, plasma etching-caused rich vacancies; abrupt morphol-ogy/microstructure change from nanorod to nanoparticle to nanosheet, as well as rich defects caused by ball milling and plasma etching, can significantly increase active sites; the free energy change of the potential determining step of modulated AlOOH decreases from 2.93 eV to 1.70 eV, suggesting a smaller overpotential is needed to drive the OER processes. This strategy can be extended to improve the electrocatalytic performance for other materials with inert or less catalytic activity.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

A novel three-dimensional (3D) ternary transition metal hydroxide, FeCoNi-layered double hydroxide (FeCoNi-LDH) nanocage has been successfully synthesized by the cation exchange reaction using the metal-organic framework as a template. The obtained ternary FeCoNi-LDH nanocage displays excellent electrocatalytic activity, such as the low overpotential of 299 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with a Tafel slope of 50 mV dec(-1). Moreover, the FeCoNi-LDH nanocage could also be used as a high-performance electrode for supercapacitor, which presents a high specific capacity of 980 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) in 3.0 M KOH. More importantly, the electrode possesses a superb rate capability with 93% capacity retention even at a current density of 20 A g(-1). These results manifest that FeCoNi-LDH has a wide prospect in the application in the energy conversion and storage fields.									30	1	0	0	0	0	30			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000574904900112

The kinetics analysis suggested that the Mn2+ could significantly enhance OER, which was controlled by the electron transfer process between the active site S and H2O (step (2)). This positive effect of Mn2+ on OER was limited with the increase of Mn2+ because of the approaching saturation of active sites. Results obtained from the Arrhenius equation disclosed the larger bond strength of MnO2-OH in decreasing the activation energy of OER (from 55.08 to 47.04 kJ/mol), meanwhile, it also further supported the fact that the OER was electrochemical controlled and it would not be changed in essence with the addition of Mn2+, which is subject to the activation energy barrier of electron transfer induced by the active site S (step (2)). EIS data revealed adsorption resistance of the intermediate (S-OHads), R-a played a major role among the whole reaction resistance, whereas, the impact contribution of charge transfer resistance, R-t became larger as the Mn2+ increases, which revealed that the inhibition of electron transfer process due to the changes of the anode surface microstructure. Electron microscope technology suggested the key role Mn2+ played in the modification of the active interface structure, and its influence process on OER was revealed by the microstructure analysis of anode surface. Considering the potential of Mn2+ concentration optimization in reducing heavy metal pollutants and energy consumption, enhancing the understanding of impact mechanism of Mn2+ on OER provides a feasible proposal in zinc electrolysis industry.									11	2	0	0	1	0	12			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000428488400007

In this work, various heteroatoms (S/N/B/P) with different electronegativities and oxophilicities are introduced to alter the catalytic activity of reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is found that, surprisingly, S-doped RGO outperforms the other RGOs doped with more electropositive or electronegative and more oxophilic heteroatoms, and this effect becomes more prominent after Fe treatment of the respective catalysts. Herein, we evaluate the OER activity of a series of Fe-treated mono-heteroatom (S/N/B/P)-doped RGO (Fe-X-G) catalysts, among which interestingly S-doped RGO catalyst treated with Fe (Fe-S-G) is found to show better OER activity than the well-known active Fe-N-C catalyst, demonstrating the best activity among all of the prepared catalysts, close to that of the state of the art IrO2/C catalyst, along with pronounced long-term stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the OER activity highly depends on the electroneutrality and oxophilicity of doped heteroatoms and doping-induced charge distribution over RGO, demonstrating that S with mediocre electronegativity and the least oxophilicity exhibits optimal free energy for the adsorption of the OER intermediate and desorption of the final OER product. Furthermore, it is found that Fe treatment greatly helps in enhancing the number of active sites through the regeneration of reduced catalytically active S sites and improving the conductivity and surface area of the S-doped RGO, which are found to be key factors to furnish the Fe-S-G catalyst with the capability to catalyze the OER with high efficiency, even though Fe is found to be absent in the final catalyst.									75	2	0	0	3	0	75			2155-5435			WOS:000398986700016

However, the improvement of SnOx catalytic performance is hindered by its complex surface structures and limited knowledge about the nature of the active sites. This Letter describes the critical role of oxygen vacancies (O-v) in partially reduced SnO2(110) for CO2RR selectivity by combined theoretical and experimental studies. The SnOx with moderate content of O-v is the most active surface and can suppress the undesirable hydrogen evolution reaction simultaneously. This is also confirmed by the electrochemical experiments that also demonstrate that the selectivity of HCOOH changes with varied content of O-v. Further electronic structure analysis reveals that the bond strength and charge transfer between HCOO* and the active site can be regulated by varying the content of O-v, so that the adsorption strength of HCOO* can be tuned.									24	2	0	0	1	0	24			2380-8195			WOS:000514258200025

We developed an aerosol-based synthesis technique as a comparatively fast and facile method to prepare multi-metal catalysts. 22 different quinary metal compositions were synthesized and investigated with respect to their activity for the oxygen evolution (OER) and the glycerol oxidation (GOR) reactions. The impact of the element composition and the homogeneous distribution of the elements in the particles on catalytic performance were evaluated. The highest activity for OER was found for Co20Cu20Ni20Fe20Zn20. For GOR, Ag-containing catalysts were the most active, however, in most cases Ag was locally enriched and not homogeneously mixed with the other metals in the particles. Ag-based catalysts outperformed similar compositions containing one or more noble metals. The GOR selectivity of selected catalysts during long-term electrolysis was also investigated and it was shown that varying the catalyst composition via aerosol-based synthesis is a potential way to modulate the GOR selectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-0216			WOS:000790820900001

Diffusion-reaction modeling of silicon oxide interlayer growth during thermal annealing of high dielectric constant materials on silicon								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				77	20					205304	10.1103/PhysRevB.77.205304				MAY 2008	2008	We present the quantitative physicochemical modeling of the thermal annealing of high dielectric constant (k) thin films on silicon in oxygen and/or inert ambient. In particular, we study the kinetics of the SiO2 interfacial layer growth at the high-k material structure/Si interface. Upon annealing, the transport of oxygen species in the high-k film to the silicon interface is quantitatively evaluated. One-dimensional unsteady-state diffusion-reaction equations are used to model the time evolution of the interfacial SiO2 layer thickness. Because of the continuously increasing interfacial SiO2 layer, the proposed model incorporates the moving interface that alters the diffusion length of the oxygen species. The numerical solution of the resulting modeling equations is based on the finite volume analysis method and it results in SiO2 thickness profiles that comprise of an early fast growth stage followed by pseudo saturation into a self-limited regime. Our model predictions are found to satisfactorily agree with published experimental results. We also study the use of alumina as a potential oxygen diffusion barrier. Alumina is predicted to be an efficient barrier to oxygen diffusion, which is in agreement with published experimental data.									15	1	0	0	0	0	16			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000256971800060

Here a facile three-electrode electrolysis system is firstly applied to synthesize nickel hydroxide-iron hydroxide/graphene hybrid. To fully utilize the electrical energy and simplify the catalyst synthesis, we made graphite exfoliated into graphene at the cathode and nickel-iron hydroxide synthesized at the anode simultaneously. The best electrocatalytic performance of Ni-Fe/G for OER shows an overpotential of 280 mV (without iR compensation) at 10 mA cm(-2), superior to commercial RuO2 (341 mV). Results show that the introduction of Fe in Ni-Fe/G not only converts part of alpha-Ni(OH)(2) into more active beta-Ni(OH)(2), but promotes the electric conductivity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of the obtained Ni-Fe/G, therefore Ni-Fe/G shows the superior OER performance. The OER activity of Ni-Fe/G can be further adjusted by experiment conditions including electrolysis time and electrolyte concentration.

Here, we report a facile and ultrafast route to immobilize nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanoparticles on nickel foam (NF) via soaking the direct electroless deposited prussian blue analogue (PBA) on NF in 1 M KOH. This NiFe-LDH/NF electrode can be prepared in a few seconds without further treatments. It has three-dimensional interpenetrating network originated from its PBA precursor which facilitate the diffusion and ad/desorption of the reactants and producing for OER. And further characterization of the Faradaic efficiency and forced convection tests show direct evidence to demonstrate the formation of free intermediate(s) in the OER process. This electrode (typically NiFe-LDH-20s/NF) exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity with low overpotential of similar to 0.240 V at 10 mA cm(-2), low Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1), and great stability.

An initial consensus was reached on structural rearrangement, then leaned toward the newly discovered lattice oxygen activity. It is challenging to differentiate their explicit roles because these events typically coexist during the electrochemical reaction of most Li-rich layered oxides. Here, the voltage decay behavior is probed in Li1.2Ni0.2Ru0.6O2, a structurally and electrochemically relevant compound to Li, Mn-rich layered oxide, but of no oxygen activity. Such intriguing characteristics allow the explicit decoupling of the contribution of transition metal migration and lattice oxygen activity to voltage decay in Li-rich layered oxides. The results demonstrate that the microstructural evolution, mainly originating from transition metal migration, is a direct cause of voltage decay, and lattice oxygen activity likely accelerates the decay.									36	4	0	0	2	0	37			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000494543500001

Herein, the well-regulated NiFe bimetallic nanocages have been directly synthesized through the coordinated etching and precipitation (CEP) route, and then employed as advanced electrode materials in OER. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations disclosed that the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni significantly regulated the electron density and enhanced the conductivity. Significantly, the high catalytic activity of NiFe nanocages arises from the strong interactions between Fe and Ni along with rapid electron transfer, and the favorable structure with abundant porosity and large surface area. When employed as OER electrocatalysts, the electrode based on Ni2Fe1 nanocages exhibited a low overpotential of 280 mV at 10 mA center dot cmxe213; 2 combined with a low Tafel slop of 55.3 mV center dot decxe213; 1 and large Cdl (double layers capacitance) value of 2.33 mF center dot cmxe213; 2.

We report herein a rational preparation strategy for MOF-derived chalcogenide electrocatalysts. The optimal sulfuration time is 12 h under the conditions of the theoretical Fe/Ni ratio of 1:1 and treatment temperature at 120 degrees C. In this case, the pyrite Fe0.75Ni0.25S2 nanorods combining with amorphous FeNiOOH formed in situ exhibit a low overpotential of 247 mV with a small Tafel slope of 47.6 mV dec(-1) at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media along with high electrochemical stability for OER. The enhanced performance is derived from the synergistic effect between FeNi sulfide with favorable electrical conductivity and generated (oxy)hydroxides with high intrinsic activity. More importantly, the more active sites and appropriate mesoporous structure further facilitate electrocatalytic activity due to improved mass transfer. This facile synthesis method is a potential pathway for MOF derived highly efficient electrocatalysis for sustainable hydrogen product. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

A possible strategy to alleviate the cost of the anodic catalyst consists in synthesizing iridium oxide (IrOx) nanoparticles and dispersing them on an electron-conducting and highly-porous support such as SnO2 doped with hypervalent cations e.g. Sb(V) or Ta(V). Herein, we show the benefits of Sb- and Ta- doped SnO2 aerogels synthesized by a sol-gel route. The effect of the dopant nature on the aerogel's properties (as morphology, structure, conductivity, etc.) was investigated using a set of physical and chemical techniques.

All co-deposited thin films were simultaneously evaluated employing a multichannel potentiostat with Pt9Ni56Al35 exhibiting the highest current at 1.39 V (SHE). Subsequent deposition on a glassy carbon insert followed by electrochemical characterization revealed that Pt9Ni56Al35 performed better than its constituent components in that it exhibited an overpotential of 487 mV at 10 mA cm-2 compared to 590 mV, 941 mV, and 1379 mV for the overpotentials of vapour deposited Ni, Pt and Al respectively. Subsequent evaluation of co-deposited Pt9Ni56Al35, as an electrocatalyst on a nickel woven mesh anode inside a membraneless divergent electrode-flow-through (DEFTTM) alkaline electrolyser, resulted in a current density of 1198 mA cm-2 at a cell potential of 2 VDC. This represents the highest current density to date for a membraneless alkaline electrolyser.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000636269600001

This free-standing Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet was directly used to catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). At a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), the overpotential reached 295 mV (vs. RHE) in Fe-rich 1 M NaOH. This 1.4 nm Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet showed a very high turnover frequency of 5.47 s(-1) and a mass activity of more than 2 x 10(4) A g(-1) at an overpotential of 300 mV. Such a high electrocatalytic mass activity of the Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet was more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of typical OER catalysts. The capability of producing wafer-scale nanometer-thick nanosheets offers a promising strategy to improve the mass efficiency of electrochemical catalysts, which is particularly valuable for preserving rare and precious catalyst materials.									27	3	0	0	0	0	27			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428787200004	29487932

The intimate g-C3N4 coating layers (ca. 50-130 nm) on the surface of FeWO4 microcrystals were observed through transmission electron microscopy. An all-side evaluation of its performance toward typical photoassisted oxidation and reduction reactions was carried out, which exhibited drastically improved performance for photocatalytic oxygen production and photo degradation, while obviously suppressed hydrogen evolution activity when compared with the bulk g-C3N4 (CNU). The optimal photocatalyst CNU-FW90 (90 mg of FeWO4 in 15 g of urea) displayed an oxygen evolution rate of 303 mu mol/(g h), about 2.4 and 3.8 times as much as that of CNU and FeWO4, respectively. Not only that, CNU-FW90 showed superior degradation activity with a reaction kinetics rate constant of 0.1192 min(-1), nearly 5-fold higher than that of the pure CNU. By correlating the performance with the band structures and surface valence states of g-C3N4@FeWO4 heterojunctions, a possible mechanism was proposed to uncover the differences between oxidation and reduction reactions in this system, which highlighted the crucial role of Fe3+/Fe2+ couple in tuning the performance of photocatalytic reactions. This work put forward a promising strategy to design highly efficient semiconductor photocatalysts and shed light on the vital effect of surface valence state of Fe element in tuning the performance of Fe-related photocatalysts.									26	2	0	0	2	0	27			1932-7447			WOS:000436381600034

Herein, the rare-earth metal oxide modification strategy has been proposed to construct the highly efficient and ultra-stable catalysts for ZABs. Accordingly, a graphene oxide-doped carbon-supported Eu2O3-modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4/Eu2O3@NCG) catalyst is developed with layered Fe-Eu-MOF/GO as a precursor. Detailed characterization reveals that Fe3O4/Eu2O3@NCG possesses unique structural properties, including carbon-metal-carbon configuration, plentiful oxygen vacancies, and variable metal-active sites, which endows the catalyst with strong conductivity, high activity, and ultra-long stability. The optimal Fe3O4/Eu2O3@NCG catalyst exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance, and the potential difference (Egap) between oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction is merely 0.68 V at 0.1 M KOH condition. Moreover, density functional theory calculations are employed to investigate the reaction mechanism and the synergetic effect between Fe and Eu atoms. Most importantly, the Fe3O4/Eu2O3@NCG-based aqueous ZAB delivers a high power density (218 mW/cm(2)), specific capacity (854 mA h/g@5 mA/cm(2)), and an impressive ultra-long cycle property with more than 1000 h (> 6000 cycles) charge-discharge cycle life. In addition, the Fe3O4/Eu2O3@NCG-based all-solid-state ZAB also exhibits an outstanding performance, achieving > 460 h cycle life (> 2760 cycles) and strong practical application capability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000874852100001	35977406

However, under harsh operating conditions (550 degrees C similar to 700 degrees C containing CO2 and H2O), the application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in R-PSOCs is challenging due to the migration/agglomeration of isolated atoms and the lack of universal processing techniques for catalyst loading. Here, we firstly report a single-atom customizing strategy to create four-coordinated Pt-O-Ni (4) that selective anchors Pt atoms to the B site in Pr4Ni3O10+delta. The resultant SAC is thermally stable, controllable, and highly active for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, withstanding treatment at 700 degrees C for 800 h in air, and its electrochemical performance was improved by almost 100%. This work bridges the application gap between SACs and R-PSOCs, are amenable to the large-scale manufacture of stable, efficient, high-loading SACs for industrial applications, which can also be extended to Pd, Ir, Ru, and Fe SACs.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000817870200001

In this research, a composite of NiCo2O4 nanoparticles on BCN Nanotube is synthesized via a facile hydrothermal approach, and used as the bi-functional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in aprotic rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries. The asassembled Li-O-2 battery exhibits a low overpotential of 0.96 V, a high discharge capacity of 9823 mA h g(-1) and more importantly a remarkable cycling stability over 320 cycles under the controlled capacity of 1000 mA h g(-1). DFT calculations analyze the catalytic mechanism. It is found that the composite catalyst has an enhanced charge transfer at the interface between NiCo2O4 and BCN, which increases the electron conductivity and the activity site density of the catalyst, and thereby facilitates the reversible formation and decomposition of Li2O2 as well as the cycling of the battery. The electronic interface interaction presents an effective strategy for designing composite oxygen catalysts for high performance Li-O-2 batteries.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000624643700003

J. Chem. Phys. 2004, 121, 1725]. To do that, the 3D topology of the EPLF calculated with quantum Monte Carlo (at both variational and fixed-node-diffusion Monte Carlo levels) using Hartree-Fock, multiconfigurational CASSCF, and explicitly correlated trial wave functions is analyzed. At the O-4 equilibrium geometry the EPLF analysis reveals four equivalent covalent bonds and two lone pairs oil each oxygen atom. Along the reaction path toward dissociation it is found that the two oxygen-oxygen bonds are not broken simultaneously but sequentially, and then the lone pairs are rearranged. In a more general perspective, the usefulness of the EPLF as a unique tool to analyze the topology of electron pairing in nontrivial chemical bonding situations as well as to visualize the major steps involved in chemical reactivity is emphasized. In contrast with most standard schemes to reveal electron localization (atoms in molecules, electron localization function, natural bond orbital, etc.), the newly introduced EPLF function gives a direct access to electron pairings in molecules.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000268479200025	19719306

This article reviewed the investigation of the structure and electrochemical behavior for LRMO in recent years, especially the reaction of anionic redox that is the origin of the high capacity of LRMO. The inseparability between the anionic redox and crystal configuration has been emphasized from the perspective of electron and energy band structure, and the generation of non-bonding O 2p states is a prerequisite for anionic redox. A global understanding of the reaction and structural evolution of LRMO has been drawn through outlining the reversible retention and irreversible transformation of anionic redox. The support for the reversibility of the reaction comes from the maintenance of the O 2p state by the structural changes during the deintercalation process of lithium, but the disadvantage is voltage hysteresis. However, the irreversible O loss and phase transition caused by the surface oxygen evolution are the beginning of the degradation for LRMO, and the resulting voltage and capacity decay shackle the application of LRMO cathode materials critically. This article suggests that the coexistence of reversibility and irreversibility for anionic redox also points out the way for the modification of LRMO. We look forward to the steady application of LRMO in the field of high energy density batteries by modifying unstable oxygen.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2052-1553			WOS:000703964800001

The dual metal CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been regarded as one kind of most promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their excellent catalytic performance. However, fundamental understanding of the effect of Fe on OER performance of CoFe-LDHs is still unclear. In this work, we report a series of CoxFey-LDHs nanosheets with different doping amount of Fe ranging from 5% to 20% (molar ratio). We systematically characterize structure and morphology of obtained CoxFey-LDHs nanosheets. Electrochemical results demonstrate that the introduction of Fe can significantly improve catalytic activity of these CoxFey-LDHs for OER with a negative shift of > 70 mV compared to pure Co(OH)(2). Furthermore, optimized Co0.85Fe0.15-LDHs exhibits high intrinsic activity compared to other CoFe-LDHs nanosheets. The formation of CoIV=O species is the rate-determining step of OER for Co0.85Fe0.15-LDHs. Theoretical and experimental results indicate that CoxFey-LDHs exhibits enhanced conductivity and charge transfer compared to pure Co(OH)(2). This work provides a better understanding of the effect of Fe on the OER performance of CoxFey-LDHs nanosheets.

Herein, the method of introducing several different transition-metal atoms to tune the catalytic properties of 2D MBene is proposed. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the H-O bonding strength can be weakened by charge transfer between the oxygen atom and the introduced single-metal atom. The weakening of the bond greatly improves the MBene catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the Gibbs free energy (vertical bar Delta G(H)vertical bar) of W2B2O2 decreases from vertical bar-0.67 vertical bar to 0.013 eV by embedding a V adatom. This work should initiate 2D material MBene applications in green catalysis and energy sectors.									47	2	0	0	2	0	47			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000517360000030	32064860

Herein, we report a low-cost, highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst, Ru-CoFeP (Ru doped CoFeP nanocubes). The superior OER performance of Ru-CoFeP is ascribed to the synergistic effects of the Ru doping, porous structure and exposed active sites. Ru-CoFeP catalyst owns a small overpotential of 185 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a Tafel slope of 67.6 mV dec(-1) and a Cdl value of 9.1 mF cm(-2), which is much better than those of undoped CoFeP catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electrons would move toward to Ru after the Ru doping on the active CoFeP (111) surface and the adsorption capacity to H2O molecules is also strengthened to elongate and break O-H bond. The Ru-CoFeP + Pt/C based rechargeable Zn-air battery exhibits excellent stability with slightly increased/decreased potential after 450 cycles at the current density of 5 mA cm(-2), which shows a much better performance than that of RuO2+Pt/C battery. This work not only provides an efficient low-cost OER catalyst, but also demonstrates that Ru-doping would be a feasible strategy to enhance OER performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000800175000005

Herein, a hierarchically structured electrocatalyst was synthesized from biological waste (bovine serum albumin, BSA), integrating encapsulated Co nanoparticles and Co-N-C moieties. The obtained electrocatalysts exhibited superior activities for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), providing a small potential gap (Delta E) of 0.74 V between the ORR half-wave potential and the OER potential at 10 mA cm(-2). Furthermore, the aqueous and flexible quasi-solid-state zinc-air batteries assembled with these hierarchically structured composites demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance with maximum power densities of 173.7 mW cm(-2) and 79.6 mW cm(-2), as well as long-term cycling stability.

IrO2 nanoparticles were deposited in various loading on commercially available ITO nanoparticle, 17-28 nm in size using the Adam's fusion method. The prepared catalysts were characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The BET surface area of the support (35 m(2)/g) was 3 times lower than the unsupported IrO2 (112.7 m(2)/g). The surface area and electronic conductivity of the catalysts were predominantly contributed by the IrO2. The supported catalysts were tested in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for electrolyser operation. The 90% IrO2-ITO gave similar performance (1.74 V@1 A/cm(2)) to that of the unsupported IrO2 (1.73 V@1 A/cm(2)) in the MEA polarisation test at 80 degrees C with Nafion 115 membrane which was attributed to a better dispersion of the active IrO2 on the electrochemically inactive ITO support, giving rise to smaller catalyst particle and thereby higher surface area. Large IrO2 particles on the support significantly reduced the electrode performance. A comparison of TiO2 and ITO as support material showed that, 60% IrO2 loading was able to cover the support surface and giving sufficient conductivity to the catalyst.

TheScientificWorldJournal				2014				832850	832850		10.1155/2014/832850				2014	2014	Nonactivated and activated biochars have been successfully prepared by bananas at different thermotreatment temperatures. The activated biochar generated at 900°C (Biochar-act900) exhibited improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances in alkaline media, in terms of the onset potential and generated current density. Rotating disk electron result shows that the average of 2.65 electrons per oxygen molecule was transferred during ORR of Biochar-act900. The highest power density of 528.2 mW/m(2) and the maximum stable voltage of 0.47 V were obtained by employing Biochar-act900 as cathode catalyst, which is comparable to the Pt/C cathode. Owning to these advantages, it is expected that the banana-derived biochar cathode can find application in microbial fuel cell systems.									5	1	0	0	2	0	5				1537-744X		MEDLINE:25243229	25243229

To unravel some interesting parameters, we have synthesized metal oxides of cobalt and iron (i.e. Fe2O3, Co3O4, Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4), and measured the effect of the valence band structure, morphology, size and defects in the nanoparticles towards the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The compositional variations in the cobalt and iron precursors significantly alter the particle size from 60 to <10 nm and simultaneously the shape of the particles (cubic and spherical). The Tauc plot obtained from the solution phase ultraviolet (UV) spectra of the nanoparticles showed band gaps of 2.2, 2.3, 2.5 and 2.8 eV for Fe2O3, Co3O4, Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4, respectively. Further, the valence band structure and work function analysis using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and core level X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses provided better structural insight into metal oxide catalysts. In the Co3O4 system, the valence band structure favors the HER and Fe2O3 favors the OER. The composites Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4 show a significant change in their core level (O 1s, Co 2p and Fe 2p spectra) and valence band structure. Co3O4 shows an overpotential of 370 mV against 416 mV for Fe2O3 at a current density of 2 mA cm(-2) for the HER. Similarly, Fe2O3 shows an overpotential of 410 mV against the 435 mV for Co3O4 at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the OER. However, for the ORR, Co3O4 shows 70 mV improvement in the half-wave potential against Fe2O3. The composites (Co2FeO4 and CoFe2O4) display better performance compared to their respective parent oxide systems (i.e., Co3O4 and Fe2O3, respectively) in terms of the ORR half-wave potential, which can be attributed to the presence of the oxygen vacancies over the surface in these systems. This was further corroborated in density functional theory (DFT) simulations, wherein the oxygen vacancy formation on the surface of CoFe2O4(001) was calculated to be significantly lower (similar to 50 kJ mol(-1)) compared to Co3O4 (001). The band diagram of the nanoparticles constructed from the various spectroscopic measurements with work function and band gap provides in-depth understanding of the electrocatalytic process.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000870780900001	36268905

The typical EW that is carbonized at 650 degrees C (EW-650) possesses ultrahigh specific surface area of 1904 m2 g-1, large average pore diameter of 9.8 nm, high contents of doped heteroatoms (N, O and S), fairly high graphitization degree and dense defects, corresponding to dense active sites and excellent transportation of both mass and electrons. Therefore, the EW-650 shows higher activity than commercial Pt/C for ORR in both alkaline and acidic media even at higher mass loadings, with excellent cyclic stability. The effects of reaction temperature and electrolyte concentration on ORR activity are also studied. It is found that appropriate temperature and electrolyte concentration speed up ORR kinetics, ensure higher oxygen solubility and favor mass transportation.(c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Herein, two phosphonitrilic-bridged metal porphyrin porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) were developed for HER. Compared to CoTPP-PCTCOP, NiTPP-PCTCOP exhibits relative low overpotentials of 140 to reach 10 mA cm-2 for HER in alkaline medium, which is comparable to many previously reported state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. The enhanced HER activity of NiTPP-PCTCOP is associated with its chemical composition and special push-pull structure. Long-term stability analysis of NiTPP-PCTCOP shows that the current density exhibits no obvious deactivation over a long time test. This work demonstrates an effective technique to develop promising HER electrocatalysts, highlighting its advantages by combing phosphonitrilic chloride trimer with metal porphyrins.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-7208	1873-3743		WOS:000862829700001

The catalysts were deposited on glassy carbon electrode (GCE), and their electro-catalytic activity for hydrogen production in alkaline media by electrolysis was investigated. The electrocatalytic activity of the catalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) decreased in the following order Ni0.1Co0.9Py>Ni0.2Co0.8Oy>Ni0.5Co0.5Sy>Ni0.1Co0.9-ZIF-67. The Ni0.1Co0.9Py exhibited the highest electrocatalytic activity towards HER due to the high crystallinity, high specific surface area and the synergistic effect of nickel and cobalt that accelerate the electron transfer process.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000487618500001

Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the strong catalyst-support interaction between RuO2 and the WC support could optimize the surrounding electronic structure of Ru sites to reduce the reaction barrier. Considering the likewise excellent catalytic ability for hydrogen production, an acidic overall water splitting (OWS) electrolyzer with a good stability constructed by bifunctional RuO2-WC NPs only requires a cell voltage of 1.66 V to afford 10 mA cm(-2). The unique 0D/2D nanoarchitectures rationally combining a WC support with precious metal oxides provides a promising strategy to tradeoff the high catalytic activity and low cost for acidic OWS applications.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000772002300001	35266633

However, at present, simultaneous modulations of these three parameters for alkaline HER still remain challenging. In this work, we take CoP as the model material and demonstrate that a metal and nonmetal dual-doping strategy can achieve simultaneous modulation of these three parameters by inducing lattice irregularity and optimizing the electronic configuration in CoP nanomaterials. Benefiting from the oxygen and copper dual-doping collective effect, the optimized O,Cu-CoP nanowire array electrode shows nearly 10-fold enhancement in catalytic activity for alkaline HER compared to a pure CoP nanowire electrode. Our work may provide a new concept to boost performance of nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.									104	6	0	0	8	0	106			2380-8195			WOS:000450374600017

In this work, taking the widely investigated nickel (Ni) based nonprecious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst as an example, for the first time, it is reported that the crystal structure plays a critical role in determining the OER performance. Similar-sized nickel nanoparticles but in different hexagonal close-packed phase and face-centered cubic phase coated with N-doped carbon shells, noted as hcp-Ni@NC and fcc-Ni@NC, are successfully prepared, respectively, in which the N-coated carbon shell structures were also similar. Surprisingly, a dramatically enhanced OER performance of hcp-Ni@NC in comparison with fcc-Ni@NC is observed. The hcp-Ni@NC only requires 305 mV overpotential to achieve the current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is 55 mV lower than that of fcc-Ni@NC, which can be ascribed to the influence of nickel crystal phase on the electron structure of N-doped carbon shell. This finding will bring new thinking toward the rational design of high performance non-noble metal electrocatalysts.									19	3	0	0	0	0	20			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000446463300018	30260570

However, addressing this issue depends on the development of efficient electrocatalyst design to replace precious platinum catalysts. Herein, we construct cobalt-phosphonate coordination polymer nanosheets bioinspired by active center engineering and coordination environments of catalytic sites in natural enzymes, which catalyze HER at an overpotential of 84 mV under neutral conditions. We propose that the introduction of a phosphate group tunes the electron density of the cobalt ion center and synergistically accelerates HER in a bifunctional activation mechanism of water molecules. This research sheds light on the relationship between the electrocatalyst structures and their catalytic activities, a concept that has broad implications for the design of efficient electrocatalysts in energy conversion.									59	6	0	0	1	0	61			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300020

It could be produced in a sustainable manner via water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. The widespread application of this technology, however, is hindered by several factors, with a prominent bottleneck in the scale-up of hydrogen production represented by the reliance on rare and expensive catalysts based on platinum-group metals (PGMs). Consequently, enormous research effort is directed at the reduction or even replacement of these Critical Raw Materials in the catalysts.

The model is a thermally coupled continuum model based on the single-particle model and is based upon a LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) layered oxide in this instance. The theoretical framework assumes a shrinking core mechanism, where lattice oxygen, [O], release occurs at the interface between the bulk and the passivation layer, and the rate of reaction is controlled by either [O]-diffusion through the passivation layer or the reaction kinetics at the interface. As the passivation layer grows, the core of active positive electrode material shrinks giving rise to both loss in active material (LAM) and loss in lithium inventory (LLI) through trapping lithium in the passivation layer, giving rise to capacity fade. The slower diffusion of lithium through the passivation layer also gives rise to power fade. The model predicts two limiting cases, "diffusion dominated" if [O]-diffusion is slow, and "reaction dominated" if [O]-diffusion is fast, relative to the reaction rate of [O]-release and also the thickness of the passivation layer.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000617479400001

Heteroatom doping, especially two heteroatoms co-doping, is one of the most effective strategies to improve the catalytic activity of carbon-based electrocatalysts. Here, we reported that the plasma-etching could produce additional structural defects on N, S co-doped graphene (NSG), which further improved the HER activity of NSG. It was demonstrated that the synergetic coupling effect of N, S co-doping and plasma-induced structural defects could maximize the number of exposed active sites and significantly enhance the HER activity of graphene in both acidic and alkaline media. This study thus indicates that combining defect engineering with heteroatoms co-doping is an efficient strategy for dramatically improving the HER activity of graphene. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we rationally synthesized a cost-effective Co3S4@MoS2 hetero-structured catalyst that has proven to be a highly active and stable bifunctional catalyst for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment. The heterostructure was obtained via a first hydrothermal approach to obtain hollow Co3S4 nanoboxes based on the ionic exchange reaction between Fe(CN)(6)(3-) of Co-Fe Prussian blue analogue (PBA) and S2- at 120 degrees C, and the subsequent in situ growth of MoS2 nanosheets on the surface of Co3S4 nanoboxes at an elevated temperature of 200 degrees C. The synergistic effects between the active and stable HER catalyst of MoS2 and the efficient OER catalyst of Co3S4, as well as the morphological superiority of hollow and core-shell structures, endow Co3S4@MoS2 with remarkable electrocatalytic performance and robust durability toward overall water splitting. As a result, the designed non-noble electrocatalyst of Co3S4@MoS2 exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV for OER and 136 mV for HER at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline solution. Meanwhile, a low cell voltage of 1.58 V is achieved by using the heterostructure as both anode and cathode catalysts.

Here, we demonstrate the power of this strategy using well-defined thermally prepared Ir-Ni mixed oxide thin film catalysts for the electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under highly corrosive conditions such as in acidic proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers and photoelectrochemical cells (PEC). Variation of the Ir to Ni ratio resulted in a volcano type OER activity curve with an unprecedented 20-fold improvement in Jr mass-based activity over pure Ir oxide. In situ spectroscopic probing of metal dissolution indicated that, against common views, activity and stability are not directly anticorrelated. To uncover activity and stability controlling parameters, the Ir-Ni mixed thin oxide film catalysts were characterized by a wide array of spectroscopic, microscopic, scattering, and electrochemical techniques in conjunction with DFT theoretical computations. By means of an intuitive model for the formation of the catalytically active state of the bimetallic Ir-Ni oxide surface, we identify the coverage of reactive surface hydroxyl groups as a suitable descriptor for the OER activity and relate it to controllable synthetic parameters. Overall, our study highlights a novel, highly active oxygen evolution catalyst; moreover, it provides novel important insights into the structure and performance of bimetallic oxide OER electrocatalysts in corrosive acidic environments.									442	17	0	0	32	0	444			0002-7863			WOS:000363002900045	26355767

In this paper, we report a facile synthesis to develop cobal-tmanganese-oxide (MnxCo3-xO4, CMO) nanorods via an oxalate precipitation method followed by annealing at different temperatures. Importantly, morphology and surface area of the CMO nanorods, which are directly related to the OER activity, can be precisely controlled by changing annealing temperatures. The CMO nanorods engineered by oxalate precipitation and subsequent heat treatment show promising OER catalytic performance, such as a small overpotential of 365 mV for generating a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 50.6 mV dec(-1), and excellent long-term stability in alkaline media. Electrochemical properties combined with materials characterization provide insightful information on the OER mechanism of the CMO nanorods.

Here, the synthesis, structural characterization, and electrochemical performance of Ni/Co mixed oxide nanocrystals in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported and the influence of nanoscaling on their composition and solubility range is investigated. Using a solvothermal synthesis in tert-butanol ultrasmall crystalline and highly dispersible NixCo1-xO nanoparticles with rock salt type structure are obtained. The mixed oxides feature non-equilibrium phases with unusual miscibility in the whole composition range, which is attributed to a stabilizing effect of the nanoscale combined with kinetic control of particle formation. Substitutional incorporation of Co and Ni atoms into the rock salt lattice has a remarkable effect on the formal potentials of NiO oxidation that shift continuously to lower values with increasing Co content. This can be related to a monotonic reduction of the work function of (001) and (111)-oriented surfaces with an increase in Co content, as obtained from density functional theory (DFT+U) calculations. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic performance of the NixCo1-xO nanoparticles in water splitting changes significantly. OER activity continuously increases with increasing Ni contents, while HER activity shows an opposite trend, increasing for higher Co contents. The high electrocatalytic activity and tunable performance of the nonequilibrium NixCo1-xO nanoparticles in HER and OER demonstrate great potential in the design of electrocatalysts for overall water splitting.									59	2	0	0	1	0	59			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000394683400004

On the basis of transition metal phosphides (TMPs), we developed a method to engineer well-dispersed NiCoP nanoparticles by introducing carbon nanotubes on Ni Foam (CNT/NF) as a high active electrocatalyst for HER. The obtained catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and the catalytic activity was evaluated by electrochemical technique. The as-prepared NiCoP/CNT/NF electrode exhibits efficient electrocatalytic activity towards HER with an onset overpotential of 69 mV and a small Tafel slope in 1 M KOH. These results suggest the possibility for creating binder-free CNTs supported and element doped electrode in electrochemical water splitting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

By the use of cyclic voltammetry, the ECA of a platinum electrocatalyst is measured by hydrogen adsorption. In the procedure, the charge used to form one monolayer of hydrogen is measured. The determination is influenced by the hydrogen evolution reaction and an accurate procedure is needed. Therefore, the hydrogen adsorption is modelled by three Frumkin-like adsorption isotherms. By performing a simulation of the measured cyclic voltammetry curves in the hydrogen adsorption potential region (hydride region), it has been possible to obtain a very accurate measure for the electrochemical active area. In this way, the current originating from the hydrogen evolution reaction can be sorted out. The procedure is used to characterise two different oxygen reduction electrodes both prepared from the same Pt/C catalyst with Nafion((R)) as binder. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Secondly, the characterization of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of coal char is analyzed.And the FT-IR peak of semi-coke is fitted and calculated.Finally,combining the calculation parameters with the law of pyrolysis gas generation, the mechanisms of gas generation in each reaction stage during pyrolysis heating and the evolution law of coal structure in the process of gas generation were proposed.The results show that SL has abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl,aliphatic hydrocarbon,aromatic ring,carbonyl and ether bond.And the main functional groups in lignite have not changed,when the pyrolysis is below 350 ℃.Aliphatic oxygen-containing functional groups are decomposed between 350 and 450 ℃.The C=O relative content (C_1) at the pyrolysis final temperature of 450 ℃ is 78% lower than that of 350 ℃.When the pyrolysis temperature is between 560 and 800 ℃, the pyrolysis reaction is mainly based on the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups of aromatic alkyl side chains.And the CO relative content (C_2) at the pyrolysis final temperature of 800 ℃ is 27% lower than that of 450 ℃.At 710-800 ℃ range, the main pyrolysis reaction is polycondensation.The aromatic condensation (D_2) of chars at a final pyrolysis temperature of 800 ℃ is 65% higher than that at 710 ℃.Four kinds of pyrolysis gas generation processes were studied and analyzed that CO_2 is mainly derived from the decomposition of carboxyl functional groups of different structures in the middle and low temperature zone.CO is generated in the high temperature,which is derived from the decomposition of the structures of phenol,ether and oxygen containing heterocyclic rings in coal.The decomposition of CH_4 is mainly from the aromatic ring or methylene connecting the aromatic rings.The approximate 60% H_2 mainly comes from the polycondensation reaction of aromatic structures in coal at a high-temperature zone.			褐煤的热解反应是褐煤利用的重要研究方向之一。为了分析褐煤热解过程中结构演变及气体生成机理,首先将胜利褐煤(SL)在固定床上进行热解制焦,利用800 ℃时SL热解气体生成速率曲线选取半焦终温,同时用气相色谱在线检测其所生成的热解气;其次结合煤焦傅里叶变换红外光谱(FT-IR)的表征进行分析,将半焦的FT-IR分峰拟合计算;最后将计算参数结合热解气生成规律,提出了热解升温过程中各反应阶段生成气体机理和气体生成过程中煤体结构的演变规律。结果表明,SL具有羟基、脂肪烃、芳环、羰基、醚键等丰富的官能团,热解温度低于350 ℃,胜利褐煤中主要官能团未发生明显变化; 350~ 450 ℃,脂肪族侧链含氧官能团分解,热解温度450 ℃比350 ℃时煤焦中C=O相对含量(C_1)降低78%; 560~ 800 ℃,热解反应主要以芳香烷基侧链含氧官能团裂解为主,热解温度800 ℃时煤焦中CO相对含量(C_2)比560 ℃时降低27%;热解温度710~800 ℃时,煤热解以缩聚反应为主,热解温度800 ℃煤焦中芳香稠和度(D_2)比710 ℃时升高65%。对4种热解气生成过程进行研究分析,CO_2主要来源于中低温区煤中不同结构的羧基官能团分解;高温区生成CO,来源于煤中酚类、醚类、含氧杂环等结构的分解; CH_4主要由芳环侧链的甲基、亚甲基或连接芳环结构亚甲基的分解;高温区产生的约60%H_2主要来自于煤中芳香结构的缩聚反应。						2	4	0	0	0	0	6			0253-9993			CSCD:6456385

Ruthenium dioxide is among the most active catalysts for OER in acid, but the activity at low overpotentials can be difficult to measure due to high capacitance. In this work, we use electrochemistry - mass spectrometry to obtain accurate OER activity measurements spanning six orders of magnitude on a model series of ruthenium-based catalysts in acidic electrolyte, quantifying electrocatalytic O-2 production at potential as low as 1.30 V-RHE. We show that the potential-dependent O-2 production rate, i.e., the Tafel slope, exhibits three regimes, revealing a previously unobserved Tafel slope of 25 mV decade(-1) below 1.4 V-RHE. We fit the expanded activity data to a microkinetic model based on potential-dependent coverage of the surface intermediates from which the rate-determining step takes place. Our results demonstrate how the familiar quantities "onset potential" and "exchange current density" are influenced by the sensitivity of the detection method.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000776270900001	35706423

Methoxy is detected following adsorption of CH3OH at 100 K using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. On clean Fe(110), methoxy dehydrogenates ar similar to 400 K, yielding gaseous H-2 and CO. The hydroxyl hydrogens leave the surface as H-2 at slightly lower temperature. 375 K, based on isotopic labeling experiments. Carbon-oxygen bond scission competes with CO evolution at 400 K, accounting for ca 25% of th, CO yield on clean Fe(110). Surface oxygen inhibits O-H and C-H bond dissociation in methanol leading to a decrease in the total amount of reaction and an increase in the amount of methanol desorbed from the surface with increasing oxygen coverage. At coverages greater than one monolayer (ML), there is no detectable reaction of methanol. In addition, the temperature required for C-H bond activation in methoxy increases to 475 K for an initial oxygen coverage of 0.75 ML. Surprisingly. the ratio of C-O bond dissociation to retention increases as a function of initial oxygen coverage. The increase ill C-O bond dissociation is tentatively attributed to defects in mixed phases of FeO(lll) and Fr(110)-c(3 x 1)-O, based on comparison with STM data taken from the literature. The potential implications of the different reactivity of methanol as a function of oxygen coverage with regard to the function of lubricant additives is discussed.

However, the fundamental insights about the structural evolution of RuO2 under different electrochemical environments remain unclear. Herein, the molecular reaction pathways of the electroreduction of RuOx in alkaline and neutral conditions are identified using in-situ electrochemical surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy. Au@RuO2 core-shell nanostructures are fabricated to amplify the Raman signals of species adsorbed on RuOx surfaces. Using such core-shell nanostructures, direct spectroscopic evidences of OH intermediate during the RuO2 electroreduction process are obtained, which is further confirmed by D2O isotopic substitution experiments. A molecular pathway that RuO2 is reduced to Ru through a two-step reduction process has been proposed.

Recently, fast sintering methods have demonstrated great potential in reducing ceramic sintering time and energy use, improving the commercial prospects of these materials. In this article, a quenched ultrafast high-temperature sintering (qUHS) technique is developed to sinter metastable brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 (SCO) in less than a minute. Surprisingly, SCO fabricated by qUHS shows higher activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) than solid-state-reaction-synthesized SCO. Comparing samples produced by these two techniques, the increased OER performance of SCO qUHS is likely due to the synergistic combination of surface Co chemical state, higher mesoporosity, and enhanced hydroxyl ion (OH-) adsorption. This work demonstrates the potential of qUHS for producing high-performance electrocatalysts and provides detailed insights into the impact of ultrafast sintering on the materials' physical properties and electrocatalytic activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000776069800001

Here we developed metal-carbon nanotubes (M-CNTs) hybrids with high metal oxide catalyst loading synthesized by arc-discharge and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods as electrocatalysts for OER in alkaline solutions. The M-CNTs hybrids produced by arc-discharge (M-CNTs-Arc) and CVD (M-CNTs-CVD) exhibit a core-shell-like structure, in which metal nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated by graphite shells are connected by carbon nanotubes (CNTs), forming M-CNTs network hybrids. M-CNTs-Arc has NiCo0.16Fe0.34 metal core and shows very high activity and superior stability for OER, achieving 100 A g(-1) at an overpotential (eta) of 0.29 V and 500 A g(-1) at eta = 0.37 V in 1 M KOH solution. This is probably the highest activity reported for OER in alkaline solutions. The reaction follows the first-order kinetics with respect to OH- concentration and Tafel slope of 34 mV dec(-1).

Herein, a polymerizable complexation method is employed to enable Al3+ uniformly enter into SrTiO3 lattice for reducing Ti3+, and substituting Ti4+ with the formation of oxygen vacancy. Thus, the photogenerated carrier transport is promoted, and the resulting appropriate surface oxygen vacancy is also conducive to the adsorption of water molecules and OH*. The optimized 2% Al3+-doped SrTiO3 possesses a lower Ti3+ concentration, compared with the same sample prepared by the solid-phase griding method. Consequently, 2% Al-STO sample deposited co-catalysts achieves the highest activity and durability with the H-2 and O-2 evolution rates of 1.256 mmol.h(-1) and 0.692 mmol.h(-1) (0.04 g catalyst), respectively, corresponding to the AQE value of 55.46% at 365 nm. The characterizations and DFT calculation results reveal that the uniform Al3+ doping promotes the increase in the surface oxygen vacancy, which is beneficial for accelerating the reduction reaction and facilitating carrier separation and migration, therefore enhancing the overall water splitting reaction.

J	Sun, Yongkai; Liu, Ting; Li, Zhenjiang; Meng, Alan; Li, Guicun; Wang, Lei; Li, Shaoxiang								Morphology and interfacial charge regulation strategies constructing 3D flower-like Co@CoP2 heterostructure electrocatalyst for efficient overall water splitting								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				433						133684	10.1016/j.cej.2021.133684				APR 1 2022	2022	Transition metal phosphide (TMP) is one of the most potential electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), whereas it is still immensely challenging to construct TMP-based catalyst that performs the excellent catalytic activity for both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through the proper regulation strategies. Herein, the morphology and interfacial charge regulation strategies were proposed to construct 3D flower-like Co@CoP2 heterostructure electrocatalyst grown in situ on copper foam (CF) for HER and OER. The influence of the phytic acid concentration on the product morphology and composition was systematic investigation. The flower-like Co@CoP2 Mott-Scottky heterostructure grown on CF (Co@CoP2/CF(1:1)) prepared under the optimal conditions shows the eminent electrocatalytic activity of HER with an overpotential of 55 mV and OER with an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline solution. Remarkably, Co@CoP2/CF (1:1)//Co@CoP2/CF(1:1) electrolyzer displays a prominent overall water splitting performance with a voltage of 1.54 V at the current density of 10 mA cm-2, and maintained excellent stability over a period of 100 h operating in 1 M KOH, which is superior to the almost all the reported non-noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. Various ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations manifested that the superior electrocatalytic performance of Co@CoP2/CF (1:1) was attributed to high P content, more important, the unique flowerlike morphology and the efficient regulation of interfacial charge drived by the Mott-Scottky effect. This work offers a universal regulation strategy for improve electrocatalytic activity, and opens up a new way for the exploitation of the efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000774061100002

Porous NiCo foam showed remarkable electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and methanol oxidation-assisted hydrogen production in an alkaline electrolyte. NiCo foam displayed just 85 mV of overpotential for HER to get a current density of 50 mA cm(-2), 290 mV of overpotential for OER to attain 20 mA cm(-2) of current density in 1 M KOH. In addition, NiCo foam exhibited good selectivity for methanol oxidation to yield valuable formate product by applying a potential of 1.33 V for 20 mA cm(-2) with the co-generation of hydrogen gas in alkaline methanol-water solution due to excellent electronic conductivity, high internal reactive surface areas, profiting electrolyte accessibility, and effective mass transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface of this foam. Furthermore, this electrocatalyst demonstrated bifunctional activities, requiring just 1.67 V and 1.47 V to attain 20 mA cm(-2) of current density for overall bifunctional water splitting and methanol-assisted water splitting, respectively. This work emphasizes the favorable impact of self-supported interconnected metallic porous networks with bimetallic synergistic effect and high surface area on the advancement of more effective electrocatalysts for water splitting and energy saving hydrogen production.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000773484000002

Developing new strategies to improve their electrochemical performance of TMSs is of great significance. Herein, a unique pacman-like titanium-doped cobalt sulfide hollow superstructure (Ti-CoSx HSS) is fabricated as an OER electrocatalyst. Using a prearranged metal-organic framework (MOF)-on-MOF heterostructure as a precursor treated by one-pot sulfidation, a sequential structural conversion process leads to the formation of Ti-CoSx HSS, which is assembled by interconnected Ti-doped CoSx nanocages around a cake-like cavity. Benefiting from the architecture and compositional advantages, Ti-CoSx HSS exhibits excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 249 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and Tafel slope of 45.5 mV dec(-1) due to increased active site exposure, enhanced electron and mass transfer. This strategy enabled by MOF-on-MOF paves the way toward innovative MOF derivatives for various applications.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000716487200001	34758099

High surface area SnO2:F was prepared initially using CTAB as a surfactant. (Ir,Sn)O-2:F was then synthesized by forming a solid state solution with IrCl4 and SnO2:F followed by heat-treatment in air at 400 degrees C. The catalyst was then coated onto a porous Ti foil and has been studied as a promising anode electro-catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in PEM based water electrolysis. The optimal composition of (Ir0.3Sn0.7)O-2:10 wt% F displayed electrochemical activity comparable to the commercially available pure IrO2 demonstrating similar to 70 mol% reduction in noble metal content.

Herein, a three-dimensional (3D) porous nickel foam electrode (NiFe(OH)(x) NSs/Ni-f) modified with Ni-Fe hydroxide nanosheets (NSs) is prepared by using a fast and facile electrodeposition method. The electrode is subsequently applied in the electrolysis of Na2CO/NaHCO3 to produce hydrogen, oxygen, NaOH, and NaHCO3/CO2. By carefully controlling the electrodeposition time, ultrathin NiFe(OH) x NSs with a thickness of approximately 2-6 nm are interlaced with one another and grown vertically on nickel foam to form a hierarchical composite electrode. The prepared NiFe(OH)(x) NSs/Nif electrode exhibits superb OER performance with an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mAcm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 29 mVdec(-1) in 1 molL(-1) NaOH solution. In 0.5 molL(-1) Na2CO3/NaHCO3 solution, the NiFe (OH)(x) NSs/Nif electrode exhibits a low OER potential of 290 mV, which is lower than the commercial RuO2/Ti electrode at a current density of 100 mAcm(-2), and shows good long-term stability. During electrolysis of Na2CO3/NaHCO3, the cell voltage with the NiFe(OH)(x) NSs/Nif anode is 2.52 V, which is 280 mV lower than that with a commercial RuO2/Ti anode.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			2196-0216			WOS:000404604300011

The high working potential and the corrosive environment pose severe challenges for developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To date, iridium (Ir)-based materials, largely metallic Ir and Ir-based oxides, are the most suitable OER electrocatalysts for PEMWEs due to their balanced activity and durability. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to improving the specific activity of Ir species to reduce the cost; however, advances in enhancing the durability of Ir-based electrocatalysts are rather limited. In this review, the recent research progress on tackling the stability issues of Ir-based OER electrocatalysts in acid media is summarized, aiming to provide inspiration for designing highly active and stable Ir-based electrocatalysts. The OER mechanism and the associated failure modes of active Ir species are summarized. Then, mechanistic studies on the dissolution behavior of Ir species and experimental attempts on enhancing the durability of Ir-based electrocatalysts are discussed. The personal perspectives for future studies on Ir-based OER electrocatalysts are also provided.									17	0	0	0	1	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000707863900001

However, most of these catalysts have the poor electrical conductivity and superhydrophobicity which seriously restrict their practical applications. In this paper, an amino-functionalized iron-based MOF modified FeCo(OH)(x) (denoted as Am-FeCo(OH)(x)) hybrid is fabricated via the simultaneous operation of the etching for iron-based MOF octahedron and the coprecipitation for the metal cation in the etchants. Compared to iron-based MOF and hydroxide, Am-FeCo(OH)(x) hierarchical architecture manifested the enhanced catalytic activity and hydrophilicity, which can be attributed to the more exposed active sites, the accelerating access of electrolytes, the promoted proton-coupled electron transfer capability and the efficient release of gas bubbles. The optimized Am-FeCo(OH)(x) exhibited an excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 257 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and robust electrochemical stability with no obvious degradation over 16 h. This work provides an effective methodology for rational design of other hydrophilic hydroxide composites targeting the electrocatalysts with high performance for water splitting.

The surface electronic structure of graphene can significantly affect the OER performance, which depends on the types of encapsulated metal and their proportion but it still lacks efficient methods to modulate them. Herein, we report a universal strategy to encapsulate FeNi binary metal nanoalloy within ultrathin graphene layers, which can efficiently optimize the electronic properties and the OER activity on the graphene surface via modulating Fe/Ni ratio. The optimized catalyst with Fe/Ni of 1 shows a low overpotential of 280 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Both the catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst are better than the commercial IrO2. Theoretical calculations indicate that the adsorption strength of each intermediate on graphene can be optimally balanced by modulating the metal proportion of the encapsulated FeNi, leading to an enhanced OER activity with reduced overpotential on the graphene surface.									104	12	0	0	6	0	107			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000444859700051

Herein, a novel and high-efficient OER catalyst was reported with nitrogen-doped oxide/sulfide heterostructures (named N-NiCo2S4/CoO microsphere). The N-NiCo2S4/CoO microsphere was synthesized by annealing NiCo-BTC MOF to a multi-layered hollow structure of NiCo2O4 microspheres, followed by the direct vulcanization in the presence of NH4HCO3, resulting in an oxide/sulfide heterojunction. Benefiting from the nitrogen doping, the abundant multi-layered hollow heterostructure and the interfaces between multiple components, the N-NiCo2S4/CoO microsphere exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). The Zn-air battery based on the N-NiCo2S4/CoO + Pt/C catalyst displayed excellent cycling stability after 900 cycles at a large current density of 5 mA cm(-2), where the commercial RuO2 + Pt/C-based battery exhibited a big drop after only 30 cycles, suggesting its great application prospects as power source devices.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000610368100025	33351010

This silica modified amorphous titania (TiO2-SiO2) composite material is prepared by facile spurting of silica (obtained from a sustainable resource) over a titanium plate and identified as an active electrocatalyst for O-2 and H-2 evolution by water oxidation. The prepared composite shows a maximum current density of 12 mA cm(-2) at 2 V (versus RHE) in 1 M KOH electrolyte. This is because the semiconductor heterostructure of the structurally and chemically dissimilar amorphous TiO2-SiO2 composite introduces new collective electronic states with improved electrical conductivity, with a decrease in the work function. The catalytic activity is found to be stable in continuous operation for about 10 h. The physicochemical characterization of the electrocatalyst was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-rays, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and electron paramagnetic resonance and the work function was examined by a Scanning Kelvin Probe. Because of the simple, cheap, and scalable preparation procedure, the electrocatalyst is highly promising for practical low cost and high technology applications. Interestingly, the system is active in the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions, leading to a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst.									21	0	0	0	1	0	21			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000363230200017

For tackling this problem, numerous advanced electrocatalysts have been proposed and tested in aqueous model systems. There are, however, increasing and evident concerns regarding the value of stability data coming from such studies. Hence, we anticipate that finding new approaches to assess degradation will be a major undertaking in electrocatalysis research in the next years. Specifically, existing differences between fundamental and actual systems have to be addressed first: (a) electrode architecture; (b) electrolyte; (c) reactant and product transport; and (d) operating conditions. In this perspective, we discuss their influence on the stability of electrocatalysts using the challenging oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions as illustrative cases.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			2451-9103			WOS:000704374600011

Here, single-particle collision electrochemistry is used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of a single IrOx nanoparticle towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The collision frequency is linearly proportional to the nanoparticle concentration. The mean peak current and transferred charge, extracted from current spikes of the collision, present a similar potential dependence relevant to IrOx intrinsic activity. The turnover frequency (TOF) is determined as 1.55 x 10(2) O-2 s(-1), which is orders of magnitude larger than TOFs of the reported ensemble systems. In addition, the deactivation of a single IrOx nanoparticle is also explored based on a half-width analysis of current spikes. This versatilely applicable method provides new insights into the intrinsic performance of a single nanoparticle, which is essential to reveal the structure-activity relations of nanoscale materials for the rational design of advanced catalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000589051700005	33140807

The metallic Ru films were prepared by electrodeposition on a Ti substrate and then thermally oxidized at various temperatures under atmospheric conditions. During long-term operation of the OER with cyclic voltammetry (CV) in H2SO4 electrolyte, changes in the properties of the Ru and its thermal oxides were monitored in terms of their morphology, crystal structure, and electronic structure. In the initial stages of the OER, all of the Ru thermal oxide films underwent an activation process that was related to the continuous removal of low-activity Ru oxides from the surface. With further cycling, the OER activity decreased. The rate of decrease was different for each Ru film and was related to the annealing temperatures. Monitoring of material properties indicates that the amount of stable anhydrous RuO2 is important for OER stability because it prevents both the severe dissolution of metallic Ru beneath the oxide surface and the formation of a less active hydrous RuO2 at the surface.

In such conditions, a full monolayer of upd Pb corresponds to a coverage of 0.41. The adsorption of lead inhibits the adsorption of hydrogen in a non-selective way. This behavior was explained through the comparison between the radius of the ad-atom and the substrate. It was calculated that each Pb ad-atom occupies two sites in the surface. Additionally it is shown that the presence of upd Pb significantly inhibits the oxygen reduction reaction. This effect was associated to the formation of H2O2 as the final product, instead of H2O.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			0013-4686			WOS:A1994QA03300016

Herein, CuCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated by nitrogen-doped carbonaceous nanoleaves (CuCo-NC) have been synthesized from a Cu(OH)(2)/2D leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L)-pyrolysis approach. Leaf-like Cu(OH)(2) is first prepared by the ultrasound-induced self-assembly of Cu(OH)(2) nanowires. The efficient encapsulation of Cu(OH)(2) in ZIF-L is obtained owing to the morphology fitting between the leaf-like Cu(OH)(2) and ZIF-L. CuCo-NC catalysts present superior electrocatalytic activity and stability toward ORR and OER over the commercial Pt/C and IrO2, respectively, which are further used as bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts in Zn-air batteries and exhibit impressive performance, with a high peak power density of 303.7 mW cm(-2), large specific capacity of up to 751.4 mAh g(-1) at 20 mA cm(-2), and a superior recharge stability.									29	3	0	0	1	0	31			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000485113400001	31265180

However, the poor electrochemical conductivity (similar to 10(-4) S/cm) of nanostructures restricts practical application for overall electrocatalytic activity. Herein, continuously networked nanostructures of phase-tuned nickel sulfide foams for efficient water splitting electrocatalysts in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes are reported. Because continuously networked nanostructures of nickel sulfide foams possess an integral structure, they exhibit high electrochemical conductivity (similar to 1 S/cm), which eases adsorption/desorption of H+ and OH- ions for efficient overall water splitting. By tuning the stoichiometry of sulfur, four different phases of continuously networked nanostructures of nickel sulfides (alpha NiS, beta NiS, Ni3S2, and Ni7S6) foams are formed by facile phase transformation of nickel. Among them, the Ni7S6 foam (Ni7S6-F) possesses superior electrocatalytic activity with extremely low overpotential of 70 mV (for hydrogen evolution reaction) and 1.37 V (for oxygen evolution reaction) at 10 mA/cm(2) in acidic and alkaline medium, respectively, which is close to noble-metal-based electrocatalysts. As a result, this work demonstrates a facile synthesis route to optimize nickel sulfide electrocatalysts through phase-tuning and continuous networking for overall water splitting and would be applicable on other nanostructured electrocatalysts to improve their electrocatalytic activity for practical applications in future energy devices.									29	0	0	0	1	0	29			2574-0970			WOS:000483440400042

Emphasis was given to the mechanism of ORR on these electrocatalysts. The influence of catalyst surface structure on the catalysis of ORR was discussed. The role of transition metal in platinum-transition metal binary alloy was investigated. The anchor effect of transition metals to platinum on catalyst substrate, carbon, was employed to explain the improvement in catalysis compared with the catalysts consisting of platinum alone. The enhanced effect of transition metal dope in metal oxides catalysts was ascribed to the change of their electronic state and increase in adsorption sites for oxygen.

Herein, amorphous MoS2 (a-MoS2) coated Ni3S2 with three-dimensional nanosheets composite architecture supported on nickel foam (a-MoS2-Ni3S2/NF) was prepared via hydrothermal vulcanization Ni(OH)(2)/NF using thiourea and sodium molybdate dihydrate. In this process, the network structure of Ni3S2 nanosheets was primarily formed by in situ vulcanization of the Ni(OH)(2) on nickel foam (NF) and was covered by the amorphous MoS2 (a-MoS2) nanoflakes as a skeleton at the same time. Not only did the hierarchical nanosheets nanoarrays and self-supported composite architecture of a-MoS2-Ni3S2/NF prevent the accumulation of nanoflakes, increase the active surface area and expose more active sites, but also facilitated the penetration of electrolytes and the transfer of charge/mass. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between the a-MoS2 nanoflakes with highly disordered structure and Ni3S2 substrates with high conductivity significantly enhanced the HER and OER activity. The nanosheets composite structure of a-MoS2-Ni3S2/NF demonstrated an extremely low overpotential of 81 at 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and 150 mV at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER in alkaline conditions, respectively. In particular, when taken as both positive and negative electrodes to the full water electrolysis under alkaline medium, the bifunctional electrocatalyst of a-MoS2-Ni3S2/NF only required the battery voltage of 1.54 V at 100 mA cm(-2).

Based on the high-activity transition metal ions and metal alloys of ultrastable bifunctional catalyst, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are the key to achieving the energy conversion method by overall water splitting (OWS). This study reports that the Co-based coordination polymer (ZIF-67) anchoring on an indium-organic framework (InOF-1) composite (InOF-1@ZIF-67) is treated followed by carbonization and phosphorization to successfully obtain CoP nanoparticles-embedded carbon nanotubes and nitrogen-doped carbon materials (CoP-InNC@CNT). As HER and OER electrocatalysts, it is demonstrated that CoP-InNC@CNT simultaneously exhibit high HER performance (overpotential of 153 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 159 mV in 1.0 m KOH) and OER performance (overpotential of 270 mV in 1.0 m KOH) activities to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, these CoP-InNC@CNT rods, as a cathode and an anode, can display an excellent OWS performance with eta(10) = 1.58 V and better stability, which shows the satisfying electrocatalyst for the OWS compared to control materials. This method ensures the tight and uniform growth of the fast nucleating and stable materials on substrate and can be further applied for practical electrochemical reactions.									143	6	0	0	4	0	143				2198-3844		WOS:000508741100001	32154085

Herein, we highlighted a core-branch hydroxysulfide as a significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalyst. This hydroxysulfide was facilely fabricated via a versatile interfacial reaction in S2- inorganic solution at room temperature for a designed period. The moderative growth kinetics contributed to the growth of interconnected hydroxysulfide nanosheets with high-sulfur contents on the hydroxide precursor substrates, resulting in a hierarchical nanostructure with multifunctional modifications, including regulated electronic structure, rapid electron highway, excellent accessibility, and facilitated mass transfer. Such synthetic methodology can be generalized and facilely governed by regulating the temperature, concentration, duration, and solvent for targeted nanostructures. Contributed to the favorably regulated electronic structure and surface nanostructure, the as-obtained core-branch Co2NiS2.4(OH)(1.2) sample exhibits superior OER performance, with a remarkably low overpotential (279 mV required for 10.0 mA cm(-2)), a low Tafel slope (52 mV dec(-1)), and a favorable long-term stability. This work not only presents a promising nanostructured hydroxysulfide for excellent OER electrocatalysis, but also shed fresh lights on the further rational development of efficient electrocatalysts.

The oxygen carriers (OC) replace air to provide oxygen to a wide range of fuels for combustion, viareduction/oxidation cycles in a circulating fluidized bed reactor at high temperature [1]. Copper oxide supported on alumina grain (CuO/Al2O3) has been widely considered as a promising oxygen carrier (OC) for industrial use in CLC, due to its benign nature and flexible redox behaviour that ensures high reactivity and oxygen transfer capacity. However, the OC sustains successive high temperature (800-900degC) reduction (combustion) and oxidation (regeneration of oxide phase) reaction cycles which lead to chemical and morphological changes in the material causing the degradation in the oxygen-carrying properties. The evolution in the cycled material is attributed to the diffusion of the Cu-phases at the grain scale [2].Herein, we are bridging the gap in understanding between the observed mum-scale migration of Cu-based phases and nanoscale transformations of the Cu nanoparticles (NPs) by employing a multi-scale characterization approach using Scanning Transmission X-ray (STXM) and Scanning Transmission Electron (STEM) Microscopies, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1435-8115			INSPEC:21613160

Herein, bimetallic phosphides CoFeP with hollow microspheres structure has been synthesized through a facile gas phosphorization as bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. SEM and TEM demonstrate the formation of uniform hollow microspheres of CoFeP. The hollow structure of CoFeP is helpful to increase the exposed actives and the larger contact surface with electrolyte. The bimetallic composites can provide the better intrinsic activity. Compared with single metallic phosphides CoP and FeP, the obvious enhancement of electrocatalytic performances of CoFeP can be observed. The electrochemical results show that the bimetallic CoFeP hollow microspheres only have the lower overpotential of 177 and 350 mV (vs. RHE) to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively. The reasons may be due to the hollow nanostructure and the synergistic effect from bimetallic phosphides. This work provides a facile and effective way to design excellent phosphides electrocatalysts for water splitting based on gas phosphorization of bimetallic oxides precursors.									72	4	0	0	2	0	76			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000449683100094

XRD and XPS confirm the formation of Ag-Fe-Co2P. SEM and TEM demonstrate that Ag-Fe-Co2P has uniform nanospherical morphology composed of vertical nanosheets, which imply the more exposed active sites for water splitting. For HER measurements in 1 M KOH, Ag-Fe-Co2P with the overpotential of only 41 mV to drive current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Remarkably, to achieve current density of 100 mA cm(-2) for OER, Ag-Fe-Co2P requires overpotential of 220 mV, which is obviously less than that of Fe-Co2P. Furtherly, when Ag-Fe-Co2P was used as the electrocatalyst for both cathode and anodic, a cell voltage of 1.53 V was able to reach 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, outperforming most reported nonprecious electrocatalysts. The obvious enhancement in activity of Ag-Fe-Co2P for HER and OER derived from its high conductivity, electron-donating ability and augmented accessibility of active sites. Therefore, designing multiple metal doped transition metal phosphides with unique nanostructure may be a promising way for efficient overall water splitting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The three-phase interface was investigated during the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Contact angle measurements revealed a spreading interface during the HER whereas the droplet shape remained unchanged during the HOR for both droplets. The overhead view revealed the formation of many fine droplets near the meniscus boundary during the HOR in the alkaline electrolyte, which agrees with previous results for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The correlation of these observations with electrochemical data and differences in the results between the HOR and the HER suggest that the motion of the meniscus was induced by local pH and temperature gradients, presumably caused by a non-uniform reaction because of the limitations of the dissolved gas.

Herein, a zinc-mediated synthesis strategy is proposed for N-doped graphitic porous carbon encapsulated uniform dispersed Fe3C nanoparticles coupled with atomically dispersed Fe-N-x moieties (NPC/Fe-N-C) derived from biomass coconut shell. The introduction of zinc species could be conductive to the dispersion of iron species and formation of porous structures. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the N-doped carbon coating structures can weaken the oxygen intermediates adsorption energy barrier of Fe3C. Beside, the graphitic carbon could promote the electron transfer during the electrochemical reaction. These special structures enable NPC/Fe-N-C to have excellent ORR activity with an Eonset of 1.0 V, which is much better than Pt/C. Furthermore, the zinc-air battery assembled by pairing NPC/Fe-N-C with a high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst can continuously and stably operate a charge-discharge potential gap of 0.8 V at 10 mA/cm(2) for more than 600 h. More importantly, the assembled batteries could drive overall water splitting device, realizing the effective energy conversion.

Here, an ingenious one-step reaction strategy is presented to fabricate layered double hydroxide (LDH) microcapsules, which benefit from the oxyphilic and synergistic coordination of Ce species to stabilize the initial morphology of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Taking advantage of this unique superstructure, the as-prepared Ni-Fe-Ce-LDH microcapsules demonstrate excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity with an overpotential of 242 mV at 10 mA cm(-2)and long-term durability of at least 24 h. Density functional theory (DFT) results further confirm the electronic modulation induced by the Ce doping for both subtle 3D LDH architectures and superior OER performances. This work not only provides insight into the rare-earth (RE) doping mediated crystal growth and transformation process of MOFs but also represents a facile way to fabricate the desired microcapsule superstructure by virtue of the Lewis acid property and synergistic coordination of RE-ions.									64	0	1	0	3	0	65			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000570224500015

However, the thickness of the commonly reported 2D LDHs is in nanoscale and the bottom-up synthesis of atomically thin LDHs is rarely reported. Herein, high-quality atomically thin layered NiFe-LDHs assembled 3D microspheres were synthesized via a rational designed reaction system, where the formation of atomically thin building blocks was controlled by the synergetic effects of released carbonate anions and butanol. Furthermore, the complexant and solvents played important effects on the process of coprecipitation and the assembling of LDHs. Due to the nature of atomically thin LDHs nanosheets and unique 3D hierarchical structures, the obtained microspheres exhibited excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline medium with an onset overpotential (0.435 V, which is lower than that of common LDHs) and good durability.

However, phase-controlled synthesis of colloidal Ni2P nanocrystals (NCs) or related heterostructures remains challenging and their use as bifunctional electrocatalysts in overall water splitting (OWS) is not systematically studied. Herein, zero-dimensional (0D) colloidal Ni2P NCs are synthesized using a robust solution-phase method and encapsulated in two-dimensional (2D) N- and S-doped graphene (NSG) nanosheets via facile ex situ sonication to form a 0D@2D Ni2P@NSG heterostructure. The interaction between surface functionalities of Ni2P NCs and defective NSG via strong van der Waals force provides a robust sheath to Ni2P NCs when encapsulated in NSG nanosheets, further enhancing the specific surface area and active site exposure. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the dual interaction of N and S dopants with Ni2P benefits the synergistic effect of optimized water and hydrogen free energy adsorption. As a result, Ni2P@NSG electrocatalysts manifest high catalytic activity toward HER and OER, and a two-electrode alkaline electrolyzer assembled by Ni2P@NSG as both an anode and a cathode requires only 1.572 V to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2).									35	3	0	0	0	0	36			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000610984700022

During catalyzation, reaction-driven transformation of Ni/NiO hybrid structures into Ni single atoms and clusters was observed on deformed NCNTs. These single atoms (clusters) remained anchored even after harsh washing in acid, manifesting that NiO/Ni@NCNTs may be used as a platform for stabilised site-isolated catalysis in practical electrolytic processes. Surface characterization shows that metallic Ni was shown to mainly originate from Ni atoms bonded to pyridinic N atoms of the carbon skeleton. As shown by theoretical calculations, the Gibbs free energy Delta G (H*) of the H adsorption was minimised when a Ni atom was adjacent to an O atom on a Ni (111) surface, which indicated that metallic Ni partially covered with NiO was energetically favourable for the HER.

Herein, a facile two-step solution method to rational design of a novel electrode of hollow NiCo2O4 nanowall arrays on flexible carbon cloth substrate is reported. Uniform 2D cobalt-based wall-like MOFs are first synthesized via a solution reaction, and then the 2D solid nanowall arrays are converted into hollow and porous NiCo2O4 nanostructures through an ion-exchange and etching process with an additional annealing treatment. The as-obtained NiCo2O4 nanostructure arrays can provide rich reaction sites and short ion diffusion path. When evaluated as a flexible electrode material for supercapacitor, the as-fabricated NiCo2O4 nanowall electrode shows remarkable electrochemical performance with excellent rate capability and long cycle life. In addition, the hollow NiCo2O4 nanowall electrode exhibits promising electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction. This work provides an example of rational design of hollow nanostructured metal oxide arrays with high electrochemical performance and mechanical flexibility, holding great potential for future flexible multifunctional electronic devices.									686	39	0	0	38	0	694			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000403913400012

However, this operation is always accompanied by the oxygen evolution from the cathode oxides, which might cause the crystal destruction of the cathode oxides and the severe electrolyte decomposition on the cathodes, leading to the fast failure of the batteries. In this work, we report a new finding that the oxygen evolution in graphite/LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 pouch cell can be efficiently suppressed and thus the cyclic stability of the cell is significantly improved by using tributyl borate (TBB) as electrolyte additive, even under 4.5 V. Electrochemical tests indicate that, with adding 1 wt% TBB to the electrolyte, the capacity retention of the cell is enhanced from in 35.1% to 94.9% after 120 cycles. The physical characterizations combining theoretical calculations demonstrate that the B-containing species in the cathode electrolyte interphase, originated from the oxidation of TBB, present a strong combination with oxygen and suppress efficiently the oxygen evolution.

The formation of Ti3+ and OVs contributed to the reduced bandgap of TNAs and improved the efficiency of methylene blue (MB) photocatalytic degradation and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, the black TNAs synthesized by the anodization method. The current density for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of the black TNAs was over - 2mA/cm(2) at just - 1.4V vs. Ag/AgCl and the photocurrent density of the black TNAs is about 25% higher than that of the pristine TNAs. In addition, MB photocatalytic degradation of the black TNAs reached nearly 60% after 150 min under visible light. This study inspired the next studies in the use of materials to both treat polluted water and generate renewable energy.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			2510-1560	2510-1579		WOS:000488973200001

Herein, heterostructured Co3Mo nanoparti-cles/porous CoMoO3 nanosheets (Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs) were constructed for alkaline water splitting by annealing CoMoOx nanosheets under controlled atmospheres. Thanks to its interfacial electronic structure and increased electrochemical active area, Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs exhibit impressive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with an overpotential of 334 mV at 10 0 0 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 46.4 mV per decade in 1.0 M KOH, which outperforms Pt/C catalyst (621 mV and 74.7 mV per decade). Density functional theory calculations illustrate the electron transfer from Co3Mo to CoMoO3 at the interfaces, where electron accumulation on CoMoO3 favors the dissociation of H2O molecule, and electron-deficient Co atoms in Co3Mo have optimized H * absorption energy for HER. The Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs also exhibit higher oxygen evolution reaction activity than the RuO2 catalyst. Moreover, the water electrolyzer us-ing Co3Mo/CoMoO3 NPSs as both cathode and anode only requires 1.59 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which outperforms benchmark Pt/C || RuO2 electrodes couple with 1.69 V to reach the same current density, providing great potential for large-scale applications.(C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The editorial office of Journal of Materials Science & Technology.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1005-0302	1941-1162		WOS:000861827800005

To improve their catalytic kinetics and mass activity are essential for sustainable industrial applications. Here, we report a rare-earth metal-based oxide electrocatalyst comprised of ultrathin amorphous La2O3 nanosheets hybridized with uniform La2O3 nanoparticles (La2O3@NP-NS). Significantly improved OER performance is observed from the nanosheets with a nanometer-scale thickness. The as-synthesized 2.27-nm La2O3@NP-NS exhibits excellent catalytic kinetics with an overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 43.1 mV dec(-1), and electrochemical impedance of 38 ohm. More importantly, due to the ultrasmall thickness, its mass activity, and turnover frequency reach as high as 6666.7 A g(-1) and 5.79 s(-1), respectively, at an overpotential of 310 mV. Such a high mass activity is more than three orders of magnitude higher than benchmark OER electrocatalysts, such as IrO2 and RuO2. This work presents a sustainable approach toward the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts with largely reduced mass loading of precious elements.									29	1	0	0	1	0	30			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000515623000001	34138270

Herein, a unique line-sphere layered superstructure Ag/CoO is prepared via a facile alternating electrodeposition method. Compared to electrocatalysts with CoO as the innermost layer, the Ag/CoO catalysts with Ag nanowires (NWs) as initial layer take more advantages of the low conductance for water splitting. Electrochemical tests reveal that the layered superstructure material with n+1 layers of Ag NWs and n layers of CoO (An+Cn) exhibits excellent catalytic activities and stabilities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In addition, when the catalyst consisting of 3 layers of Ag NWs and 2 layers of CoO (A3C2) used as a dual-function electrode, only a potential of 1.90 V is needed for current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Based on the kinetics and thermodynamic measurements of the catalytic processes, a reasonable catalytic mechanism of overall water splitting has been proposed for different electrocatalysts. The results show that the diffusion of hydrogen-containing species may be the rate-determining step. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These temperature dependent phase transitions significantly impact the ordering of oxygen vacancies and electrochemical kinetic properties as well as the reliability of the related devices. Some of the crystal structures formed, e.g. hexagonal phases, turn out to be almost impermeable to oxygen gas. Therefore, it is important to stabilize the crystal structure of SrCoO3-delta that favors the ORR over a wide temperature range. Herein, the partial substitution of the A-site Sr with Yb is systematically studied, including synthesis, characterization and analysis of structural evolution, electrochemical kinetic properties, thermal stability, and stability in a CO2-containing atmosphere. The results indicate that Sr0.90Yb0.10CoO3-delta is able to stabilize the tetragonal crystal structure with less ordered oxygen vacancies, leading to polarization resistances of 0.051, 0.115 and 0.272 Omega cm(2) at 750, 700 and 650 degrees C, respectively, on symmetrical cells. Sr0.90Yb0.10CoO3-delta demonstrates a very stable surface oxygen vacancy distribution and electronic structure near oxygen vacancies but dissociation of adsorbed oxygen molecules into atomic oxygen is affected by surface Sr segregation, and polarization resistance degradation is mainly induced by surface Sr segregation. Furthermore, Sr0.90Yb0.10CoO3-delta exhibits excellent thermal stability as well as excellent recovery stability and improved polarization performance after a few pure air/CO2-containing air treatment cycles at 700 degrees C. However, a hysteresis behavior of polarization performance is observed at 650 degrees C during gas cycling treatment, which may cause long-term degradation of the Sr0.90Yb0.10CoO3-delta electrode. The different polarization behaviors during gas cycling treatment are induced by different sensitivities of the formed surface strontium carbonate and chemisorbed surface oxo-carbonaceous species to different operating temperatures.									6	0	0	0	1	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000539350100037

In this study, three-dimensional (3D) curved nanosheets of Mo-doped Ni3S2 grown on nickel foam were successfully synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal process. The hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environment of this 3D catalyst are investigated in detail. The results show that it possesses lower overpotential, high current densities and small Tafel slopes both in OER and HER. For HER, the catalysts show excellent electrochemical performance, demonstrating a low over-potential of 212 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a large decrease of 127 mV compared to the undoped Ni3S2. And it also shows a lower over potential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) which decreases 30 mV for OER. In addition, it is only need 1.67 V for the overall water splitting at 10 mA cm(-2) which is 70 mV. It found that the Mo element would change the morphology of Ni3S2 and induce much more active sites for HER and OER. The as-prepared Mo-doped Ni3S2 bi-functional electrocatalyst could act as the promising electrode materials for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study we present sodium metavanadate as a solution additive, inducing selective cathodic formation of hydrogen in the presence of various other reducible species such as hypochlorite, chlorate, oxygen, nitrate, hydrogen-peroxide and ferricyanide. During electrolysis a vanadium-oxide coating forms from the reduction of sodium metavanadate, explaining the observed enhanced selectivity. The hydrogen evolution reaction proceeds without significantly altered kinetics on such in situ modified electrode surfaces. This suggests that the reaction takes place at the interface between the electrode surface and the protective film, which acts as a diffusion barrier preventing the unwanted species to reach the electrode surface.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000457952600024

The introduction of Fe into layered nickel hydroxide has been effective strategy to enhance performance of OER as well as HMFOR. However, considering that HMFOR and OER are competitive with each other, it is hardly understandable how Fe simultaneously enhances both reactions. Herein, we provide an insight toward the role of Fe in the layered Ni(OH)(2) in both oxidation reactions. While the OER activity of the layered Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has volcanic relation with Fe content, the HMFOR activity was highest in the Fe-free Ni(OH)(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1566-7367	1873-3905		WOS:000852046000005

Surface reactions including water splitting and hydrogen oxidation reactions play important roles in the hydrogen separation process. Catalysts with high catalytic activities towards these two reactions are highly desired. In this work, in-situ exsolved Ru and Ni nanocatalysts were prepared and tested for hydrogen separation in four membrane reactors. The Ru element incorporates into the lattice of Ce0.85Sm0.15O1.925 (SDC) support after being prepared in air but it is exsolved from the SDC lattice to form 3-5 nm nanoparticles after being reduced in hydrogen. The Ru nanoparticles prefer to stay at the step-faceting of the support. Meanwhile, the strong metal-support interactions (SMSI) between Ru and SDC support has been certified. The SMSI benefits the stabilization of Ru nanoparticles at elevated temperatures, thus the Ru/SDC catalyst shows high catalytic activity towards both hydrogen oxidation and water splitting reactions. A doubled hydrogen separation rate of 21.6 mL cm(-2) min(-1) was obtained at 900 degrees C when using the Ru/SDC catalyst compared with Ni-based catalysts. Experimental results show that the catalysts on both sides have great impacts on the hydrogen separation rate, indicating both the water splitting reaction and hydrogen oxidation reaction are potential rate determining steps.									15	3	0	0	1	0	16			0376-7388	1873-3123		WOS:000513180500002

The hollow spheres with controlling Co/Ni ratios were obtained via a hydrothermal process and following phosphorization reaction using Ni-Co based glycerate microsphere as a self-sacrificing template. The hollow shell with vertical branches was formed via a morphology evolution of solid, yolk-shell to hollow. The hollow spheres were encapsulated in PrGO networks by a hydrothermal synthesis and phosphorization process to fabricate PrGO/Ni-Co phosphide composite (PrGO/NiCoP). Because of unique morphology and composition, the composite with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 1:1 exhibits enhanced supercapacitor and electrocatalysis properties. As a supercapacitor electrode, PrGO/NiCoP provides high discharge specific capacity, excellent rate performance and cycle stability. An asymmetric supercapacitor assembled with PrGO/NiCoP and activated carbon possesses an energy density of 49.7 Wh/Kg with power density of 0.366 kW/kg, which can successfully illuminate red-light light emitting diode. As an electrocatalyst, PrGO/NiCoP exhibits high hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction activities in 1M KOH electrolyte. PrGO/NiCoP electrolyzer shows excellent overall water splitting performance and durability, which required a cell voltage of 1.56 V to achieve a current density of 10 mAcm(-2). (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, Xiao; Chen, Tao; Liu, Li; Fu, Wensheng								Multipronged Fabrication of Co3Se4 Wrapped into N-Doped Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes Tangled Hollow Dodecahedron Framework for Overall Water Splitting under Benign Condition								ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES				8	17					2100879	10.1002/admi.202100879		AUG 2021		SEP 2021	2021	In this work, a synergistic strategy is proposed to synthesize a high-performance bifunctional electrocatalyst (marked as Co3Se4/N-CNTs) for neutral water splitting, in which Co3Se4 nanoparticles are wrapped into N-doped multiwall carbon nanotubes assembled hollow dodecahedron framework. The neutral-oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performances of Co3Se4/N-CNTs are maximally optimized by regulating nanostructure engineering, element doping, and carbon coating. In 1 m phosphate buffer solution (PBS) electrolyte, Co3Se4/N-CNTs catalyst exhibits superior stability and catalytic activity for OER and HER, yielding a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 and -10 mA cm(-2) at rather low overpotentials of 385 and 102 mV, respectively, meanwhile operating continuously for 35 h without obvious polarization increase. It is worth mentioning here, when a neutral electrolyzer is assembled, Co3Se4/N-CNTs parallel to Co3Se4/N-CNTs cell contributes a high performance for overall water splitting in 1 m PBS electrolyte, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low applied external potential of 1.75 V, and displaying satisfying operation stability without evident deactivation after 35 h. The catalytic performances rival those of catalysts operated under moderate conditions. Consequently, all the merits promise that Co3Se4/N-CNTs is an attractive bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen fuel production and storage of intermittent renewable energy sources under environmentally friendly conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000685666400001

In this work, self-supported Mo-doped Ni3S2 (denoted as Mo-Ni3S2/NF) was successfully assembled via a facile one-step hydrothermal method and used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst. A series of controllable morphologies were achieved by changing the molar ratios of reactants to study the influencing factors of electrocatalytic activity. The as-obtained Mo-doped Ni3S2/NF nanoneedles exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities with a low overpotential of 170 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for the HER and an excellent overpotential of 174 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for the OER. When used as both a cathode and an anode for overall water splitting in two electrode configuration (1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte), Mo-Ni3S2/NF nanoneedles exhibit outstanding activity (an external voltage of 1.49 V to display a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) and impressive durability (no obvious degradation at a constant voltage for up to 24 h). This work provides a promising avenue of incorporating the nanostructure design with compositional modulation to synthesize bifunctional electrocatalysts of superior activity and delicate stability.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000537294300043

These distinctive features have rendered them remarkable advantages over their bulk counterparts for surface-related applications, for example, electrochemical water splitting. In this review article, we highlight the recent research progress in low-dimensional metallic nanostructures for electrochemical water splitting including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fundamental understanding of the electrochemistry of water splitting including HER and OER is firstly provided from the aspects of catalytic mechanisms, activity descriptors and property evaluation metrics. Generally, it is challenging to obtain low-dimensional metallic nanostructures with desirable characteristics for HER and OER. We hereby introduce several typical methods for synthesizing one-dimensional and two-dimensional metallic nanostructures including organic ligand-assisted synthesis, hydrothermal/solvothermal synthesis, carbon monoxide confined growth, topotactic reduction, and templated growth. We then put emphasis on the strategies adopted for the design and fabrication of high-performance low-dimensional metallic nanostructures for electrochemical water splitting such as alloying, structure design, surface engineering, interface engineering and strain engineering. The underlying structure-property correlation for each strategy is elucidated aiming to facilitate the design of more advanced electrocatalysts for water splitting. The challenges and perspectives for the development of electrochemical water splitting and low-dimensional metallic nanostructures are also proposed.									272	17	0	0	13	0	276			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000537849300004	32309830

The BiVO4 photocatalyst was obtained by the reaction of Bi(NO3)(3)center dot 5H(2)O and NH4VO3 at a low temperature (60 degrees C). Both the morphology and the crystal phase of the synthesized product can be tuned by changing the concentrations of the precursor. The O-2 evolution activity of BiVO4 nano-leaves from photocatalytic water splitting under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) is significantly higher than that of the BiVO4 sample synthesized by a traditional solid state reaction method, and the activity can be further improved by annealing the samples.									52	8	0	0	5	0	57			1466-8033			WOS:000288562200050

Achieving such design requires an integrated strategy in which porosity, conductivity, catalytic activity, and mechanical durability are all considered in a battery system. Here, we develop polypyrrole-coated carbon x-aerogels with macroscopic 3D architecture, and demonstrate their potential as oxygen cathodes for Li-O-2 batteries. This material, a novel and mechanically strong composite aerogel with polymer-cross-linked structure, not only provides effective pores that allow to store the discharge products and open channels for better oxygen diffusion, but also forms a robust 3D catalytic network that promotes both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions with improved mechanical and electrochemical stability. This work highlights the synergy between the 3D porous, conductive carbon aerogel framework and the polypyrrole catalytic layer, which maintains stable catalytic activity without deactivation and provides a more effective gas-liquid-solid interface for rapid oxygen absorption and diffusion, thereby leading to significant improvements in the capacity, rate capability and cycle life of the cathode.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000426148500021	29411816

Tremendous efforts have been made on developing highly active and durable catalysts to lower the overpotentials for ORR and OER. In addition to the intrinsic activity and stability of the catalysts, construction of the air electrodes plays an important role in the overall performance of the air electrodes. Accordingly, three kinds of electrode configurations are herein compared: single, combined, and decoupled bifunctional air electrodes. The decoupled design of the air electrodes shows the best performance in terms of both the discharge and charge performance compared to the other configurations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The study showed that the partial substitution of La by Sr in the LaCoO3 matrix increased the electrochemically effective area (R-F), as well as the apparent electrocatalytic activity (i(a)) but it decreased the true catalytic efficiency (i(t)). Small substitutions at the B site by Ni seemed to slightly improve the electrochemically active area. On the contrary, all other substitutions, namely, Cr, Mn, Fe and Cu had the adverse effect. It is noteworthy that 0.1 mot Fe substitution considerably improved both the apparent as well as the true catalytic activity of the oxide, while other substitutions except Cu, had detrimental effect on the electrocatalysis of O-2 evolution. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) followed first-order kinetics with respect to OH- ion concentration. The Tafel slope (b) values at low potentials ranged between 60 and 80 mV decade(-1) and that they increased slightly with increasing temperature. The electrochemical apparent activation energy (DeltaH(el)(#)) of OE was observed to decrease on increasing the potential across the, catalyst/1 M KOH interface. The DeltaS(#) values for the reaction were largely negative. Based on these results a suitable mechanism for O-2 evolution is proposed. (C) 2001 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

These positively charged layers are neutralized by exchangeable anions in the interlayer galleries. LDH-based materials have substantial potential in efficient energy (e.g., H-2, O-2) generation. Over the last few decades, tremendous progress has been made toward developing LDH-based materials for H-2 and O-2 evolution, for which the performance of LDH-based materials is closely related to the synthesis method. This minireview initially outlines the recent advances in the synthesis of LDH-based materials. The advantages and challenges of the protocols in tuning the properties of the material are also discussed and highlighted. The application section concentrates on the most recent progress in photocatalytic H-2 generation and photocatalytic and electrocatalytic O-2 evolution. By taking advantage of the flexible tunability and uniform distribution of metal cations in the brucite-like layers or the intercalated anions in the interlayer space, LDH-based materials exhibit attractive properties in the generation of H-2 and O-2 with advantages such as improved light absorption, enhanced charge separation, better electron transfer, promoted electrode reaction kinetics, and high durability.									67	6	0	0	7	0	68			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000373110300001

Porous ternary Pt-based branched nanostructures (PTB-Pt) with unique catalytic properties, low-density structural stability, multiple electronic effects, high surface area, and maximized atomic utilization can maximize the ORR catalytic activity at low Pt content.

Herein, an efficient liquid exfoliation strategy was designed for producing silk-like FeS2/NiS2 hybrid nanocrystals with enhanced reversible oxygen catalytic performance that displayed excellent properties for Zn-air batteries. Because of the unique silk-like morphology and interface nanocrystal structure, they can catalyze the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiently with a low overpotential of 233 mV at j = 10 mA cm(-2). This is an improvement from the recently reported catalysts in 1.0 M KOH. Meanwhile, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the silk-like FeS2/NiS2 hybrid nanocrystals showed an onset potential of 911 mV and a half-wave potential of 640 mV. In addition, the reversible oxygen electrode activity of the silk-like FeS2/NiS2 hybrid nanocrystals was calculated to be 0.823 V, based on the potential of the OER and ORR. Further, the homemade rechargeable Zn-air batteries using FeS2/NiS2 hybrid nanocrystals as the air-cathode displayed a high open-circuit voltage of 1.25 V for more than 17 h and an excellent rechargeable performance for 25 h. The solid Zn-air batteries exhibited an excellent rechargeable performance for 15 h. This study provided a new method for designing interface nanocrystals with a unique morphology for efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts in electrochemical reactions and renewable energy devices.
