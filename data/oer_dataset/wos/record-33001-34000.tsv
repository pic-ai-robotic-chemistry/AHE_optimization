This has attracted a great interest in designing laccases a la carte with enhanced stabilities or activities tailored to specific conditions for different fields of application. Over 20 years, numerous efforts have been taken to engineer these multicopper oxidases and to understand their reaction mechanisms by site-directed mutagenesis, and more recently, using computational calculations and directed evolution tools. In this work, we review the most relevant contributions made in the field of laccase engineering, from the comprehensive study of their structure-function relationships to the tailoring of outstanding biocatalysts.									65	3	0	0	44	0	68			1420-682X	1420-9071		WOS:000349598300005	25586560

As a model system, the interactions of birnessite, which is a common manganese oxide in the environment, and bovine serum albumin, as a protein that has a strong affinity for a variety of inorganic molecules, are studied. The author proposes that the cofactor-formation in particular enzymes may be considered as a biomineralization in the presence of the protein. One of the numerous and very small nanoparticles produced in the presence of protein could be formed in an appropriate location in proteins and be used as a primitive inorganic core (cofactor) of enzyme.									11	0	0	0	2	0	11			1431-7613	1611-7530		WOS:000310975800006	22872505

The resulting material is mostly comprised of face centered cubic FeNi3 alloy forming a highly porous coating with nanostructured features. The addition of Mo (up to approximate to 14 at%) generates no new crystal phases but only an increase in the lattice parameter, indicating the formation of FeNi3Mox solid solutions. The FeNi3Mox solid solutions are used as electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. The addition of Mo increases the HER activity significantly reaching an optimum performance at approximate to 9 at% Mo (FeNi3Mo0.40) with an overpotential at -10 mA cm(-2) of 112 mV and a Tafel slope of 109 mV dec(-1). The enhanced HER activity is attributed to the formation of a FeNi3Mox solid solution with an increased work function that is correlated to smaller hydrogen adsorption energies. Theoretical activity maps reveal that sites near superficial Mo atoms forms catalytic hot spots and are responsible for the observed activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-7350			WOS:000864415500001

The porous structure is beneficial for exposing more active sites and the mass transfer during the HER. In addition, the carbon matrixes with the highly doped N and P heteroatoms also provide their positive contributions to its high catalytic activity for HER. Owing to the advantages mentioned above, the optimized catalyst shows a small overpotential of 181mV for driving a cathodic current density of 10mAcm(-2), a low Tafel slope of 65.3mVdec(-1) and a high exchange current density of 1.5x10(-2)mAcm(-2) during HER processes in acid electrolyte.

The dominant dipeptides formed are Gly-Gly, Gly-Ala and Gly-Val, at longer reaction times sequence inversion produces Ala-Gly and, considerably slower, Val-Gly. Ala-Ala is also produced and the relative amounts of the diastereomers prove the high conservation of optical purity of the original amino acids over a considerable time. The results lead to some further conclusions about the reaction mechanism and the possible dominance of peptide sequences in primordial dipeptides.									37	0	0	0	20	0	37			0169-6149			WOS:A1992KC35200002	1465297

The Urea-PDI presents a wide spectrum response owing to its large conjugated system. The Urea-PDI performs so far highest oxygen evolution rate (3223.9 mu mol g(-1)h(-1)) without cocatalysts under visible light. The performance is over 107.5 times higher than that of the conventional PDI supramolecular photocatalysts. The strong oxidizing ability comes from the deep valence band (+1.52 eV) which is contributed by the covalent-bonded conjugated molecules. Besides, the high crystallinity and the large molecular dipoles of the Urea-PDI contribute to a robust built-in electric field promoting the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, the Urea-PDI is very stable and has no performance attenuation after 100 h continuous irradiation. The Urea-PDI polymer photocatalyst provides with a new platform for the use of photocatalytic water oxidation, which is expected to contribute to clean energy production.									94	6	0	0	11	0	92			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000543734200001	32596838

In this work, we for the first time synthesize carbon supported CoP nanoparticles with the average particle sizes from 3.3 to 9.2 nm, via a solvothermal process followed by low-temperature topological phosphorization, and the size-dependent HER activity of the CoP is investigated by virtue of TEM, XRD, XPS and the electrochemical techniques. It is discovered that the 9.2nm-CoP particles possess high intrinsic HER catalytic activity as compared to the 3.3nm-CoP, although the smaller one displays a high mass activity due to the large surface area. Detailed studies manifest that the small CoP particles suffer from serious oxidation once exposing to air. In contrast, most cobalt remains in the quasi-metallic state in the relatively large CoP particles, which is beneficial for the desorption of H-ads, the rate determining step of the HER process over CoP surface. In addition, the low charge transfer resistance across the liquid/solid interfaces also contributes to the excellent HER activity of the relatively large CoP particles.

Herein, we have demonstrated a simple and inexpensive synthesis strategy to design three-dimensional (3D) iron tungsten oxide nanoflower-anchored nitrogen-doped graphene (3D Fe-WO3 NF/NG) hybrid for a highly efficient synergistic catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The construction of flowerlike Fe-WO3 nanostructures, based on synthesis parameters, and their ORR performances are systematically investigated. Although pristine 3D Fe-WO3 NF or reduced graphene oxides show poor catalytic performance and even their hybrid shows unsatisfactory results, impressively, the excellent ORR activity and its outstanding durability are further improved by N doping, especially due to pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen moieties into a graphene sheet. Remarkably, 3D Fe-WO3 NF/NG hybrid nanoarchitecture reveals an outstanding electrocatalytic performance with a remarkable onset potential value (similar to 0.98 V), a half-wave potential (similar to 0.85 V) versus relative hydrogen electrode, significant methanol tolerance, and extraordinary durability of similar to 95% current retention, even after 15 000 potential cycles, which is superior to a commercial Pt/C. The exclusive porous architecture, excellent electrical conductivity, and the high synergistic interaction between 3D Fe-WO3 NF and NG sheets are the beneficial phenomena for such admirable catalytic performance. Therefore, this finding endows design of a highly efficient and durable nonprecious metal-based electrocatalyst for high-performance ORR in alkaline media.									28	0	0	0	1	0	29			1944-8244			WOS:000446142100043	30175582	
J	Kundu, Avinava; Kumar, Brajesh; Chakraborty, Biswarup								Greigite Fe3S4-Derived alpha-FeO(OH) Promotes Slow O-O Bond Formation in the Second-Order Oxygen Evolution Reaction Kinetics								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				126	38			16172	16186		10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c05196				SEP 29 2022	2022	The mechanistic pathway of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) invariably changes with the surface structure of the catalyst and difficult to envisage. Concerning the mechanistic interpretation of the rate-limiting step, the order of the reaction, and other intrinsic parameters, electrokinetic study is thereby of particular interest. Greigite Fe3S4 nanosheets prepared herein via a solvothermal route while deposited on the nickel foam (NF) electrode surface act as an acceptable OER catalyst with a recorded overpotential of 251 (+/- 6) mV at a j value of 10 mA cm-2 comparable to some benchmark iron/nickel oxy-hydroxide catalysts. Ex situ post-OER analysis of a Fe3S4/NF anode has affirmed the formation of alpha-FeO(OH) as the active species for the alkaline OER. The OER performance however can be improved upon elevating the cell temperature from 303 to 338 K. Electrokinetic data obtained at variable temperatures provide several important intrinsic parameters. The experimen-tally determined transfer coefficient alpha (1.90), exchange current density js ' (3.06 x 10-6 mA cm-2), and a Tafel slope of 45.9 mV dec-1 implicate the O-O bond formation as the rate-limiting step following a Rossmeisl's peroxide path (RPP) where a nucleophilic attack of OH- to the Fe(IV)=O results in the formation of iron(III) hydroperoxo (Fe(III)-OOH) in the slowest step. From the variable temperature OER kinetics, the calculated activation energy (Ea) 53 (+/- 2.1) kJ mol-1 is comparable to the noble metal oxide (IrO2) but lower than other active transition metal (Co, Ni) oxide/-oxyhydroxide. Calculated Ea and other kinetic data further evidence that the fair OER performance is due to a low activation barrier for the O-O bond formation step on the electro-generated FeO(OH) materials. The bimolecular RPP mechanism, nucleophilic attack of OH- to the Fe(IV)=O, has further been validated by the experimentally derived second-order rate of reaction with respect to [OH-]. Moreover, the observed linear drop of the Tafel slope with increasing size of the electrolyte's cation (Li+, Na+, K+), inferred a change in the mechanism, albeit it provides evidence on the weak non-covalent interaction of the surface adsorbed -OH with the cation of the electrolyte. The detailed electrokinetic study presented herein with the electrogenerated alpha-FeO(OH) can provide some useful guidelines to establish further the accurate OER mechanism on iron oxide/oxy-hydroxide materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000864685400001

CYPs perform multiple roles through a critical irreversible enzymatic reaction in which an oxygen atom is inserted within hydrophobic molecules, converting them into the reactive and hydro soluble components. During evolution, plants have acquired significantly more number of CYPs and represent about 1% of the encoded genes . CYPs are highly conserved proteins involved in growth, development and tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses. Furthermore, CYPs reinforce plants' molecular and chemical defense mechanisms by regulating the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and controlling biosynthesis and homeostasis of phytohormones, including abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonates. Thus, they are the critical targets of metabolic engineering for enhancing plant defense against environmental stresses. Additionally, CYPs are also used as biocatalysts in the fields of pharmacology and phytoremediation. Herein, we highlight the role of CYPs in plant stress tolerance and their applications for human welfare.									3	0	0	0	2	0	3			0141-8130	1879-0003		WOS:000682782900004	34175340

However, the HER performance of state-of-the-art Pt in non-acidic solutions is unsatisfactory due to the severely sluggish kinetics. Here, DFT theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru/RuO2 composites enable high HER activity to be pursued under non-acidic conditions because of the distinctive Ru and RuO2 interface, which possess not only a strong capability to adsorb and dissociate water but also appropriate binding energies of H and OH. Therefore, we employ a simple strategy, including heating under an oxygen-poor environment and/or in situ electrochemical reduction, to partially reduce RuO2. The formed Ru/RuO2 interfaces demonstrate superior HER activities (e.g. eta(10) = 17 mV, 35 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH) than Pt/C (e.g. eta(10) = 27 mV, 58 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH) at both small (10-100 mA cm(-2)) and large (1 A cm(-2)) current densities in alkaline solution and even real seawater. Comprehensive experiments were conducted to investigate the structure-HER performance relationships. Moreover, benefiting from the bifunctional character of RuO2, a two-electrode system based on Ru/RuO2 composites and RuO2 exhibits the lowest cell voltage for water splitting in both 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. A 300 h-stability test at 10 mA cm(-2) without an obvious decay demonstrates the industrial prospects of the Ru/RuO2 composites to generate green energy.									25	2	0	0	2	0	26			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000691767100001

Herein, an adsorption-complexation-calcination strategy based on channel confining effect is explored to obtain CoN-CoOx hybrid nanoparticles uniformly dispersed in mesoporous carbon. The CoN-CoOx/C composite exhibits excellent electrocatalytic behavior for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The half-wave potential and durability are comparable or superior to those of Pt/C. When applying as cathode catalyst for a primary zinc-air battery, the open-circuit voltage and peak power density reach up to 1.394 V and 109.8 mW center dot cm(-2), respectively. A high gravimetric energy density of 950.3 Wh center dot kg(Zn)(-1) is delivered at 10 mA center dot cm(-2) with good rate capability and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrates the favorable ORR intermediate adsorbability and metallic characteristics of CoN grains with oxide hybridization to optimize the electronic structure. This work provides a facile adjustable approach for obtaining highly dispersed nanoparticles with controllable hybrid composition on a substrate, which is important for future design and optimization of high-performance electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000712941900002

In this work, a class of core-shell electrocatalysts that utilize nickel nanoparticles in the core and nitrogen-doped porous carbon architecture in the shell (Ni@NC) for the efficient electroreduction of NO to ammonia (NH3) is reported. In Ni@NC, the NC prevents the dissolution of Ni nanoparticles and ensures the long-term stability of the catalyst. The Ni nanoparticles involve in the catalytic reduction of NO to NH3 during electrolysis. As a result, the Ni@NC achieves a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 72.3% at 0.16 V-RHE. The full-cell electrolyzer is constructed by coupling Ni@NC as cathode for NORR and RuO2 as an anode for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which delivers a stable performance over 20 cycles at 1.5 V. While integrating this setup with a PV-electrolyzer cell, and it demonstrates an appreciable FE of >50%. Thus, the results exemplify that the core-shell catalyst based electrolyzer is a promising approach for the stable NO to NH3 electroconversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2198-3844		WOS:000841553000001	35981872

Ammonia-assisted carbonization was used to dope the surface with nitrogen heteroatoms in a way that replaced carbon atoms but kept the oxygen content constant. Ammonia treatment expanded the micropore size-distributions and increased the specific surface area from 383 m2?g-1 to 679 m2?g-1. The nitrogen-containing porous carbon material showed a higher capacitance (246 F?g-1) in comparison with the nitrogen-free one (186 F?g-1). Ex situ electrochemical spectroscopy was used to investigate the evolution of the nitrogen-containing functional groups on the surface of the N-doped carbon electrodes in a three-electrode cell. In addition, first-principles calculations were explored regarding the electronic structures of different nitrogen groups to determine their relative redox potentials. We proposed possible redox reaction pathways based on the calculated redox affinity of different groups and surface analysis, which involved the reversible attachment/detachment of hydroxy groups between pyridone and pyridine. The oxidation of nitrogen atoms in pyridine was also suggested as a possible reaction pathway.									330	14	0	0	16	0	336			0947-6539			WOS:000302868100029	22419436

Substituting H-2 gas as a primary source for our daily energy consumption under the guideline of the hydrogen economy concept has not progressed as anticipated because of inadequate efficiency associated with the generation (electrolyzer) and utilization (fuel cell) devices. A critical challenge is to design strategies for fabricating electrocatalysts derived from earth-rich elements to address cost and performance concerns. In this context, nanostructured transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have emerged as highly efficient electrocatalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of TMPs is ascribed to their suitable charge transfer from metal to phosphorous as well as the easy transfer process of a proton-coupled electron during hydrogen evolution reaction. This overview focuses on the materials fabrication and the associated challenges in the design and development of TMP-based catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1047-4838	1543-1851		WOS:000742293000010

J	Klotz, D.; Grave, D.A.; Rothschild, A.								Accurate Determination of the Charge Transfer Efficiency of Photoanodes for Solar Water Splitting [arXiv]								arXiv								16 pp.	16 pp.						8 Dec. 2020	2020	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the surface of semiconductor photoanodes involves photo-generated holes that oxidize water. A certain fraction of the holes that reach the surface recombine with electrons from the conduction band, giving rise to the surface recombination loss. The charge transfer efficiency, etat, defined as the ratio between the flux of holes that contribute to the water oxidation reaction and the total flux of holes that reach the surface, is an important parameter that helps to distinguish between bulk and surface recombination losses. However, accurate determination of etat by conventional voltammetry measurements is complicated because only the total current is measured and it is difficult to discern between different contributions to the current. Chopped light measurement and hole scavenger measurement techniques are widely employed to determine etat, but they often lead to errors. Intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) is better suited for accurate determination of etat because it provides direct information on both the total photocurrent and the surface recombination current. Careful analysis of IMPS measurements at different light intensities is required to account for nonlinear effects. We compare the etat values obtained by these methods using heteroepitaxial hematite photoanodes. A wide spread of etat values is obtained by different analysis methods and different light sources and light intensities. Statistical analysis of the results show good correlation between different methods for measurements carried out with the same light source, light intensity and potential. However, there is a considerable spread in the results obtained by different methods. For accurate determination of etat, we recommend IMPS measurements with a bias light intensity such that the irradiance is as close as possible to the standard solar spectrum. [Phys. Chem. Chem.

The calculations are done within the framework of the distorted-wave impulse approximation, by adopting nonrelativistic and relativistic models. We compare the results obtained with three different approaches based on the mean-field description for the proton bound-state wave function. In the nonrelativistic model phenomenological Woods-Saxon and Hartree-Fock wave functions are used; in the relativistic model the wave functions are solutions of Dirac-Hartree equations. The models are first tested against experimental data on O-16, Ca-40, and Ca-48 nuclei, and then they are applied to calculate (e, e' p) cross sections for a set of spherical calcium and oxygen isotopes. From the comparison of the results obtained for the various isotopes we can infer information about the dependence of the various ingredients of the models on the neutron to proton asymmetry.									19	0	0	0	0	0	19			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000294326900005

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can offer the information about the microstructures and chemical compositions of the electrocatalysts on nano and atomic scale, which enables us to establish the synthesis-structure-performance relationship and further direct the design of new electrocatalysts with high performance. In this minireview paper, a brief introduction on the basic characterization of electrocatalysts with TEM, followed by the studying of dynamic evolution of the electrocatalysts in electrochemical reactions with identical location-TEM, is discussed.

Our previous studies have shown that the ultra-sonication treatment in water without chemicals has a positive influence on the physical and electrochemical performance of layered materials and nanoparticles. In this work, we have probed the impact of ultrasonication on the physical properties and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the NiFe LDH materials under various conditions, including suspension concentration (2.5-12.5 mg mL-1), sonication times (3-20 min) and amplitudes (50-90%) in water, in particular, sonication times and amplitudes. We found that the concentration, amplitude and time play significant roles on the exfoliation of the NiFe LDH material. Firstly, the NiFe LDH nanosheets displayed the best OER performance under ultrasonic conditions with the concentration of 10 mg mL-1 (50% amplitude and 15 min). Secondly, it was revealed that the exfoliation of the NiFe LDH nanosheets in a short time (<10 min) or a higher amplitudes (>= 80%) has left a cutdown on the OER activity. Comprehensively, the optimum OER activity was displayed on the exfoliated NiFe LDH materials under ultrasonic condition of 60% (amplitude), 10 mg mL-1 and 15 min. It demanded only 250 mV overpotentials to reach 10 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH, which was 100 mV less than the starting NiFe LDH material. It was revealed from the mechanism of sonochemistry and the OER reaction that, after exfoliation, the promoted OER performance is ascribed to the enriched Fe3+ at the active sites, easier oxidation of Ni2+ to Ni3+, and the strong electrical coupling of the Ni2+ and Fe3+ during the OER process. This work provides a green strategy to improve the intrinsic activity of layered materials.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1350-4177	1873-2828		WOS:000681253200002	34252685

Here, utilizing metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes as the ideal assembly of nanoreactors to disperse and confine gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), we realize the direct plasmonic photocatalytic nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions. Upon visible irradiation, the hot electrons generated on the AuNPs can be directly injected into the N-2 molecules adsorbed on Au surfaces. Such N-2 molecules can be additionally activated by the strong but evanescently localized surface plasmon resonance field, resulting in a supralinear intensity dependence of the ammonia evolution rate with much higher apparent quantum efficiency and lower apparent activation energy under stronger irradiation. Moreover, the gas-permeable Au@MOF membranes, consisting of numerous interconnected nanoreactors, can ensure the dispersity and stability of AuNPs, further facilitate the mass transfer of N-2 molecules and (hydrated) protons, and boost the plasmonic photocatalytic reactions at the designed gas-membrane-solution interface. As a result, an ammonia evolution rate of 18.9 mmol g(Au)(-1) h(-1) was achieved under visible light (>400 nm, 100 mW cm(-2)) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 1.54% at 520 nm.									58	3	0	0	10	0	58			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000643591600022	33847495

Yet currently, efficient catalytic materials for air cathodes are mostly based on expensive and scarce precious metal Pt, which have severely impeded the implantation of AAB. Herein, a series of non-precious binary FeCo-nitrogen-doped carbon (FeCo-NC) materials with heavily loaded Fe/Co species and in-situ generated interconnected carbon nanotube (CNT) were synthesized from cost-effective materials. With merits of dense active sites, largely exposed surface area, and good electron/ionic conductivity, the as-made binary FeCo-NC with optimal synthetic parameters exhibit excellent oxygen reduction reaction performance in alkaline electrolyte, rendering high onset potential of 1.05 V and half-wave potential of 0.91 V, which surpass those of Pt/C by 50 and 40 mV, respectively. Remarkably, the FeCo-NC-assembled AAB delivers an exceptional open-circuit voltage of 1.88 V and a large specific power of 188 mW cm(-2), and additionally maintains high discharge voltage of 1.70 V at the current density of 10.0 mA cm(-2). Our work renders a new type of high-performance air cathode material for AAB implantation.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000523640600005

The incorporation of phosphorus into CoMoO4 can significantly promote the HER activity, and the CoMoO4 bundles phosphorized at 350 degrees C exhibited the optimum activity, which only required low overpotentials of 56 and 148 mV to deliver cathodic current densities of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively. This electrode also presented considerable long-term electrochemical stability with negligible delay after 30 h operation and 3000 accelerated cyclic voltammetry cycles. Our study provides a superior earth-abundant catalyst for efficient HER in alkaline media, which also suggests that P doping engineering is an effective way to boost the HER activity of transition metal-based oxides.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000516492700007

In this article, a novel HER catalyst with heterogeneous structure interfaces was in situ synthesized by multi-step electrodeposition method, and the mechanism of the enhancement of its electrocatalytic activity was elucidated by the combination of density functional theory (DFT) calculation and multi-characterizations. The initial overpotential is only 83 mV and the Tafel slope is only 58.5 mV/dec, which is better than most of other reported CoP-based electrocatalyst. At the meantime, DFT calculations show that the incorporation of MoO3 and rGO leads to electron redistribution among different components, which ensures efficient adsorption and activation of H2O molecules and hydrogen atoms. Therefore, this work will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms associated with heterojunctions and provide guidance for the rational design of a hybrid catalyst.

Several scenarios have been proposed as to how this detonation may actually occur, but the exact mechanism and environment in which it takes place remain unknown. We explore the effects of an off-center initiated detonation on the spatial distribution of the nucleosynthetic yield products in a toy model-a pre-expanded near Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. We find that a single-point near edge-lit detonation results in asymmetries in the density and thermal profiles, notably the expansion timescale, throughout the supernova ejecta. We demonstrate that this asymmetry of the thermodynamic trajectories should be common to off-center detonations where a small amount of the star is burned prior to detonation. The sensitivity of the yields on the expansion timescale results in an asymmetric distribution of the elements synthesized as reaction products. We tabulate the shift in the center of mass of the various elements produced in our model supernova and find an odd-even pattern for elements past silicon. Our calculations show that off-center single-point detonations in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are marked by significant composition asymmetries in their remnants which bear potentially observable signatures in both velocity and coordinate space, including an elemental nickel mass fraction that varies by a factor of 2-3 from one side of the remnant to the other.									11	1	0	0	0	0	11			0004-637X			WOS:000298408300027

Biooxidations using fermentation processes have already conquered some niches in industrial oxidation processes since they allow the introduction of oxygen into non-activated carbon atoms in a sterically and optically selective manner that is difficult or impossible to achieve by synthetic organic chemistry. Biooxidation using isolated enzymes is limited to oxidases and dehydrogenases. Surprisingly, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases have scarcely been studied for use in biooxidations, although they are one of the largest known superfamilies of enzyme proteins. Their gene sequences have been identified in various organisms such as humans, bacteria, algae, fungi, and plants. The reactions catalyzed by P450s are quite diverse and range from biosynthetic pathways (e.g. those of animal hormones and secondary plant metabolites) to the activation or biodegradation of hydrophobic xenobiotic compounds (e.g. those of various drugs in the liver of higher animals). From a practical point of view, the great potential of P450s is limited by their functional complexity, low activity, and limited stability. In addition, P450-catalyzed reactions require a constant supply of NAD(P)H which makes continuous cell-free processes very expensive. Quite recently, several groups have started to investigate cost-efficient ways that could allow the continuous supply of electrons to the heme iron. These include, for example, the use of electron mediators, direct electron supply from electrodes, and enzymatic approaches. In addition, methods of protein design and directed evolution have been applied in an attempt to enhance the activity of the enzymes and improve their selectivity. The promising application of bacterial P450s as catalyzing agents in biocatalytic reactions and recent progress made in this field are both covered in this review.									153	10	0	0	116	0	173			0175-7598	1432-0614		WOS:000220862300003	14716467

However, fine control of the NP size and dispersity remains a big challenge. Herein, we report that by properly selecting the solvent, precursor concentration and carbon support, ultrafine palladium (Pd) NPs with an average size of 3.0 nm uniformly distributed on nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) are radiolytically prepared. Control experiments demonstrate that ethylene glycol with moderate reducibility is a superior solvent to water. Among four graphene-based supports with distinct functionalization or doping, nitrogen dopants outperform oxygen functional groups in anchoring the NPs and controlling their size and dispersity. Pd/NG also affords the lowest eta(10) (overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2)) toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Comparison of Pd/NG with varied Pd loadings indicates that the HER activity nearly reaches a plateau once the loading increases to 2.6 wt%, which is limited by the nitrogen content of NG. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy unambiguously reveals the electron transfer from electron-rich Pd to electron-deficient nitrogen, especially graphitic nitrogen, corroborating the decisive role of doped nitrogen in stabilizing the Pd NPs on NG. Extending this synthesis to platinum (Pt) yields Pt/NG that presents even lower eta(10) than the commercial 10 wt% Pt/carbon black due to the smaller NP size. These results collectively highlight the potential of high-energy photons for green, versatile and scalable synthesis of heterogeneous nanostructures.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000505561500020

However, the structure-activity relationship toward electrocatalysis in conductive MOFs needs to be further explored. Herein, a new strategy of electronic structure modification is proposed by introducing phthalocyanine with extra metal sites into conductive MOFs. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that these MOFs possess excellent conductivity with a narrow band-gap. Electrochemical tests and d-band center calculations confirm the highest activity of NiPc-Ni among the MOFs, indicating that both Ni-N-4 and Ni-O-4 sites are active for the OER. Moreover, PDOS analysis and TOF calculations indicate that the electronic structure interaction between Ni-O-4 and Ni-N-4 sites improves their intrinsic OER activity. This work provides an effective strategy for modulating the electronic structure and revealing the structure-activity relationship in 2D conductive MOFs toward electrocatalysis.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000612470000027

This approach is applied to interpret the physicochemical properties and catalytic performance of a free-standing 2D-3D CeO2-x scaffold, which is comprised of holey 2D nanosheets, and its heterojunctions with MoO3-x and RuO2. The band gap alignment and structural defects are engineered using density functional theory (DFT) simulations and atomic characterization. Further, the heterojunctions are used in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and catalytic ozonation applications, and the impacts of the metal oxide heteroatoms are analyzed. A key outcome is that the principal regulator of the ozonation performance is not oxygen vacancies but the concentration of Ce3+ and Ce vacancies. Cation vacancy defects are measured to be as high as 8.1 at% for Ru-CeO2-x. The homogeneous distribution of chemisorbed, Mo-oxide, heterojunction nanoparticles on the CeO2-x holey nanosheets facilitates intervalence charge transfer, resulting in the dominant effect and resultant approximate to 50% decrease in overpotential for HER. The heterojunctions are tested for aqueous-catalytic ozonation of salicylic acid, revealing excellent catalytic performance from Mo doping despite the adverse impact of Ce vacancies. The present study highlights the use of defect engineering to leverage experimental and DFT results for band alignment.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000669243100001		
J	Yuan, Yue; Li, Hai; Luo, Mingliang; Qin, Song; Luo, Wengfeng; Li, Lixin; Yan, Hongjian								TiO2-Mediated Photodegradation of Aqueous Trinitrophenol Irradiated by an Artificial Light Source								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				225	3					1881	10.1007/s11270-014-1881-5				MAR 2014	2014	TiO2-mediated photodegradation is widely reported to degrade recalcitrant pollutants such as nitrophenolics. This paper investigated the TiO2-mediated photodegradation of trinitrophenol (TNP) in aqueous solution irradiated by an artificial light source. About 28.4 % TNP degradation was attained over 450 min from an initial TNP concentration of 1,000 mg L-1. Ionic chromatographic analysis further revealed the evolution of nitrite and nitrate anions and an unknown intermediate X during the photodegradation process. The trends of nitrite and nitrate anions indicate that the photodegradation process produced nitrite at first, which subsequently turned to nitrate in the presence of oxygen. The removal rate of COD was far slower than that of TNP, inferring the photodegradation reaction gradually mineralized the parent pollutants. The photodegradation of TNP could not proceed under anaerobic condition, presumably a result of oxygen deficiency that disabled the denitration process. Because of the volumetric loss of the test solution, follow-up irradiations were performed after addition of supplementary water. This follow-up irradiation period revealed that direct photolysis, i.e., irradiation in the absence of TiO2 photocatalysts, could not photodegrade TNP but gradually diminish the component X.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000334577800008

Modern FAPs belonging to the order Chloroflexales are divided into two suborders: Chloroflexineae and Roseiflexineae. Representatives of Roseiflexineae lack chlorosomes and synthesize bacteriochlorophyll a, whereas those of Chloroflexineae synthesize bacteriochlorophylls a and c and utilize chlorosomes for light harvesting. Though they constitute a small number of species, FAPs are quite diverse in their physiology. This bacterial group includes autotrophs and heterotrophs, thermophiles and mesophiles, aerobes and anaerobes, occupying both freshwater and halophilic environments. The anaerobic mesophilic autotroph Oscillochloris trichoides DG-6 is still not well studied in its physiology, and its evolutionary origin remains unclear. The goals of this study included identification of the reaction centre type of O. trichoides DG-6, reconstruction of its bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis pathways, and determination of its evolutionary relationships with other FAPs. By enzymic and genomic analysis, the presence of RCII in O. trichoides DG-6 was demonstrated and the complete gene set involved in biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophylls a and c was established. We found that the bacteriochlorophyll gene sets differed between aerobic and anaerobic FAPs. The aerobic FAP genomes code oxygen-dependent AcsF cyclases, but lack the bchO/bchR genes, which have been associated with adaptation to low light conditions in the anaerobic FAPs. A scenario of evolution of FAPs belonging to the order Chloroflexales is proposed.									11	0	0	0	10	0	11			1350-0872	1465-2080		WOS:000356647700012	25336470	
J	Zhang, Xianwen; Li, Zheng; Liu, Taifeng; Li, Mingrun; Zeng, Chaobin; Matsumoto, Hiroaki; Han, Hongxian				zhang, xian/GYA-0290-2022				Water oxidation sites located at the interface of Pt/SrTiO3 for photocatalytic overall water splitting								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				43	8			2223	2230		10.1016/S1872-2067(21)64048-2				AUG 2022	2022	When a proton reduction cocatalyst is loaded on an n-type semiconductor for photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS), the location of water oxidation sites is generally considered at the surface of the semiconductor due to upward band-bending of n-type semiconductor which may ease the transfer of the photogenerated holes to the surface. However, this is not the case for Pt/SrTiO3, a model semiconductor based photocatalyst for POWS. It was found that the photogenerated holes are more readily accumulated at the interface between Pt cocatalyst and SrTiO3 photocatalyst as probed by photo-oxidative deposition of PbO2, indicating that the water oxidation sites are located at the interface between Pt and SrTiO3. Electron paramagnetic resonance and scanning transmission electron microscope studies suggest that the interfacial oxygen atoms between Pt and SrTiO3 in Pt/SrTiO3 after POWS are more readily lost to form oxygen vacancies upon vacuum heat treatment, regardless of Pt loading by photodeposition or impregnation methods, which may serve as additional support for the location of the active sites for water oxidation at the interface. Density functional theory calculations also suggest that the oxygen evolution reaction more readily occurs at the interfacial sites with the lowest overpotential. These experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the more active sites for water oxidation are located at the interface between Pt and SrTiO3, rather than on the surface of SrTiO3. Hence, the tailor design and control of the interfacial properties are extremely important for the achievement or improvement of the POWS on cocatalyst loaded semiconductor photocatalyst.

To reduce the eta(OER) values, a class of novel TM1NM1NM1/g-C3N4 was designed via density functional theory simulations, where TM1 = Fe-1, Co-1 or Ni-1 and NM1 = C-1, N-1 or O-1. Contributing by two extra-NM1 atoms, the OER catalytic activities of these materials were effectively improved owing to the shortened TM1-NM bonds and weakened chemical activity of TM1 atoms. Based on the volcano activity relationship between the theoretical overpotential (eta(OER)) and d band center of the TM1 atom (epsilon(d)), the chemical activity of TM1 atoms needs to be adjusted to a suitable magnitude (epsilon(d) near -4.883 eV) for a good catalytic activity. The designed Fe1C1O1/g-C3N4 with the epsilon(d) of -4.893 eV exhibited an excellent OER catalytic activity of eta(OER) = 0.219 V. This strategy was applied to devise the reaction active sites and highly efficient catalysts by adjusting the chemical activity of the TM1 atom with suitable extra-NM1 atoms.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000647920500001	33959735

The synthesized materials were characterized in terms of morphology, particle size distribution, chemical and phase composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high angle annular dark filed scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF, STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). XPS spectra revealed that Ru atoms were in mainly in Ru(4+) oxidation state, the Ti atoms in Ti(4+) oxidation state, whereas the Pt-atoms were in metallic state. TEM analysis proved that platinum nanoparticles nucleated at both oxide species and homogeneous distribution was observed. The average platinum nanoparticle size was 3.05 nm.Electrochemically active surface area of platinum was 32 m(2) g(-1). Kinetics of the oxygen reduction was studied at rotating disc electrode in 0.5 mol dm(-3) HClO4 solution, at 25 degrees C. The catalytic activities expressed in terms of specific activity (per electrochemically active surface area of platinum) and mass activity (per mass of platinum) were determined and compared to Pt catalyst on carbon support. The high catalytic activity was proven by electrochemical characterization. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000350189800021

Identification of the active sites in heterogeneous catalysis is key for the rational design of low-cost and eff icient catalysts. Here, by fabricating holey graphene with chemically dopants, the atomic-level mechanism for accelerating HER by chemical dopants is unveiled, through elemental mapping with atomistic characterizations, scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that the synergetic effects of two important factors-edge structure of graphene and nitrogen/phosphorous codoping-enhance HER activity. SECCM evidences that graphene edges with chemical dopants are electrochemically very active. Indeed, DFT calculation suggests that the pyridinic nitrogen atom could be the catalytically active sites. The HER activity is enhanced due to phosphorus dopants, because phosphorus dopants promote the charge accumulations on the catalytically active nitrogen atoms. These findings pave a path for engineering the edge structure of graphene in graphene-based catalysts.									57	4	0	0	3	0	59				2198-3844		WOS:000468187200008	31131204	
J	TSAI, EW; RAJESHWAR, K								INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE VOLTAMMETRIC RESPONSE OF THERMAL RUTHENIUM OXIDE ELECTRODES								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				36	1			27	30		10.1016/0013-4686(91)85175-7				1991	1991	Thermal ruthenium oxide (RuO(x)) electrodes were voltammetrically cycled in 0.1 M H2SO4 at varying solution temperatures from 22 to 65-degrees-C. A systematic increase in the voltammetric charge (q) with temperature was noted the magnitude of which was dependent on the oxide loading of the Ti substrate. This increase obeyed an Arrhenius temperature dependence and activation enthalpies of approximately 4-5 kJ mol-1 were deduced from plots of 1n q vs T-1. The magnitude of the activation enthalpy was insensitive to oxide loading in the range 0.7-4.0 mg cm-2 and the switching potential at the upper limit from 0.40 to 0.90 V (vs sce). In stark contrast to the behavior in acidic electrolytes, cyclic voltammograms in 0.1 M K2SO4 revealed negligible temperature dependence at potentials below the O2 evolution reaction. These results are interpreted in terms of a two time-constant model for charge storage/transport in RuO(x) involving the external and interior surfaces of the oxide micropore structure. The temperature dependence is tentatively assigned to a diffusion or hopping mechanism involving protons at the external surfaces of the oxide micropore structure.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0013-4686			WOS:A1991EQ01700005

The present work investigates water adsorption on the clean and defective Cu2O(1 1 1) surfaces using spinpolarized density functional theory. The results show that at low water coverage, only molecular H2O chemisorption is preferred on clean Cu2O(1 1 1) surface, and the water adsorption results in surface reconstruction. Up to 1 monolayer (ML), the adsorbed H2O molecules interact with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu atoms as well as the coordinatively unsaturated surface oxygen atoms via H-bonding. Up to 2 ML, the adsorbed H2O molecules interact with the coordinatively unsaturated surface oxygen atoms and the first layer adsorbed H2O molecules via H-bonding. Ordered surface layer structures are observed at 1 and 2 ML H2O adsorption. In contrast to the clean surface, the defect surface with oxygen vacancy favors dissociative H2O adsorption with the dissociated OH group bridging the surface Cu atoms and the H atom on the coordinatively saturated third layer O atom. The adsorption mechanisms are analyzed on the basis of the total density of states. It is found that wet electron states on the clean and H2O adsorbed Cu2O(1 1 1) surfaces might be important for their photocatalytic properties. Water adsorption on Cu2O surface is stronger than on MgO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and CeO2, while weaker than on Al2O3. The different H2O adsorption mechanisms on different metal oxides may benefit for new H2O-splitting metal oxides catalyst designing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The physicochemical properties of the prepared samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrochemical properties were investigated by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and the stability was studied via accelerated lifetime testing. The electro-catalytic activity of the prepared Ti/SnO2-Sb electrodes was strongly dependent on the amount of the Sb dopant, leading to a change in the OER overpotential. Among the prepared samples, the Ti/SnO2 electrode with 10% of a Sb dopant showed the highest catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and 87% of COD removal with 20 mA cm(-2) of current density for 60 min was achieved in the presence of 10.0 g L-1 of chloride. The findings reported herein suggest that the Ti/SnO2 electrode with an optimized Sb dopant amount shows enhanced electro-catalytic performance by easily generating active hydroxyl radicals, which act as strong oxidizing agents.

Here, the aging duration of a vanadium precursor solution, vanadyl acetylacetonate in methanol, is identified as a factor that profoundly affects reproducibility. Substantial changes in structural, optical, and electrical properties of BVO films are observed upon varying aging time of vanadium precursor solutions, which subsequently impacts photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation and sulfite oxidation reactions. With the optimum number of aging days (3 d), some deficiency of oxygen is observed, which is accompanied by an increase in carrier concentration and a reduced charge transfer resistance in the PEC device, which produces the highest PEC performance that is comparable to the state-of-the-art undoped BVO photoanodes. The findings point to the importance of understanding solution chemistry and demonstrate that utilization of the understanding of fine adjustment of the composition of BVO films can produce highly reproducible and efficient BiVO4 photoanodes.									10	2	0	0	0	0	10			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000535358900003

Similarly, on heating a mixture of Y2O3 and NH4HF2, the reaction proceeds sequentially through the formation of (NH4)(3)Y2F9, NH4Y2F7 and finally YF3. Any Y2O3 still remaining reacts with YF3 to form yttrium oxyfluorides, which continue as impurity. Substantial evaporation of NH4HF2 is possible even before it could participate in the reaction. This disturbs the stoichiometry of the charge causing oxygen to remain in final YF3. The compound reported in literature as YF3 center dot 1.5NH(3) appears to be NH4Y2F7. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

C	Shariffuddin, Jun Haslinda; Yean, Wong Chee; Ghazali, Siti Shariah								Investigating the catalytic properties of calcium compounds derived from marine based shell waste for wastewater treatment								MATERIALS TODAY-PROCEEDINGS				5	10	SI		21718	21727						2018	2018	Marine based shell wastes are considered as under-exploited natural resources in Malaysia. Thus, the present study was concerned with the utilisation of cockle shells to be transformed into calcium oxide (CaO) for the treatment of methylene blue (MB). The synthesised CaO was produced from the calcination of cockle shell at temperature of 900 degrees C. The characterization of CaO for pre and post reaction powder were performed by using XRD, TGA, BET, FTIR, SEM and EDX. The effect of several operational parameters such as oxidant and stirring speed on the solution have been studied. The experimental results revealed that the reaction of 2.5g/L of CaO under oxygen rich condition with stirring speed of 500 rpm gave the highest MB removal rate with 64% within 2 hour of reaction time. Furthermore, from the analysis on the post reaction powder, it was found that the reaction with CaO was not adsorption but was possibly due to the advanced oxidation process (AOP) that was highly accelerated in the alkaline condition. In short, the utilisation of CaO derived from cockle shell showed a good degradation of MB. This has opened up a newer and greener route for recovering and recycling of waste shells into valuable calcium compounds that can be used extensively in environmental remediation.

Here, we report a facile method for tuning both charger transfer and sorption-desorption properties of NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by intercalating a conductive polymer of polypyrrole (ppy) via an interlayer confined polymerization synthesis (ICPS) process. Ex situ characterizations and in situ electrochemical quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation (EQCM-D) tracking experiments showed that the intercalated ppy not only improved the charge transfer property of the resulting hybrid catalyst LDH-ppy but also made it more flexible and adaptive for quick and reversible sorption-desorption of reactants and intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Consequently, the as-prepared LDH-ppy exhibited a doubled catalytic current density over the bare LDH, as visualized by in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) at the subnanometer scale. This work sheds light on orchestrating the charge and sorbate transfer abilities of catalysts for efficient water splitting by smartly combining inorganic and organic layers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000685245800037	34318664	
J	Lovato, Maria Eugenia; Martin, Carlos A.; Cassano, Alberto E.								A reaction kinetic model for ozone decomposition in aqueous media valid for neutral and acidic pH								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				146	3			486	497		10.1016/j.cej.2008.11.001				FEB 15 2009	2009	A kinetic scheme for ozone decomposition in aqueous media has been developed. It can be applied for an extended range of pHs from acidic to neutral operating conditions. All experiments were made in a homogeneous medium under an assured kinetic controlling regime. Under no circumstances, a headspace existed in the reactor volume. The starting point of the reaction was always under the prerequisite of a true state of initial equilibrium conditions for the mixture water-ozone-oxygen. The model, that is not intended to be a true reaction mechanism, was derived from the 18 reaction steps mechanism proposed by Buhler et al. [R.E. Buhler. J. Staehelin, J. Hoigne. Ozone decomposition in water studied by pulse radiolysis. 1. HO2/O-2(-) and HO3/O-3(-) as intermediates. J. Phys. Chem. 88 (1984) 2560-2564] and Staehelin et al. [J. Staehelin, R.E. Buhler, J. Hoigne, Ozone decomposition in water studied by pulse radiolysis. 2. OH and HO4 as chain intermediates. J. Phys. Chem. 88 (1984) 5999-6004]. Most of the kinetic constants are known, but unfortunately they have not been obtained at the same pH (variations from 0.9 to almost 13 exist) and in one particular case was the result of a parametric estimation resorting to assumptions about the value of four other unknown constants in the proposed reaction sequence. With an accurate phenomenological modification represented by an analytical expression, a function of pH was introduced in what was found to be the most critical constant of the previously mentioned mechanism. The resulting set of reactions steps reproduces with very good agreement experiments made at pH 3, 4.8 and 6.3. These results should be useful to be applied as background information to analyze the use of ozone to degrading chlorinated organic compounds that render reaction by products (HCl), which reduce the pH of the reacting medium along the reaction evolution. Thus, the ultimate objective of this work is to derive a working and practical reaction sequence valid under these variable operating conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a hybrid of Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles strongly encapsulated in a nitrogen-doped carbon (N-C) hollow shell is prepared through the thermoelectrochemical treatment of Fe2O3@polydopamine (Fe2O3@PDA) in molten NaCl-CaCl2 at 600 degrees C. The coupling of the thermal pyrolysis of PDA and electrochemical reduction of Fe2O3 contributes to generating Fe/Fe3C species at a relatively low temperature, ensuring structural integrity and in situ N doping for the hybrid to achieve a well-defined hollow structure and abundant active sites of Fe-N and C-N species. The hollow carbon skeleton guarantees efficient mass transfer and maximum exposure of active sites. Consequently, Fe/Fe3C@N-C exhibits appealing activity for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution and Fenton-like reaction and importantly, it can be readily separated for reuse by a magnetic field.									25	5	0	0	0	0	25			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000519218200010

Herein, a nickel nanoparticle/carbon quantum dot (Ni/CQD) hybrid is synthesized and evaluated as an electrocatalyst for HER under a strongly alkaline medium (1 M KOH solution). The obtained Ni/CQD hybrid shows good catalytic ability for HER with an onset potential comparable to that of Pt wire and a low Tafel slope of 98 mV dec(-1), which may be attributed to the Ni-O-C interface between Ni NPs and CQDs. The Ni/CQDs also exhibit high stability after 1000 CV cycles with negligible current loss (around 1 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, the catalytic ability of Ni/CQDs can be further improved under visible light illumination, suggested by a lower Tafel slope of 77 mV dec(-1).									66	6	0	0	4	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000360490600033

Electrochemical behaviour of bismuth in sulfuric acid solution								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				158	2	SI		1096	1101		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.01.093				AUG 25 2006	2006	Bismuth is considered to be a detrimental element to lead-acid batteries because it has lower hydrogen evolution overpotential than lead. On the other hand, bismuth can improve the performances of negative or positive active-materials. It is necessary to understand the performance of bismuth in sulfuric acid solution in order to reduce its detrimental effect on lead-acid batteries and make good use of its beneficial aspects. In this paper, the electrochemical behaviour of bismuth in sulfuric acid solution is studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning electronic spectroscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). At potentials near close to the open-circuit value bismuth dissolves actively when it is anodized. As the potential increases, two oxidation peaks are observed. The first peak corresponds to the formation of bismuth sulfate, that follows a dissolution-precipitation mechanism and suppresses the dissolution of bismuth. The second peak due to secondary oxidation of bismuth under the bismuth sulfate film. There is a large current plateau at higher potentials this involves the dissolution of bismuth sulfate into solution, the formation of bismuth sulfate from bismuth oxide, and the formation of bismuth oxide from matrix bismuth. Hydrogen evolution takes place on bismuth just after the potential where the reduction of lead sulfate is completed. Oxygen evolution cannot occur on bismuth covered with bismuth sulfate.

Lanthanum cobaltite (LaCoO3) perovskite is an active catalyst for OER in alkaline solutions, and it is expected to be a low-cost alternative to the state-of-the-art catalysts (IrO2 and RuO2) because transition metals are abundant and inexpensive. For efficient catalysis with LaCoO3, nanosized LaCoO3 with a high surface area is desirable for increasing the number of catalytically active sites. In this study, we developed a novel synthetic route for LaCoO3 nanoparticles by accumulating the precursor molecules over nanocarbons. This precursor accumulation (PA) method for LaCoO3 nanoparticle synthesis is simple and involves the following steps: (1) a commercially available carbon powder is soaked in a solution of the nitrate salts of lanthanum and cobalt and (2) the sample is dried and calcined in air. The LaCoO3 nanoparticles prepared by the PA method have a high specific surface area (12 m(2) g(-1)), comparable to that of conventional LaCoO3 nanoparticles. The morphology of the LaCoO3 nanoparticles is affected by the nanocarbon type, and LaCoO3 nanoparticles with diameters of less than 100 nm were obtained when carbon black (Ketjen black) was used as the support. Further, the sulfur impurities in nanocarbons significantly influence the formation of the perovskite structure. The prepared LaCoO3 nanoparticles show excellent OER activity owing to their high surface area and perovskite structure. The Tafel slope of these LaCoO3 nanoparticles is as low as that of the previously reported active LaCoO3 catalyst. The results strongly suggest that the PA method provides nanosized LaCoO3 without requiring the precise control of chemical reactions, harsh conditions, and/or special apparatus, indicating that it is promising for producing active OER catalysts at a large scale.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2046-2069		WOS:000664284900037	35479911

The OctGlc preparation had high rates of oxygen evolution and when subjected to size-exclusion HPLC and sucrose density gradient centrifugation, in the presence of DodGlc(2), separated into dimeric (430 kDa), monomeric (236 kDa) photosystem II cores and a fraction containing photosystem II light-harvesting complex (Lhcb) proteins. The dimeric core fraction was more stable, contained higher levels of chlorophyll, beta-carotene and plastoquinone per photosystem II reaction centre and had a higher oxygen-evolving activity than the monomeric cores. Their subunit composition was similar (CP43, CP47, D1, D2, cytochrome b 559 and several lower-molecular-mass components) except that the level of 33-kDa extrinsic protein was lower in the monomeric fraction. Direct solubilisation of photosystem-II-enriched membranes with DodGlc(2), followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, yielded a super complex (700 kDa) containing the dimeric form of the photosystem II core and Lhcb proteins: Lhcb1, Lhcb2, Lhcb4 (CP29), and Lhcb5 (CP26). Like the dimeric and monomeric photosystem II core complexes, the photosystem II-LHCII complex had lost the 23-kDa and 17-kDa extrinsic proteins, but maintained the 33-kDa protein and the ability to evolve oxygen. It is suggested, with a proposed model, that the isolated photosystem II-LHCII super complex represents an in vivo organisation that can sometimes form a lattice in granal membranes of the type detected by freeze-etch electron microscopy [Seibert, M., DeWit, M. & Staehelin, L.

PCC 6803 mutant (DELTA-psbO) lacking the extrinsic manganese-stabilizing protein (MSP) exhibits impaired, but significant levels of H2O-Splitting activity [Burnap, R., & Sherman, L. A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 440-446]. [C-14]DCMU-binding experiments now show that the number and affinity of DCMU-binding sites (normalized to chlorophyll) are equivalent in DELTA-psbO and the wild type, suggesting equal concentrations of assembled reaction centers. A similar conclusion is reached on the basis of measurements of PSII electron transport (DPC-supported DCPIP reduction) by mutant and wild-type thylakoids. The pattern of flash O2 yield by DELTA-psbO cells measured with a bare platinum electrode exhibits a period four oscillation (with a maximum on the third flash), indicating that the H2O-splitting enzyme in DELTA-psbO retains the basic mechanistic features found in normal cells. However, the amplitude of these signals is smaller and more highly damped than those obtained from wild-type cells, suggesting the absence of MSP results in a higher miss probability and/or a reduction in the number of centers competent in oxygen evolution, Analysis of the rise kinetics of the ampermeric signal on the bare platinum electrode indicates that the S3-[S4]-S0 transition is retarded by at least a factor of 5 in the mutant. Thermoluminescence emission peak temperatures indicate that the S2Q(A)-, S2Q(B)-, and S3Q(B)- charge pairs are significantly more stable with respect to recombination in the mutant. The intensities of the thermoluminescence emissions are also significantly reduced in the mutant. Taken together, the data suggest that functional consequences of the genetic removal of MSP are complex. Although the number of photochemically active PSII reaction centers is not much changed by the absence of MSP, the proportion of centers which are coupled to functional O2-evolving enzymes appears to be reduced. For those centers which are effectively coupled to O2 evolution, we find evidence of alterations in the kinetic properties of the enzyme due to the absence of MSP. These are (1) an increased miss factor, (2) a retardation of the S3-[S4]-S0 transition, and (3) an increase in the stabilization of the S2 and S3 states.									109	0	1	0	102	0	110			0006-2960			WOS:A1992JJ57800027	1510930

The crystal structure, morphology evolution and thermal stability of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The morphology of WO3-x nanowires is closely related to the pH value and oleamine content of the reaction system. By controlling the reaction conditions, a linear product with a diameter of less than 2 nm can be obtained, and the exposed active lattice plane is 110 crystal face. On this basis, the prepared ultrafine WO3-x nanowire sensor was tested for a series of harmful gases. The sensitivity of WO3-x based gas sensors can reach 57.9 for 10 ppm NO2 at 100 degrees C, which is much higher than most reported values. The sensor has the excellent sensing performance of ppm NO2 at low operating temperature, which is due to its nanowire structure and oxygen vacancies. These results demonstrate that this type of sensor is a competitive candidate for NO2-sensing applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we examine the role of an early episode of massive star formation that would induce a strong destruction of D and a galactic wind. We discuss the ability of these models to match the observed local properties of the solar neighborhood such as the gas mass fraction, oxygen abundance, the age-metallicity relation, and the present-day mass function. We also examine in detail the ability of the chemical evolution models discussed to reproduce the apparent lack of low-mass, low-metallicity stars in the solar neighborhood, namely the G-dwarf distribution. Indeed, we find models which satisfy the above constraints while at the same time allowing for a large primordial D/H ratio as is reportedly measured in some quasar absorption systems at high z, without the overproduction of heavy elements. The latter constraint is achieved by employing a simple dynamical model for a galactic wind.									58	0	0	0	0	0	58			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:A1997WH85800008

The unique capabilities of APPES enable us to observe water dissociation and monitor formation of surface species on pure and Ni-modified CoOOH under elevated pressures and temperatures for the first time. Over a large range of pressures (UHV to 1 Torr), water dissociates readily on the pure and Ni-modified CoOOH surfaces at 27 degrees C. With an increase in H2O pressure, a greater degree of surface hydroxylation was observed for all samples. At 1 Torr H2O, ratios of different oxygen species indicate a transformation of CoOOH to CoOxHy in pure and Ni-modified CoOOH. In temperature dependent studies, desorption of weakly bound water and surface dehydroxylation were observed with increasing temperature. Larger percentages of surface hydroxyl groups at higher temperatures were observed on Ni-modified CoOOH compared to pure CoOOH, which indicates an increased stability of surface hydroxyl groups on these Ni-modified surfaces.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1520-6106			WOS:000423140600051	28880553

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) constitute a large family(1) of enzymes of particular interest in this regard. Their biological functions, such as detoxification of xenobiotics and steroidogenesis(2-5), are based on the ability to catalyse the insertion of oxygen into:a wide variety of compounds(6). Such a catalytic transformation might find technological applications in areas ranging from gene therapy and environmental remediation to the selective synthesis of pharmaceuticals and chemicals(7-10). But relatively low turnover rates (particularly towards non-natural substrates), low stability and the need for electron-donating cofactors prohibit the practical use of P450s as isolated enzymes. Here we report the directed evolution(11) of the P450 from Pseudomonas putida to create mutants that hydroxylate naphthalene in the absence of cofactors through the 'peroxide shunt' pathway(12,13) with more than 20-fold higher activity than the native enzyme. We are able to screen efficiently for improved mutants by coexpressing them with horseradish peroxidase, which converts the products of the P450 reaction into fluorescent compounds amenable to digital imaging screening. This system should allow us to select and develop mono- and di-oxygenases into practically useful biocatalysts for the hydroxylation of a wide range of aromatic compounds.									336	10	1	0	222	0	400			0028-0836			WOS:000080932800054	10385118

Nucleotide sequence analysis suggested that the major flavin reductase of V. fischeri consisted of 218 amino acids and had a calculated molecular weight of 24,562. Cloned flavin reductase expressed in Escherichia coli was purified virtually to homogeneity, and its basic biochemical properties were examined. As in the major flavin reductase in crude extracts of V. fischeri, cloned flavin reductase showed broad substrate specificity and served well as a catalyst to supply reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH(2)) to the bioluminescence reaction. The major flavin reductase of V. fischeri not only showed significant similarity in amino acid sequence to oxygen-insensitive NAD(P)H nitroreductases of Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli but also was associated with a low level of nitroreductase activity. The major flavin reductase of V. fischeri and the nitroreductases of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae would thus appear closely related in evolution and form a novel protein family.									98	2	2	0	91	0	103			0021-9193			WOS:A1994NQ76400012	8206830

A Cu2+-NO complex and nitrito-nitrato complexes were identified, at 308 K on the oxidized surface. The initial evolution of N2O during dynamic adsorption experiments is related to the existence of cus Cu+ sites on the surface. The Cu2+-NO complexes dissociate with evolution of NO between 350 and 450 K, while nitrio complexes decompose with evolution of NO and simultaneous formation of nitrato complexes between 450 and 600 K. The latter groups finally decompose between 600 and 750 K with evolution of NO and O2.NO is chemisorbed on metallic Cu(o) on the reduced materials at 308 K. On increasing exposure and at higher temperatures, Cu2+-CO complexes are additionally formed, this being suggestive of surface reoxidation. Initially, the reduced surface is active for NO dissociation as evidenced by N2 and N2O evolution. Oxygen ad-atoms are retained on the surface and lead to surface and bulk reoxidation. N2O evolution is correlated with the presence of Cu+ sites. The surface and bulk metal particles are continuously oxidized during adsorption-desorption cycles and the TDS profiles for NO and N2O progressively approach those observed for the original oxidized sample. This suggests a reconstitution of the original surface spinel phase even under comparative mild reoxidation conditions. Evidence for the formation of a copper nitride, CuN, phase is also reported, which can be observed as long as metallic Cu(o) is still present in the material. It is believed that these results bear relevance for the redox processes possibly occurring during catalytic reduction of nitric oxide.									63	0	0	0	1	0	63			0956-5000			WOS:A1992HD74500010		
J	Hong, Wei; Feng, Xin; Tan, Lianqiao; Guo, Aiming; Lu, Bing; Li, Jing; Wei, Zidong								Preparation of monodisperse ferrous nanoparticles embedded in carbon aerogelsvia in situsolid phase polymerization for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction								NANOSCALE				12	28			15318	15324		10.1039/d0nr01219j				JUL 28 2020	2020	Core-shell structured materials constructed by using Fe/Fe3C cores and nitrogen doped carbon shells represent a type of promising non-precious oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst due to well-established active sites at the interface positions. However, the traditional liquid phase polymerization route for preparing such materials normally leads to a compact macropore-deficient structure with randomly dispersed metallic nanoparticles, which is not beneficial for mass transfer and the formation of a high-density dispersion of active sites. Herein, we report an "in situsolid phase polymerization strategy" in which a frozen block containing uniformly dispersed oligomers is firstly achieved by combining a well-controlled hydrothermal reaction and a subsequent liquid nitrogen-facilitated fast solidification. During the following freeze-dry process, the oligomersin situpolymerize into a 3D highly cross-linked network in the confined space of the ice block which not only effectively avoids the direct stacking of polymerized intermediates, but also prevents the agglomeration of metallic nanoparticles. The finally obtained monodisperse Fe/Fe3C nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon aerogel catalyst, in the ORR, delivers an ultrahigh activity as the half-wave potential and the kinetic current density at 0.9 V reach 0.919 V and 7.83 mA cm(-2)respectively in an alkaline solution. Using this route, a range of aerogel materials with improved performances for various applications may be explored.									3	2	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000552498200031	32648875

It was found that RH degassing had a much stronger ability than LF refining in removing inclusions. Total oxygen (TO) can be further reduced from 0.0013 to 0.0015 mass pct to about 0.00047 mass pct without too much difficulty by elongating RH degassing time to 33 minute. Inclusions larger than 5 mu m were decreased from 1.49 to 0.08 N/mm(2) with a removal ratio of about 94 pct. During secondary refining, inclusions experienced continuous evolution from Al2O3 to the MgO-Al2O3, CaO-MgO-Al2O3, and CaO-Al2O3 system due to complex reactions among slag, steel, and refractory materials. Because of more efficient removal of solid inclusions, especially those large ones during RH treatment, thorough modification of solid inclusions into liquid CaO-MgO-Al2O3 can be achieved. Reoxidation during casting resulted in an obvious rise in Al2O3 content in inclusions, which offset the efforts made during secondary refining. Liquid CaO-Al2O3 systems after RH were changed to solid CaO-Al2O3, MgO-Al2O3, or CaO-MgO-Al2O3 again. Large inclusions with sizes approaching several hundred micron were frequently observed in casting bloom by a vast area of scanning under an automatic scanning electron microscope despite very low TO of about 0.00059 mass pct. A total of 78 pct of them were cluster-shaped CaO-MgO-Al2O3 solid inclusions with sizes as large as 200-330 mu m. Most clusters over 100 mu m were constituted by smaller particles with similar chemical compositions to other small singular inclusions in steel, which indicated that they were formed due to the aggregations of small inclusions during casting. Moreover, the location of them indicated a close relationship to the solidification microstructure of steel, which has not been covered before. It was impressively found that larger inclusions were mainly in the column grain zone area, while those in the central equiax grain zone of the bloom had smaller sizes.									13	8	0	0	0	0	20			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000379510000029

Loo, Leslie/G-6225-2010				Synthesis and thermal oxidative degradation of a novel amorphous polyamide/nanoclay nanocomposite								POLYMER				50	12			2643	2654		10.1016/j.polymer.2009.04.011				JUN 5 2009	2009	A novel amorphous polyamide/montmorillonite nanocomposite based on poly(hexamethylene isophthalamide) was successfully prepared by melt intercalation. Wide angle X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy showed that organoclay containing quaternary an-fine surfactant with phenyl groups was delaminated in the polymer matrix, resulting in well-dispersed morphologies even at high montmorillonite content. Thermal oxidation behavior of the polymer nanocomposites was Studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and the chemical evolution in the solid residue was monitored by elemental analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (MR). TGA results showed that the addition of well-dispersed organoclay resulted in a substantial increase (30 IQ in the onset degradation temperature of the nanocomposites as compared to the homopolymer. Elemental analysis on the solid residue indicated that the presence of nanoclay resulted in char formation with greater thermal stability. FTIR spectra showed that thermal degradation in air occurred via both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms simultaneously. In the homopolymer, the oxidative mechanism was more dominant. However, with the addition of well-dispersed organoclay, the non-oxidative pathway became more significant. Hence the presence of delaminated nanoclay layers could effectively retard thermo-oxidative degradation ofthe amorphous polymer by constraining the polymer chains and slowing down the rate of oxygen diffusion through the nanocomposites, but it was not as effective in hindering the non-oxidative degradation reaction pathway.

The oxide powders are synthesized by the citrate-nitrate method. Structural and surface characterizations are performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), while the morphology is studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electrochemical studies are carried out by linear voltamperometry, cyclic voltamperometry, and impedance spectroscopy. The doped and undoped electrocatalyst composites (La2-x-yNdxPryNiO4 +/-delta/C), made of the rare earth nickel oxides mixed with carbon black (Vulcan XC-72(C)), are deposited as a thin layer on a glassy carbon substrate. At room temperature, the undoped electrocatalyst La2NiO4 +/-delta material shows single-step kinetics unlike the doped materials. The doping by the rare earths Nd or/and Pr significantly enhances the electrical conductivity of the electrode under air and the diffusion of oxygen. On the other hand, the steric hindrance between the atomic oxygen orbital (pi-orbital (O-2)-pi-orbital (O-2)) and the dz(2)-orbital (Ni)-pi-orbital (O-2) influences the training model of the liaison (dz(2)(Ni)-pi (O-2)). The structure, oxygen adsorption, and oxidation states of the catalyst elements have a large influence on the mechanism and kinetics of the ORR. The LNNO3/C and LNPNO5/C electrocatalysts have better electrocatalytic performances, which allow them to be used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the reduction of oxygen in alkaline media.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000476796200029

The concept of the photosynthetic unit of the 1930s (Robert Emerson, William Arnold and Hans Gaffron), needing one reaction center per hundreds of antenna molecules, was modified by the discovery of the Enhancement effect in oxygen evolution in two different wavelengths of light (Robert Emerson and his coworkers) in the late 1950s, followed by the 1960 Z scheme of Robin Hill and Fay Bendall. It was realized that two light reactions and two pigment systems were needed for oxygenic photosynthesis. Changing ideas about the distribution of Photosystem II (PS II) and PS I between the green-appressed and stroma-exposed thylakoid membrane domains, which led to the concept of lateral heterogeneity, are discussed.									34	1	0	0	27	0	35			0166-8595			WOS:000178321400021	16245117

Their role in these processes is due to one or more of the following: the redox potential of the couple CO3 center dot-/CO32- is considerably lower than that of OH center dot/H2O or that of OH center dot/OH-. The CO3 center dot- thus formed is transformed into HCO4-/H2O2. The latter are easily oxidized to form O-2. Furthermore CO32- as a ligand stabilizes transition metal complexes at high-oxidation states that are essential intermediates in the catalytic processes. Finally, the carbonate facilitates proton transfer near the anode that is often an essential step.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0898-8838	1557-8917	978-0-12-816082-4	WOS:000501573300009

It was found that with the presence of ferrocyanide. the charging voltage can be leveled off just above the complete oxidation of the positive nickel electrode. As a result, the oxygen evolution was greatly suppressed and the internal pressure of the batteries was kept at low level even at prolonged overcharging. In addition, no detrimental effects of the redox additive were observed on the normal charge-discharge performance of Ni-MH batteries. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

In these electrolytes a valve-metal behavior is observed, due to the anodic growth of passive surface layers having insulating properties. A noticeable electronic current accompanies the film growth, substained by the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (o.e.r.). Photoelectrochemical experiments have been carried out for characterizing passive films grown potentiodynamically: the analysis of the photocurrent spectra reveals a composite structure of the oxide films, with external more hydrated layers. By taking into account also previous results on defective trihydride formed on yttrium by chemical etching in sulphuric acid solution, a correlation is proposed between the optical band gap of phases containing Y3+ species and the electronegativity of the anionic group.

F1000Research				8							10.12688/f1000research.19324.1				2019	2019	The nucleolytic ribozymes carry out site-specific RNA cleavage reactions by nucleophilic attack of the 2'-oxygen atom on the adjacent phosphorus with an acceleration of a million-fold or greater. A major part of this arises from concerted general acid-base catalysis. Recent identification of new ribozymes has expanded the group to a total of nine and this provides a new opportunity to identify sub-groupings according to the nature of the general base and acid. These include nucleobases, hydrated metal ions, and 2'-hydroxyl groups. Evolution has selected a number of different combinations of these elements that lead to efficient catalysis. These differences provide a new mechanistic basis for classifying these ribozymes.									17	0	0	0	9	0	17				2046-1402		MEDLINE:31489181	31489181

In this regard, their controllable synthesis in a large scale at low cost has readily become a focus of research. Herein we report diatomite-template generic and scalable production of VS2 and other transition metal sulfides targeting emerging energy conversion and storage applications. The conformal growth of VS2 over diatomite template would endow them with defect-abundant features. Throughout detailed experimental investigation in combination with theoretical simulation, we reveal that the enriched active sites/sulfur vacancies of thus-derived VS2 architectures would pose positive impacts on the catalytic performance such in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reactions. We further show that the favorable electrical conductivity and highly exposed sites of VS2 hold promise for serving as sulfur host in the realm of Li-S batteries. Our work offers new insights into the templated and customized synthesis of defect-rich sulfides in a scalable fashion to benefit multifunctional energy applications.

To mitigate carbon corrosion, Pt is alloyed with iridium (Ir), which is catalytically active for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with various compositions of PtxIry. The carbon-supported PtxIry alloy catalysts (PtxIry/C) show slightly lower initial activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) than Pt/C. However, the ORR activities of the PtxIry/C catalysts increase with repeating potential cycles from 1.0 to 1.5 V-RHE, while Pt/C exhibits a rapid decay in the ORR activity and a mixture of Pt/C and Ir/C (Pt/C + Ir/C, Pt-to-Ir ratio of 85:15) maintains its initial activity. After 5k potential cycles, the mass activity of Pt85Ir15 was 0.071 A mg(PGM)(-1), which is significantly higher than that of Pt/C (0.017 A mg(PGM)(-1)) and Pt/C + Ir/C (0.039 A mg(PGM)(-1)). These results can be attributed to the atomically distributed Ir in Pt85Ir15. Clearly, carbon corrosion occurs in Pt/C and in Pt-rich regions of Pt/C + Ir/C, whereas the carbon support in Pt85Ir15/C is effectively protected from corrosion. As a result, the greatest amount of CO2 emission is detected as coming from Pt/C, followed by Pt/C + Ir/C and Pt85Ir15/C. During the potential cycles, high-index Pt facets are formed on the surface of Pt85Ir15/C, leading to an increase in the ORR activity. When employed as cathode catalysts of a PEMFC, Pt85Ir15/C exhibits improved durability compared to Pt/C and Pt/C + Ir/C under high-voltage cycles to 1.5 V (5k cycles). This work demonstrates that the atomic distribution of Ir in Pt is an effective strategy for mitigating corrosion of the carbon support and to enhance the durability of PEMFCs exposed to high potentials.									15	1	0	0	1	0	16			2155-5435			WOS:000614389200053

BMO films are grown on Niobium doped SrTiO3 crystalline substrates using pulse laser deposition. Nanoscale patterns of BMO are obtained by depositing through nano stencils, namely shadow masks with nanometer-scale circular apertures. We demonstrate that BMO nanostructures exhibit superior photoelectrochemical properties, compared to BMO thin films when used as photoelectrodes in cells for hydrogen production. A photocurrent density of similar to 0.9 mA cm(-2) at 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl (1.38 V vs RHE) under 1 Sun is recorded for BMO nanostructures. On the other hand, BMO films exhibit a photocurrent density of similar to 40 mu A cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl (0.98 V vs RHE) under 2 Sun which is four times higher than that recorded under 1 Sun illumination (similar to 10 mu A cm(-2) at 0.4 V vs Ag/AgCl). Mott-Schottky analysis evidences n-type characteristics for both BMO thin films and nano structures. According to band alignment with respect to the redox potential of water, we conclude that both types of photoelectrodes are suitable for oxygen evolution reaction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It is shown that green algae, much like cyanophytes and higher plants, adjust and optimize the ratio of the two photosystems in chloroplasts in response to the quality of irradiance during growth. Such adjustments are compensation reactions and help C. reinhardtii to retain a quantum efficiency of oxygen evolution near the theoretical maximum. Results show variable amounts of PS I and a fairly constant amount of PS II in chloroplasts and suggest that photosystem stoichiometry adjustments, occurring in response to the quality of irradiance during plant growth, are mainly an adjustment in the concentration of PS I. The work delineates chromatic effects on chlorophyll accumulation in the chloroplast of C reinhardtii from those pertaining to the regulation of the PS I/PS II ratio. The detection of the operation of a molecular feedback mechanism for the PS VPS II ratio adjustment in green algae strengthens the notion of the highly conserved nature of this mechanism among probably all oxygen evolving photosynthetic organisms. Findings in this work are expected to serve as the basis of future biochemical and mutagenesis experiments for the elucidation of the photosystem ratio adjustment in oxygenic photosynthesis.									65	0	0	0	58	0	65			0166-8595			WOS:A1996VD43900006	24301992	
J	Skrypnyk, ID; Hoekstra, HD; Spoormaker, JL								Modeling of localized degradation in polymers under stress								POLYMER DEGRADATION AND STABILITY				60	1			21	31		10.1016/S0141-3910(96)00229-7				1998	1998	In this paper a model is presented which describes the mechanism of localized UV-degradation at the micro scale. The classical auto-oxidation scheme, derived by Bolland, is taken as a basis. A system of evolution equations has been derived. Unlike most studies, the equations not only model the change of molecular fractions caused by chemical reactions or oxygen diffusion, but also take into account the motions of the polymer chains. Furthermore, the system was not oversimplified by the so-called 'assumption in the termination process: k(5)(2) = k(4) x k(6)'. From the derived system of evolution equations the following conclusions can be drawn. The system has two threshold values of controlling parameters. Under the lower threshold value no deviations occur and all concentration fluctuations from the uniform distribution diminish in time. Above the higher threshold value the uniform state of oxidation products cannot exist and more complex distributions will form. Localized peaks on top of the quite homogeneous distribution can occur in addition to uniform states, if the controlling parameters are between the lower and upper thresholds.

The nanoscale Co3O4-x bubbles with tailored defects are encapsulated by porous carbon matrix and construct the lotus root-like multichannel structure. The porous and conductive carbon based substrate enables the fast electron/ion transport and facilitates highly reversible redox reaction. In addition, the engineered defects of Co3O4-x bubbles and the multichannels inside the nanofiber provide abundant active sites and ensure the high bifunctional activities towards oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) reactions. Meanwhile, the good mechanical characteristics and unique structure enable it a good flexible electrode with high areal mass loading and superior electrochemical properties. Accordingly, the MCB nanofiber is a highly efficient platform to synergistically achieve fast kinetics, high energy/power density and excellent durability. For the first time, the formation mechanism of the MCB nanofiber is probed. The relationship between the oxygen vacancies regulated by Kirkendall effect and the electrochemical performance of the electrode is clarified. Moreover, the fabricated fiber-shaped HZB achieves high energy density, superior high-rate capability and long-term cycling stability. Even after high-rate and long-term cycling, it still retains the characteristic two-set charge/discharge profiles and high energy efficiency. More impressively, it exhibits high durability in different outside deformation, working environments or even during working condition transitions.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000607595600006		
J	Li, Yiju; Zhou, Yin; Shang, Changshuai; Yousaf, Muhammad; Guo, Ziqi; Guo, Shaojun								Emerging Metal Single-Atom Materials: From Fundamentals to Energy Applications								ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH											10.1021/accountsmr.2c00119		OCT 2022			2022	With the development of nanotechnology and characterization techniques, it has been realized that the reactivity of metal nanoparticles mainly depends on some unsaturated coordination atoms on the surface. However, only a small fraction of the surface exposed atoms can access the reactants and act as reactive sites, resulting in low utilization of metal atoms. Moreover, due to the complex structure of metal nanoparticles, the metal atoms exposed on the surface are likely to be in different chemical environments and may act as multiple active centers to catalyze the reactants, which brings great difficulties in the establishment of the structure- activity relationship of metal nanoparticles. Reducing the size of metal nanoparticles to increase the fraction of atoms on the surface is usually regarded as a straightforward and effective approach to enhancing their activity. When the metal nanoparticles are transformed into metal subnanoclusters or even metal single atoms (MSAs), discrete energy-level distribution and distinctive lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-highest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO- HOMO) gap are generated due to the unique quantum size effect. Because of the uniform active sites, maximum metal utilization, unsaturated coordination environment, and strong metal-support interaction, MSA materials often show distinct reactivity, selectivity, and stability from traditional metal nanomaterials. In the past decade, MSA materials have rapidly become the research frontier in catalysis, battery, sensing, and other fields. MSA materials not only provide a new solution for understanding the mechanism of reaction from atomic and molecular scales and studying the structure-activity relationship but also are expected to become a new family of functional materials with large-scale application potential. This Account highlights the recent advancements in the preparation and applications of MSAs in our group. The Account begins with a brief introduction to the structural properties of MSAs. After understanding the basic structural characteristics of MSAs, we summarize three common stabilization strategies for MSAs, including spatial confinement, coordination, and defect/vacancy design strategies. The controllable fabrication of stable and efficient MSAs is important for the investigation of the structure-performance relationship and a prerequisite for various applications. Some typical bottom-up and top-down strategies for the synthesis of MSAs are also briefly introduced. Furthermore, we review our recent advancements in the design and synthesis of MSAs and their applications, including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), photocatalytic H2 production, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, and the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Finally, the current challenges and our perspectives on the preparation and applications of advanced MSAs have been provided.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2643-6728		WOS:000875952500001

In this paper, CuCo2O4 catalysts with different micromorphologies are synthesized by using urea and ammonium fluoride, which can affect the nucleation ability of compounds. The OER catalytic performance of CuCo2O4/NF catalyst has been greatly improved with the synergistic effect of urea and ammonium fluoride.

However, few work was done to evaluate its accelerated life performance. The electrochemical properties and surface reaction mechanism of TinO2n-1/Ti were analyzed by the accelerated life test method. The result shows that the accelerated life cycle of the TinO2n-1/Ti electrode is about 320 h. The life cycle of it can be extended to 420 h by alternating the current direction. The failing reason of the TinO2n-1/Ti electrode is the exfoliation of the coating, which causes the passivation of the Ti substrate; consequently the cell voltage is increased, and as a result, the electrode fails.									2	3	0	0	0	0	4			1002-185X			WOS:000441099900019

First-principles calculations are performed to elucidate reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction to formic acid on Ni-based catalysts. The origin of CO poisoning is examined and a novel design strategy is proposed to eliminate CO poisoning. Three design criteria are derived based on which computational screening is performed to identify several Ni-based near-surface-alloys (NSAs) with both high selectivity and reactivity. The effect of elastic strain on CO2 reduction is studied on these NSAs. We predict that Ni/Ti, Cu/Ni, and strained Cu/Ni NSAs could lead to highly selective and efficient production of formic acid.									26	0	0	0	1	0	26			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000412150500035

In this research, OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction) catalyst has been developed improvement of durability. A modified polyol process is developed by controlling the pH of the solvent to synthesize the PtIr nanocatalysts on carbon supports. Each performance of the MEAs applying PtIr and Pt are equivalent because PtIrnanocatalysts have both ORR and OER activity.Breadboard test for catalyst durability in harsh conditions and high potentialsis found that the MEA applying PtIrnanocatalysts durability is improved more than the MEA applying Pt nanocatalysts									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1738-7264			KJD:ART002024215

We investigate the time evolution of the physical and chemical properties of a graphene oxide suspension as it transitions to a hydrogel. Fully formed hydrogels undergo densification during reaction, forming mechanically stable monoliths. We demonstrate that the gelation process removes oxygen functional groups, partially re-forms the sp(2) network, and creates bonds between graphene oxide sheets. Furthermore, these changes to the physical and chemical properties occur on exactly the same time scale, suggesting that they have a common origin. This discovery lends greater understanding to the formation of graphene oxide-based hydrogels, which could allow more flexibility and tunability in synthetic methods for graphene-like materials.									28	1	1	0	2	0	29			1932-7447			WOS:000346321700059

All the alcohols studied are dissociatively adsorbed as alkoxide by attacking the V-O bonds of the intralayer structure. Thermal desorption of alcohol occurs by one of, or a combination of, three processes (1) molecular desorption, (2) evolution of chemical species produced by catalytic reaction with the substrate such as methanal (methanol), ethene (ethanol), propene (propan-1-ol) etc., (3) decomposition by combustion with oxygen of the layer structure to produce CO2, CO and H2O, which are desorbed, and decomposition products such as polymerized species and/or carbides, which are deposited in the solid. The formation of the latter compounds delays the structural changes of the solid to form oxides of vanadium ions of lower valency (e.g. V4+ and V3+).									13	0	0	0	0	0	14			0956-5000			WOS:A1993MD73100028

In our present study, we found hydrogen peroxide formed during water splitting affect deleteriously the hydrogen evolution activity of catalyst due to the occupation of active sites on catalyst. Such a negative effect of hydrogen peroxide on hydrogen generation can be prohibited by introduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD), which is able to decompose the adsorbed hydrogen peroxide. The in-situ synthesized Sn4+ center over SnO photocatalyst can catalytically decompose hydrogen peroxide more efficiently than SOD, and as a result, Sn4+/SnO photocatalyst exhibited higher activity for over-all water splitting and better stability. By taking advantage of Sn4+ catalytic properties for hydrogen peroxide, the rate of H-2 evolution reached 18.3 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) and the corresponding AQE of 0.18% at 420nm over Sn4+/SnO catalyst under visible light irradiation without noble metal loading.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500015

The oxidation reaction was carried out under oxygen rich-conditions over the as prepared colloidal 4.9 wt.% Ru/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst and heated in H-2 at 500 degrees C for 15 h. The as prepared catalyst contained Ru nanoparticles with mean size of 1.6 nm and narrow size distribution, while hydrogen treated metal particles with mean size of 6 nm. Before examining catalytic properties, the Ru nanoparticles were subjected to heat treatment in oxygen atmosphere to study their microstructure evolution. HRTEM, SAED, XRD, BET, XPS, as well as hydrogen chemisorption and O-2 uptake techniques were applied to characterize the supported Ru nanoparticles. It was established that catalyst with the 1.6 nm Ru nanoparticles exhibited slightly higher specific activity than the catalyst with the 6 nm Ru nanoparticles. The superior catalytic performance of the Ru nanoparticles could be correlated with a high metallic dispersion and low particle sizes. It was evidenced that the most active sites in the propane oxidation reaction, consist small RuxOy clusters without well-defined stoichiometry. Such surface species were formed at 100-200 degrees C, and as a result the as prepared Ru/gamma-Al2O3 catalyst reached 100% propane conversion below 200 degrees C. Moreover, the Ru nanoparticles under oxidative atmosphere up to 250 degrees C, both in oxygen and in reaction of propane oxidation, possesses good stability and the ruthenium phase was not agglomerated. In consequence, recycling of the supported Ru nanoparticles results only in an insignificant loss of the catalytic activity. The very good catalytic performances of supported Ru nanoparticles prepared under microwave-polyol conditions, preserved after consecutive runs, make them promising for practical application in the purification of environmental pollutions.

The bimetallic Fe-Ni-based systems can exhibit a great potential for overall water splitting. However, its electrocatalytic mechanism remain elusive as a bifunctional catalyst. Herein, in acidic medium, HER and OER mechanisms on the (1 1 0) facet of pentlandite are systematically investigated by means of density functional theory. The results unravel that the bimetallic Fe-Ni heterostructure can delicately regulate the charge transfer to accommodate themselves separately to oxidation and reduction. The Fe site exhibits the excellent catalytic HER activity while the Ni site shows the high catalytic OER activity. Interestingly, during the OER process, the Fe site with *OH-poisonous adsorption can further optimize catalytic performance of its adjacent Ni site. These studies provide an in-depth understanding in the synergistic effect of Fe-Ni toward rational design and fabrication of efficient water splitting electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000860475400003

In present work, rod structured hierarchical cerium oxide/C derived from metal organic framework (MOF) electrocatalyst was synthesized via hydrothermal route directly grown on nickel foam (NF) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M KOH solution. The fabricated electrocatalysts were characterized via different analytical techniques to analyze the morphology, crystallinity and oxidation states. The electrochemical performances of the synthesized materials were investigated exhibiting outstanding OER performances, with low over potential of 297 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). The electrocatalyst also attains low Tafel slope (46 mV/dec) provides the way of electron transfer with long term stability (1000 cyclic voltammetry cycles and 15 h) chronoamperometry. These all results suggest that cerium oxide derived from MOF could be used as substitution for noble metal catalysts to develop promising, new and active electrocatalyst.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			0016-2361	1873-7153		WOS:000702826600008

Moreover, NO is an important intermediate within the currently imbalanced nitrogen cycle. Here, we study the electrochemical reduction of adsorbed NO on Pt(111) and Pt(100) electrodes by means of experimental and computational tools. Using linear sweep voltammetry, we find that the onset potentials on Pt(111) for the reduction of *NO on top and on fcc hollow sites (approximately +0.40 and +0.25 V-RHE, respectively) are independent of the surface coverage. On the other hand, *NO adsorbed at a low coverage on Pt(100) is more reactive than a compact, saturated *NO adlayer is, and the reaction kinetics switches from first- to second-order from high to low coverage. Density functional theory calculations offer an explanation for the experimental observations by suggesting that the stability of the first hydrogenation product (*NHO or *NOH) and thus the reaction mechanism strongly depends on the *NO coverage and the surface facet. Therefore, *NO reduction on platinum exemplifies a reaction in which not only the rate but also the mechanism is sensitive to structure and coverage. These observations hint at the need for a wider scope in materials design methodologies, as facet- and coverage-independent reaction pathways are typically used for materials screening.									64	1	0	0	2	0	64			2155-5435			WOS:000405360800056

However, current electrocarboxylation methods rely on the utilization of sacrificial metal anodes, which are not sustainable, require high voltages, and complicate the understanding of the reaction mechanism. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of performing electrocarboxylation reactions in divided cells with aqueous anolytes and nonsacrificial anodes, thereby eliminating the reliance on sacrificial anodes and opening the door for coupling of this important reduction process with various electrooxidation reactions requiring aqueous electrolytes. Specifically, we report a detailed study of electrocarboxylation of (1-bromoethyl)benzene at a silver cathode coupled with an oxygen evolution reaction at a platinum anode in a divided cell with organic and aqueous compartments separated by ion-exchange membranes of different types. We examine how operating parameters, including membrane type, applied potential, substrate concentration, electrolyte, and temperature affect the overall process and the reaction product distribution. Based on the extensive experimental results, we propose a detailed mechanism for major electrochemical product formation accounting for both aprotic and protic environments. Systematic analysis and mechanistic insights presented in this study are expected to enable a rational catalyst, electrolyte, and system design tailored to electroorganic CO2 fixation with different organic substrates to obtain industrially relevant carboxylic acids at practical potentials and currents.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			2168-0485			WOS:000503330400032

To optimize the economic viability of the electrolyzer, it is important that both electrochemical half reactions produce value-added chemicals. However, the achievement of high efficiency at both half-cells simultaneously is very difficult, because in addition to the design of suitable catalyst and electrolyte, the potentials at each electrode should meet the optimized condition. Herein, for the first time, we report a cathodic CO2RR integrated with an anodic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to form a brand-new paired electrolysis system. Using PdOx/ZIF-8 (a Zn-based metal organic framework) as cathode and PdO as anode, the established electrolyzer only required a 1.06 V onset cell voltage for the efficient conversion of both CO2 and HMF, in contrast to the 1.77 V for a conventional CO2RR-OER system. The CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) achieved 97.0% with a high current density of 103.5 mA.cm(-2) for CO2RR, and the organic acid yield reached 84.3% for HMFOR including 20.0% of maleic acid (MA) and 64.3% of formic acid (FA). This paired electrolysis system was outstanding in terms of FE and current density. This work opens new avenues for the efficient conversion of CO2 and biomass simultaneously.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2168-0485			WOS:000814204800001

Therefore, the reasonable design principle of catalyst, leading to high activity catalytic center and improving the accessibility of active sites, is undoubtedly crucial. Here, we used a kind of Prussian blue analogue (CoFe-PBA) nanoparticles to anchor the nitrogen-carbon doped CoFe2O4 (CoFe2O4@NC) species to reduced graphene oxide aerogels as OER catalysts. The strong interaction between nanosized CoFe2O4@NC and the graphitic carbon shell led to synergistic effects in the OER, and the protection of the carbon shell guaranteed stability of the catalyst. As a result, the aerogel electrocatalyst exhibits more excellent activity and stability than the most advanced RuO2 catalyst in OER under the same mass load in alkaline medium. It shows smaller overpotential of 250 mV to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in a continuous working time of more than 70 hours.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000685966000006

Cathodic behavior of TiO2 (anatase)-based electrodes observed in formaldehyde reaction integrates, in fact, several processes including hydrogen evolution, formaldehyde reduction, and proton insertion into anatase structure. The electrochemical activity of the anatase-based cathodes is, regardless of the surface orientation, dominated by proton insertion. The proton insertion is more pronounced on {001}-oriented anatase than on {101}-oriented nanocrystals due to anisotropy of the proton transport in the anatase which is more facile in the (001) direction. Aside from the proton insertion, both anatase orientations also differ in selectivity in the formaldehyde reduction. While {101} surface orientation produces primarily hydrogen and methanol, the same process on {001}-oriented surfaces shows the ability to produce aside of methanol also hydrocarbons most likely methane. The overall activity towards the reduction of organics is, however, lower than that of metals.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000521014100001

Purine Biosynthetic Intermediate-Containing Ribose-Phosphate Polymers as Evolutionary Precursors to RNA								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION				79	3-4			91	104		10.1007/s00239-014-9640-1				OCT 2014	2014	The RNA world hypothesis proposes that RNA once functioned as the principal genetic material and biological catalyst. However, RNA is a complex molecule made up of phosphate, ribose, and nucleobase moieties, and its evolution is unclear. Yakhnin has proposed a period of prebiotic chemical evolution prior to the advent of replication and Darwinian evolution, in which macromolecules containing polyols joined by phosphodiester linkages underwent spontaneous transesterification reactions with selection for stability. Although he proposes that the nucleobases were obtained during this stage from less stable macromolecules, the ultimate source of the nucleobases is not addressed. We propose that the purine nucleobases arose in situ from simpler precursors attached to a ribose-phosphate backbone, and that the weaker and less specific intra-and interstrand interactions between these precursors were the forerunners to the base pairing and base stacking interactions of the modern RNA nucleobases. Further, in line with Granick's hypothesis of biosynthetic pathways recapitulating evolution, we propose that these simpler precursors were the same or similar to intermediates of the modern de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. We propose that successive nucleobase precursors formed progressively stronger interactions that stabilized the ribose-phosphate polymer, and that the increased stability of the parent polymer drove the selection and further chemical evolution of the purine nucleobases. Such interactions may have included hydrogen bonding between ribose hydroxyls, hydrogen bonding between carbonyl oxygens and protonated amine side groups, the intra-and interstrand coordination of metal cations, and the stacking of imidazole rings. Five of the eleven steps of the modern de novo purine biosynthetic pathway have previously been shown to have alternative nonenzymatic syntheses, while a sixth step has also been proposed to occur nonenzymatically, supporting a prebiotic origin for the pathway.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0022-2844	1432-1432		WOS:000343292500002	25179142

First, following Paci et al. (J. Phys. Chem. A 2009, 113, 4677-4685), 5-eV energetic collisions of atomic oxygen with a 24-atom pristine graphene sheet and a sheet with a single vacancy defect, both functionalized with oxygen atoms in the form of epoxides, were studied. We found that the removal of an O(2) molecule from the surface of the graphene sheet occurs predominantly through an Eley-Rideal-type reaction mechanism. Our results, in terms of the number of occurrences of various reactive events, compared well with those reported by Paci et al. Subsequently, energetic collisions of atomic oxygen with a 25-times-expanded pristine sheet were investigated. The steady-state oxygen coverage was found to be more than one atom per three surface carbon atoms. Under an oxygen impact, the graphene sheet was always found to buckle along its diagonal. In addition, the larger sheet exhibited trampoline-like behavior, as a result of which we observed a much larger number of inelastic scattering events than those reported by Paci et al. for the smaller system. Removal of O(2) from the larger sheet occurred strictly through an Eley-Rideal-type reaction. Investigation of the events leading to the breakup of a pristine unfunctionalized graphene sheet and the effects of the presence of a second layer beneath the graphene sheet in an AB arrangement was done through successive impacts with energetic oxygen atoms on the structures. Breakup of a graphene sheet was found to occur in two stages: epoxide formation, followed by the creation and growth of defects. Events leading to the breakup of a two-layer graphene stack included epoxide formation, transformation from an AB to an AA arrangement as a result of interlayer bonding, defect formation and expansion in the top layer, and finally erosion of the bottom layer. We observed that the breakup of the two-layer stack occurred through a sequential, layer-by-layer, erosion process.									77	2	0	0	3	0	77			1089-5639			WOS:000297000600005	21942282

Particularly, samples were taken before calcium treatment (1 minute before the calcium addition) and at various times (typically 1 minute, 10 minutes and 30 minutes) after calcium treatment to study the transient inclusions evolution during calcium modification. Traditional modification mechanism of Al2O3 inclusions is that Al2O3 inclusion is directly modified by dissolved calcium or indirectly modified via CaO formed from calcium and oxygen. In the current study, after Ca-Si alloy power addition, CaS outer layer were promptly formed on the angular Al2O3 inclusion. With the reaction of the CaS outer layer and the Al2O3 core or [O], the Al2O3 inclusion was modified to a spherical liquid calcium aluminate. Moreover, the equilibrium curve of Ca-O and Ca-S, the stability diagram of inclusions and equilibrium precipitation of inclusions during solidification in linepipe steels were calculated to study the formation of inclusions.									67	8	1	0	0	0	71			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000347278400015

The starting reagent is a trivalent cobalt complex salt (Na3Co(NO2)(6)) which is decomposed in the presence of ammonium buffers. Precipitation begins from initially homogeneous solutions by separation of Co3O4-CoOOH mixtures. Upon heating, the latter compound progressively disappears transforming to Co3O4 by a phase change supported by Co(II) cations which also arise from the starting complex. The end spheres are initially formed by coagulation-aggregation of much finer particles, and are thereafter consolidated during the phase transformation and contain an extended system of interconnected micropores.

It is vital that single atoms are highly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst for them to contribute their activity. However, the number of highly dispersed single atoms on the surface is limited by the agglomeration at higher loading concentrations or by the small specific surface area of the catalyst. In this study, TiO2 nanoparticles modified with single Cu atoms were synthesized by hydrothermal method with a high specific surface area (158.23 m(2) g(-1)) and thus enhanced the exposure rate of single Cu atoms. The Cu-TiO2 exhibited a higher hydrogen evolution rate (21.053 mmol g(-1) h(-1)) than other TiO2-based photocatalysts in previous reports and showed good stability after a long-term catalysis test (the hydrogen evolution efficiency barely decreased in a 30 hour catalytic reaction and in a 84-day long-term catalytic test). Moreover, the optimized sample exhibits an apparent quantum efficiency of 13.61% at 365 nm. The study builds the foundation to design the advanced material for excellent photocatalytic activity as well as durability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000793978300001

Metamorphic devolatilization reactions occurring during slab burial play a key role in the transfer of elements to the supra-subduction mantle, from forearc to sub-arc depth. Here, we discuss the elements released in fluids and melts from oceanic (i.e., sediments, altered oceanic crust, and hydrated lithospheric mantle) and continental slab materials during prograde subduction and the consequent implications in the chemical evolution of the supra-subduction mantle. We use bulk data and fluid and melt inclusions analyses to show and to constrain the mobility of elements from top to bottom in the subduction zone setting. The development of melange domains at the slab-mantle interface and its influence in the element cycle are also taken into account. Coupled with trace-element mobility, we review the redox evolution of slab materials during subduction and its implication in the redox conditions of the supra-subduction mantle due to fluid and melt infiltration down to sub-arc depth.									26	2	0	0	2	0	27			1553-040X			WOS:000457106600002

Metabolic cold adaptation (MCA) predicts that populations or species from cooler environments will have either a higher metabolic rate at a common temperature or steeper MR-T relationships, indicating greater sensitivity of respiratory metabolism to temperature. Support for MCA has been found in some insect species by comparing species or populations differing in latitude. However, the generality of these findings are contentious, with most studies either unable to account for phenotypic plasticity or the evolutionary relatedness of species or populations. Hence, the importance of MCA is vigorously debated from both evolutionary and ecological perspectives. Furthermore, few species, particularly from tropical environments, have been shown to differ in MR-T sensitivity along altitudinal temperature gradients. Here, using four populations of tsetse flies (Glossina pallidipes, Diptera: Glossinidae) from thermally distinct geographic regions, we test the hypothesis that there is evolved variation in MR-T relationships to cold climates. We found that a high-altitude equatorial population from a cool habitat has a steeper MR-T reaction norm. By contrast, other populations from warmer environments in East Africa do not differ with respect to their MR-T reaction norms. Squared-change parsimony analyses, based on the combined mitochondrial 16S rDNA ribosomal subunit and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), support the hypothesis of adaptive differentiation of MR-T reaction norms in the cool-climate population. Seasonal adjustments or laboratory-temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity changed the intercept of the reaction norm rather than the slope, and thus the observed intraspecific variation in slopes of MR-T reaction norms could not be accounted for by phenotypic plasticity. These results therefore suggest evolutionary adaptation of MR-T reaction norms to cool climates (<22 degrees C) in tsetse and provide novel support for MCA within an insect species.									50	0	0	0	47	0	50			1522-2152	1537-5293		WOS:000269741700009	19624273

Herein, the synthesis of an unconventional nickel nitride nanostructure enriched with nitrogen vacancies (Ni3N1-x) through plasma-enhanced nitridation of commercial Ni foam (NF) is reported. The self-supported Ni3N1-x/NF electrode can deliver a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity competitive to commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline condition (i.e., an overpotential of 55 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 54 mV dec(-1)), which is much superior to the stoichiometric Ni3N, and is the best among all nitride-based HER electrocatalysts in alkaline media reported thus far. Based on theoretical calculations, it is further verified that the presence of nitrogen vacancies effectively enhances the adsorption of water molecules and ameliorates the adsorption-desorption behavior of intermediately adsorbed hydrogen, which leads to an advanced HER activity of Ni3N1-x/NF.									100	13	0	0	2	0	103			2198-3844			WOS:000441869400037	30128247

This state corresponds to a P-30(p, gamma) resonance at 517(4) keV, located below the higher edge of the Gamow window for peak nova temperatures of about 0.4 GK.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000809499200001

Several processes could be identified (dissociation of CO2 into CO(ads) and O(ads), disproportionation of CO(ads),, evolution of CO at T > 150-degrees-C, incorporation of oxygen into the sub-surface region at T > 100-degrees-C). Hydrogen can react very quickly with O(ads) and C(ads) and most probably assists the preliminary breaking of CO(ads). The latter process constitutes the slow step of the CO2 methanation.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0021-7689			WOS:A1993KK86500009

Here, different from previous design methodologies of pure-phase perovskites, we introduce soluble BaCl2 and SrCl2 into perovskites through a self-assembly process aimed at simultaneously tuning dual cation/anion leaching effects and optimizing ion match in perovskites to protect the crystalline matrix. As a proofof-concept, self-assembled hybrid Ba0.35Sr0.65Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta (BSCF) nanocomposite (with BaCl2 and SrCl2) exhibits the low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1M KOH. Multiple operando spectroscopic techniques reveal that the pre-leaching of soluble compounds lowers the difference of interfacial ion concentrations and thus endows the host phase in hybrid BSCF with abundant time and space to form stable edge/face-sharing surface structures. These self-optimized crystalline structures show stable lattice oxygen active sites and short reaction pathways between Co-Co/Fe metal active sites to trigger favorable adsorption of OH- species.									52	3	0	0	3	0	53			2041-1723			WOS:000550671200002	32632311

Here we report a self-standing MoC-Mo2C catalytic electrode prepared via a one-step electro-carbiding approach using CO2 as the feedstock. The outstanding HER performances of the MoC-Mo2C electrode with low overpotentials at 500 mA cm(-2) in both acidic (256 mV) and alkaline electrolytes (292 mV), long-lasting lifetime of over 2400 h (100 d), and high-temperature performance (70 C-o) are due to the self-standing hydrophilic porous surface, intrinsic mechanical strength and self-grown MoC (001)-Mo2C (101) heterojunctions that have a Delta G(H*) value of -0.13 eV in acidic condition, and the energy barrier of 1.15 eV for water dissociation in alkaline solution. The preparation of a large electrode (3 cm x 11.5 cm) demonstrates the possibility of scaling up this process to prepare various carbide electrodes with rationally designed structures, tunable compositions, and favorable properties.Scalable fabrication of Low-cost hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts that can operate at industry-relevant conditions is highly needed for efficient water electrolyzers.

The presence of TiO2 and Al2O3 was found to lower the concentrations of the intermediate catechol and TOC during irradiation whereas no effect was observed with Fe2O3. The various procedures applied in the work have demonstrated that phenol and its first intermediates were degraded by the products of water radiolysis. The TiO2 and Al2O3 nanoparticles behave only as adsorbant towards the catechol and other intermediates.

ZIF-8 was firstly carbonized in a nitrogen atmosphere, followed by pyrolysis in air forming carbon and zinc oxide hybrids. The hybrids were evaluated by photocatalytic dye degradation and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The contents of the dopants influenced the photocatalytic performances of the hybrids. The mechanism was illustrated and showed that hydroxyl radicals and photo-excited electrons contributed to the dye degradation. The carbon-zinc oxide hybrid also demonstrated a great potential for water oxidation because of the more active sites induced by dopants.									58	3	0	0	5	1	59				2046-2069		WOS:000385633100064

In this study, self -supported anticaustic three dimensional (3D) microcolumns anchored with trace Pt clusters on nickel foam (NF) is prepared through solvothermal followed by thermal reduction procedures (Pt-Co-Mo). The as-synthesized electrode owns superhydrophilic and aerophilic surface which favors close contact between the electrode and electrolyte and release of the generated hydrogen bubbles. Besides, the strong synergistic effect between Pt and matrix lead to a significantly improved HER intrinsic activity. Thanks to the above merits, the self-supported Pt-Co-Mo electrode presents outstanding HER activity, which only requires an extremely low overpotentials of 179.2 mV and 194.1 mV to reach a large current density of 2000 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH and 1 M KOH seawater, respectively.

However, in economical water-alkali electrolysers, sluggish water dissociation kinetics (Volmer step) on platinum-free electrocatalysts results in poor hydrogen-production activities. Here we report a MoNi4 electrocatalyst supported by MoO2 cuboids on nickel foam (MoNi4/MoO2@Ni), which is constructed by controlling the outward diffusion of nickel atoms on annealing precursor NiMoO4 cuboids on nickel foam. Experimental and theoretical results confirm that a rapid Tafel-step-decided hydrogen evolution proceeds on MoNi4 electrocatalyst. As a result, the MoNi4 electrocatalyst exhibits zero onset overpotential, an overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 30 mV per decade in 1M potassium hydroxide electrolyte, which are comparable to the results for platinum and superior to those for state-of-the-art platinum-free electrocatalysts. Benefiting from its scalable preparation and stability, the MoNi4 electrocatalyst is promising for practical water-alkali electrolysers.									632	34	0	0	32	2	639			2041-1723			WOS:000401513800001	28513620

The electrocatalytic properties of micro/nanostructured materials depend partially on the material's morphology type. Here, we describe the morphology-dependent electrocatalytic activities toward water electrooxidation, i.e., the oxygen evolution reaction, of micro-nanostructured MnOx films prepared by voltammetric deposition. Films were prepared under fixed deposition conditions using one of three water soluble Mn salt precursors: manganese nitrate (Mn(NO3)), manganese acetate (Mn(CH3COO)(2)), and manganese chloride (MnCl2). Each of the as-prepared MnOx films was heated at 400 A degrees C to tune the morphology, oxidation state of Mn and water electrooxidation efficiency. The as-prepared films lost significant amounts of their activity over several voltammetric water oxidation cycles. Heat treatment of the as-prepared films significantly improved the signal and stability of the water electrooxidation reaction. The water oxidation signal at 1.5 V, obtained using 400 A degrees C-heated micro-nanostructured MnOx films prepared from each of the three precursors, followed the order Mn(NO3)(2) > Mn(CH3COO)(2) > MnCl2. The reason of these different activities was due to their different morphologies as the same phase, E-Mn2O3, was found in the entire 400 A degrees C-treated MnOx films. The nanostructured MnOx film prepared from Mn(NO3)(2) was heated at different temperatures, and a temperature of 300 A degrees C was found to be optimal for water electrooxidation efficiency. The high resolution transmission electron microscopic image and X-ray photoelectron spectra revealed that the optimal MnOx was alpha-Mn3O4 phase, which might be a factor along with its special morphology for improving water oxidation reaction.									6	1	0	0	0	0	6			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000415054600019

However, the synthesis of oxysulfoselenides is challenging due to excessive particle growth and the limited availability of metal selenide precursors. In this study, a La5Ti2CuS5O7 (LTCSO) oxysulfide was annealed with Se powder in sealed, evacuated quartz tubes to obtain LTCSO:Se photocatalysts, and the properties of these materials were investigated. Se was found to be incorporated into the LTCSO upon heating at 973 K or higher, and the Se/(S + Se) ratio was increased to a maximum of 0.3 upon repeating the heat treatment twice. The addition of Se extended the absorption edge of the LTCSO and thus increased its photocatalytic H-2 evolution activity at longer wavelength. Even so, the apparent quantum yield at shorter wavelengths was reduced, which is similar to the results obtained for La5Ti2Cu(S1-xSe)(5)O-7(LTCS1-xSexO) solid solutions. Overall water splitting was achieved by constructing photocatalyst sheets using LTCSO:Se and LTCS1-xSexO as hydrogen evolution photocatalysts and BiVO4 as an oxygen evolution photocatalyst. Heat treatment with Se is evidently an effective method for the transformation of oxysulfide photocatalysts to oxysulfoselenides that promote photocatalytic H-2 evolution and have longer absorption edge wavelengths.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000459221900004	29771120

Recently, these 2D TMDs have attracted significant research interest because of the abundant choice of materials with diverse and tunable electronic, optical, chemical, and electrocatalytic properties. Although, the edges of the 2D TMDs show excellent electrocatalytic performance, their basal plane (001) is inert, which hinders their industrial applications for electrocatalysis. Transition metal/chalcogen atom vacancies or doping with some other foreign atoms may be a remedy to activate the inert basal plane. Here, we have computationally designed 2D monolayer MoSe2 and studied its electronic properties with electrocatalytic activities. A Pt-atom has been doped in the pristine 2D MoSe2 (i.e., Pt-MoSe2) to activate the inert basal plane resulting in a zero band gap. This study reveals that the Pt-MoSe2 is an excellent bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with the aid of first priciples-based hybrid density functional theory (DFT). The periodic hybrid DFT method has been applied to compute the electronic properties of both the pristine MoSe2 and Pt-MoSe2. To determine both the HER and ORR mechanisms on the surface of the Pt-MoSe2 material, non-periodic DFT calculation has been performed by considering a molecular Pt-1-Mo9Se21 cluster model. The present study shows that the 2D Pt-MoSe2 follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for the HER with energy barriers of about 9.29 kcal mol(-1) and 10.55 kcal mol(-1) during the H-migration and Heyrovsky reactions. The ORR is achieved by a four-electron transfer mechanism with the formation of two transition energy barriers of about 14.94 kcal mol(-1) and 11.10 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The lower energy barriers and high turnover frequency during the reactions expose that the Pt-MoSe2 can be adopted as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the HER and ORR. The present studies demonstrate that the exceptional HER and ORR activity and stability performance shown by the MoSe2 electrocatalyst can be enhanced by Pt-doping, opening a promising concept for the sensible design of high-performance catalysts for H-2 production and O-2 reduction.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000854262800001	36112072

Corrosion Control of Type 316L Stainless Steel in Sulfamic Acid Cleaning Solutions								CORROSION				65	7			491	500		10.5006/1.3319152				JUL 2009	2009	An investigation was conducted to better understand the corrosion behavior of Type 316L (UNS S31603) stainless steel in sulfamic acid (NH(2)HSO(3)) cleaning solutions and the relative merits of traditional corrosion control strategies. Gravimetric and electrochemical measurements in deaerated and uninhibited 10 wt% NH(2)HSO(3) at 65 degrees C revealed that corrosion proceeds in an active state and involves hydrogen evolution as the dominant cathodic process. Effective corrosion control attained through passivity can be attained through either anodic polarization or the addition of a chemical passivator (dissolved oxygen in this case). Upgrading to the more corrosion-resistant Type 2205 duplex stainless steel (UNS S32205) was not considered reliable because this alloy exhibited borderline passivity. Electrochemical and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) surface microanalytical measurements revealed that the effective corrosion control attained through the addition. of a commercial diethylthiourea-containing organic inhibitor was related to the manner in which the absorbed diethylthiourea, inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics.									5	1	0	0	0	0	5			0010-9312			WOS:000267836700007

In this work, a single-W-atom catalyst supported on metal-organic framework (MOF)-derived N-doped carbon (W-SAC) for efficient electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with high activity and excellent stability is reported. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis indicate the atomic dispersion of the W species, and reveal that the W1N1C3 moiety may be the favored local structure for the W species. The W-SAC exhibits a low overpotential of 85 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 53 mV dec(-1), in 0.1 m KOH solution. The HER activity of the W-SAC is almost equal to that of commercial Pt/C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the unique structure of the W1N1C3 moiety plays an important role in enhancing the HER performance. This work gives new insights into the investigation of efficient and practical W-based HER catalysts.									341	25	0	0	16	0	343			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000439737700008	29888491

Also, the cobalt phosphonate-based N-doped graphene oxide (CoImP/NGO) has shown the excellent OER activity due to the good conductive property, high surface area with proper microporous channel and the formation of electroactive CoOOH species on the surface of pore wall. In addition, CoImP/N-GO material displays the outstanding static current density up to 25 h time, suggesting the good stability of the material.

Accordingly, photocatalytic water splitting has drawn much attention as a key green technology of producing hydrogen. However, it has remained as a great challenge due to the low production rate and expensive constituents of photocatalytic systems. Herein, we synthesised nanostructures consisting of transition metal selenide and g-C3N4 for photocatalytic water splitting reaction. They include ZnSe, FeSe2, Zn/FeSe2 and ZnFeSe2 nanoflowers and a nanocomposite made of Zn/FeSe2 and g-C3N4. Hydrogen evolution rates in the presence of ZnSe, FeSe2, Zn/FeSe(2 )and ZnFeSe2 photocatalysts were measured as 60.03, 128.02, 155.11 and 83.59 mu molg(-1) min(-1), respectively. On the other hand, with the nanocomposite consisting of Zn/FeSe2 and g-C3N4, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates were significantly enhanced up to 202.94 mu mol g(-1) min(-1) and 90.92 mu mol g(-1 )min(-1), respectively. The nanocomposite was also examined as a photocatalyst for degradation of rhodamine B showing that it photodegrades the compound two times faster compared to pristine Zn/FeSe2 nanoflowers without g-C3N4. Our study suggests the nanocomposite of Zn/FeSe2 and g-C3N4 as a promising photocatalyst for energy and environmental applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-6535	1879-1298		WOS:000863316300009	35934097

However, common colloidal syntheses have restrictions that limit their applicability for industrial catalyst preparation. We present a simple, surfactant-free, and scalable preparation method for colloidal NPs to overcome these restrictions. We demonstrate how precious-metal NPs are prepared in alkaline methanol, how the particle size can be tuned, and how supported catalysts are obtained. The potential of these colloids in the preparation of improved catalysts is demonstrated by two examples from heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis.									31	0	0	0	0	0	31			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000444225100019

However, it usually suffers from extremely low ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency because of the lack of efficient electrocatalysts and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, we report that the semiconducting bismuth can be a promising catalyst for ambient electrocatalytic N-2 reduction reaction (NRR). A two-dimensional mosaic bismuth nanosheet (Bi NS) was fabricated via an in situ electrochemical reduction process and exhibited favorable average ammonia yield and Faradaic efficiency as high as 2.54 +/- 0.16 mu g(NH3) cm(-2) h(-1) (similar to 13.23 mu g mg(cat)(-1) h(-1)) and 10.46 +/- 1.45% at -0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M Na2SO4. The high NRR electrocatalytic activity of the Bi NS could be attributed to the sufficient exposure of edge sites coupled with effective p-orbital electron delocalization in the mosaic bismuth nanosheets. In addition, the semiconducting feature, which limits surface electron accessibility, could effectively enhance the Faradaic efficiency. This work highlights the potential importance of less reactive main group elements with tunable p-electron density, semiconducting property, and ingenious nanostructure for further exploration of N-2 reduction reaction electrocatalysts.									323	34	0	0	10	0	334			2155-5435			WOS:000464075700018

The purity of copper oxide obtained by this method greatly depends on the synthesis conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction duration, and hydroxyl ion concentration that assist the reduction kinetics. By optimizing the above parameters, cubic cuprous oxide with particle sizes controllable in the range of 10-30 nm were synthesized. The x-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the single-phased nature of Cu2O crystal. Furthermore, the ratio between copper and oxygen atoms in the product was determined to be 1.96 using the Rietveld analysis and confirmed the purity of Cu2O nanoparticles. In addition, I-V characteristics suggested that the nanoparticles function as semiconductor and indicated the use of these cuprous nanocrystals as a functional material for the preparation of solar devices.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2053-1591			WOS:000209665100033

Here, we show that the modification of n-Si MIS systems with CoFe Prussian blue (CoFePB) and NiRu Prussian blue (NiRuPB) analogues can modify their properties and allow a direct probing of the interfacial energetics through their redox feature. Our investigations demonstrate the importance of the preparation route and attribute the large upward photovoltage variation found in n-Si/SiOx/Ni/NiRuPB to the increasing inhomogeneity of the metal thin film. Finally, the optimal photoanode was tested for oxygen evolution and urea oxidation reactions. Our findings provide important insights on MIS photoanodes for future development in the field of solar fuel production.									7	0	0	0	0	0	6			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000595545800028

The growth and particle size of NizFe-PB-x-y can be adjusted by changing the ammonium persulfate concentration (x) and hydrothermal temperature (y). To explore the role of individual reactants, three other catalysts were synthesized by changing the reaction conditions, including sea urchin-like FeOOH, Fe-4[Fe(CN)(6)](3) cube, and NiFe PBA/FeOOH grain. During the reaction, ammonium persulfate may acted as a promoter and oxidant, sodium citrate as a reducing agent and morphological regulator, potassium ferricyanide as a single iron source, and nickel foam as a nickel source and substrate. More importantly, compared with other catalysts, the electrochemically activated Ni0.59Fe-PB-3-110 catalyst manifests the most outstanding catalytic activity in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte solution, with current densities of 50 and 800 mA cm(-2), requiring only 230 and 305 mV overpotential, respectively. It is anticipated that the novel strategy will not only contribute to the design and development of hierarchical three-dimensional PB or PBAs supported by conductive substrates, but also further promote their applications in the field of electrocatalysis and energy storage.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691195700007

The results of GaN growth by adding different purity graphite indicate that graphite with higher purity is better than lower purity ones at suppressing polycrystal generation. Furthermore, by comparing the different types of carbon, it is found that the suppression effect increases in the following order: carbon nanotubes, active carbon, graphene, graphite, and ordered mesoporous carbon, accompanied by the evolution of morphology. First-principles calculation and specific surface area measurement show that the C-N bond energy in carbon plays a key role in suppressing the polycrystals, rather than the specific surface area of carbon. A mechanism of C-N bonding in Na-Ga melts has been proposed to illustrate the difference in suppressing polycrystal generation and morphology evolution.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1466-8033			WOS:000348214600009

The structural morphologies were found to vary with the reaction time, calcination temperature and dosage of urea and the urea was verified to play an important role in the determination of the CeO2-ZrO2 composite nanostructures. The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and other techniques. On the basis of the characterizations, it was proven that there existed migrations or movements during the hydrothermal process especially with long hydrothermal time and a possible mechanism was proposed which would go through a series of procedures of nucleation, Ostwald ripening and Kirkendall effect to account for the structural dynamics and morphological evolutions. Subsequently, the hybrid Ce0.9Zr0.1O2-GO was reduced by a hydrothermal method, which showed good adsorption for RhB.									11	1	0	0	0	0	12				2046-2069		WOS:000364047900071

Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) is a highly attractive approach to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and selectivity with solar energy. LSPR excitation can induce the transfer of hot electrons and holes, electromagnetic field enhancement, lattice heating, resonant energy transfer and scattering, in turn boosting a variety of electrocatalytic reactions. Although the LSPR-mediated electrocatalysis has been investigated, the underlying mechanism has not been well explained. Moreover, the efficiency is strongly dependent on the structure and composition of plasmonic metals. In this review, the currently proposed mechanisms for plasmon-mediated electrocatalysis are introduced and the preparation methods to design supported plasmonic nanostructures and related electrodes are summarized. In addition, we focus on the characterization strategies used for verifying and differentiating LSPR mechanisms involved at the electrochemical interface. Following that are highlights of representative examples of direct plasmonic metal-driven and indirect plasmon-enhanced electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, this review concludes with a discussion on the remaining challenges and future opportunities for coupling LSPR with electrocatalysis.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000696597200001	34533143

However, slow kinetics is a problem in this process, so the quantitative analysis of kinetic parameters is necessary to design film-type electrocatalysts. Although electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been proven to be a powerful tool in analyzing sparsely loaded catalysts on electrically conducting supporters, it turned out that film-type catalysts above 100 nm thickness are challenging to analyze with conventional models. Here, we propose a new transmission line model that was implemented with a Havriliak-Negami (H-N) capacitor and Warburg element. We successfully extracted meaningful kinetic parameters, such as the reaction rate constant at active sites and transport parameters across the film. We utilized this model to analyze monodisperse sub-10 nm partially oxidized MnO nanoparticles (p-MnO NPs) operating with superb activity under neutral pH. From this analysis, we revealed that protons are involved in transport on the surface of p-MnO NPs, explained the rationale for the optimum thickness, and correlated the reaction rate constant (22.1 s(-1) for a 300 nm-thick film at 1.35 V vs NHE) with the kinetic parameters obtained from electrokinetic analysis.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2168-0485			WOS:000472240900047

Phase evolution of LiAl5-xZnxO8-0.5x was determined by XRD analysis. The XRD results indicated that the phase compositions had a P4(3)32 space group when 0 <= x <= 0.2 and a spinel structure when 0.3 <= x <= 0.5. The dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) of this series' solid solutions decreased with the increase in Zn doping content, which was in good agreement with the Clausius-Mossotti relation. Oxygen vacancy and the decreased degree of order degraded the quality factor (Q x f) of the two structures. The deterioration in quality factor was further verified by impedance spectroscopy. The temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency (tau(f)) decreased with the increase in x and was correlated with the unit cell volume. Finally, CaTiO3 was used as a compensation material to obtain a near-zero tau(f) of the LiAl5O8 ceramic.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000486945800001

By etching the obtained MoS2@CNT into 10% wt HNO3, the morphology of MoS2 decorated on CNT bundles was modulated, resulting in more catalytic active MoS2 edges being exposed for significantly enhanced electrochemical performance. Our results revealed that an 8 h acid etching sample exhibited the best performance for the oxygen evolution reaction, i.e., the current density reached 10 mA/cm(2) under 375 mV over-potential, and the tafel slope was as low as 94 mV/dec. The enhanced behavior was mainly originated from the more catalytic sites in MoS2 induced by the acid etching treatment and the higher conductivity from the supporting CNT films. Our study provides a new route to produce two-dimensional layers on CNT films with tunable morphology, and thus may open a window for exploring its promising applications in the fields of catalytic-, electronic-, and electrochemical-related fields.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1420-3049			WOS:000389917900055

Plain Ir possesses optimum performance for OER in alkaline electrolytes but presents a noticeable underperforming HER activity. Herein, the strategy by pyrolyzing Ir-modified metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) precursors has been employed in designing electrocatalysts consisting of IrFe nanoalloys supported on N-doped carbon layers. The catalyst requires a small overpotential of 105 mV to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in basic media, which surpasses that of commercial Ir/C and Pt/C benchmarks. Particularly, the catalyst also exhibits an extraordinary performance with low overpotential of only 850 mV at 1000 mA cm(-2). The extraordinary performance originates from superior conductivity, the modulated electronic structure and large specific surface area.									32	2	0	0	4	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000487570000023

We herein design and synthesise nanocomposites of metallic cobalt and molybdenum nitride on a nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (Co-Mo2N@ NC). The electrocatalyst exhibits extraordinary HER performance with an overpotential of only 47 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm 2 and Tafel slope of 43 mV dec 1 in a 1 M KOH solution, which is comparable to that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (43 mV at 10 mA cm 2). At high current density it even exhibits better performance than Pt/C (170 mV vs. 220mV at 100mAcm 2). The excellent activity stems fromthe roles of Co nanoparticles in improving electrical conductivity, optimizing the electronic structure and thus speeding up hydrogen desorption from Mo2N, and of the in situ formed Co(OH) 2 in boosting water dissociation. Therefore, this work provides a low-cost potential electrocatalyst to replace Pt/C.									27	7	0	0	1	0	28			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000488618600009

Cavity-microelectrodes can be filled with a desired finely dispersed material thus compensating for the limited commercial availability of microwires. After discussing the possibility of filling and emptying a cavity-microelectrode with a desired tip shape, the consistency of negative and positive feedback approach curves obtained after filling a Au C-ME was verified. In addition, the tip/C-ME was tested under gas (oxygen) evolution condition, in order to demonstrate that the filling is stable in a wide range of gas fluxes thus extending the possible applications to tip generation/substrate collection mode. Finally, we introduce the use of the proposed system to quantify the rates of parallel reactions occurring at the material inserted in the tip under the tip generation/substrate collection mode.

This catalytic electrode when screened for methanol oxidation electrocatalysis in 1 M KOH with 0.5 M methanol, delivered a current density as high as 70 +/- 10 mA cm(-2) at 0.65 V versus Hg/HgO which is superior to the performance of many related catalysts reported earlier. The observed activity enhancement is attributed to the formation of both Cu(OH)(2)-CuO nanoneedle arrays of high active surface area over the metallic Cu foil. In addition, the Cu(OH)(2)-CuO/Cu electrode had also exhibited excellent stability upon prolonged potentiostatic electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol while retaining the charge-transfer characteristics. Growth of such highly ordered assembly of Cu(OH)(2)-CuO nanoneedles within a minute has never been achieved before. When compared to its oxygen evolution reaction activity, the addition of 0.5 M methanol has lowered the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) by 334 mV, which is significant. This encourages the use of methanol as a sacrificial anolyte for energy-saving production of H-2 from water electrolysis.									53	2	0	0	3	0	54			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000542925300055	32459085

X-ray diffraction analysis reveals evolution of new phases - namely, gamma-alumina and non-stoichiometric phases of alumina. Reinforcement of 3 wt% MWNTs has been shown to restrict the degeneration of ceria and synergistically conserve the gamma-phase. The catalytic ability of alumina-micro-ceria-MWNT has been confirmed from the nitric oxide (NO) oxidation reaction. An observed 25% conversion ability arises at 350 degrees C in a 10% oxygen (O-2) environment, which indicates that ceria inclusion increases the oxidation of nitric oxide. Thus, the alumina-micro-ceria-MWNT composite can serve as a potential catalyst for nitric oxide conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-9831	2045-984X		WOS:000405384600005

Pt@NOMC-A exhibits a low HER overpotential comparable with commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst under acidic, neutral and alkaline condition. Furthermore, Pt@NOMC-A shows a superior electrochemical stability under working conditions suppressing that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been employed to characterize the morphology and composition of CNFs and NCNFs. Compared with CNFs, NCNFs display thinner diameter, rougher surface and higher content of pyrrolic-N. As a metal-free catalyst for ORR, NCNFs exhibit comparable catalytic activity, significantly enhanced long-time stability and selectivity in comparison with commercial available Pt/C catalyst. Importantly, the self-supported NCNFs films could be conveniently utilized for electrode modification which is attractive in fuel cells.

Herein, we present a facile hydrothermal and selenization treatment to fabricate cobalt selenide nanosheets on nickel foam (0.1-CoSe2/NF) as a bifunctional catalyst for plastic-electroreforming assisted water electrolysis. Benefiting from its large specific surface area, abundant active sites, high conductivity and 3D porous structure, 0.1-CoSe2/NF exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance and durability for both the HER and electrooxidation of plastic waste polylactic acid (PLA). Overpotentials of 202 mV (cathodic) and 288 mV (anodic) are observed at a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline electrolyte. Moreover, PLA oxidation that suppresses the OER also addresses the safety concern of gas crossover in water electrolysis. Our work thus provides a promising pathway for low-cost, high efficiency, and stable production of green hydrogen assisted by electroreforming of plastic waste.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000848121900001

Herein, we rationally designed and fabricated a self-supported F-anion-doped Ni3S2 nanosheet array grown on Ni foam (F-Ni3S2/NF) with enhanced HER performance in alkaline media. The obtained catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 38 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 78 mV dec(-1) and can sustain for 30 h, which is comparable to commercial Pt/C catalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure, and density functional theory analysis simultaneously demonstrate the successful modulation of the electronic structure of Ni3S2 by substitutional F doping. This work not only provides atomic-level insight into adjusting the electronic structure of metal sulfides through anion engineering but also opens an avenue for reasonable design of advanced earth-abundant electrocatalysts toward HER and beyond.									95	7	0	0	6	0	95			2380-8195			WOS:000503114500018

The iR-free HER performance as a function of solute concentration was found to exhibit a volcano-shaped trend in sodium phosphate solution at pH 5, with the maximum occurring at 2 M. A detailed microkinetic model that includes calculated activity coefficients, solution resistance, and mass-transport parameters accurately describes the measured values, clarifying that the overall HER performance is predominantly governed by mass-transport of slow phosphate ions (weak acid). In the HER at the optimum concentration of approximately 2 M sodium phosphate at pH 5, our theoretical model predicts that the concentration overpotential accounts for more than half of the required overpotential. The substantial concentration overpotential would originate from the electrolyte property, suggesting that the proper electrolyte engineering will result in an improved apparent HER performances. The significance of concentration overpotential shown in the study is critical in the advancement of electrocatalysis, biocatalysis, and photocatalysis.									53	1	0	0	4	0	53			1932-7447			WOS:000360947800026

However, the development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts remains a huge challenge. In this study, a novel coordination confinement pyrolysis method was demonstrated to construct an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst with inherited hierarchical flower-like morphology, in which the ultra-small CoP nanoparticles with ca. 4 nm in size were successfully embedded into the nanosheet assembly unit. The resulted catalyst product with a unique three-dimensional structure not only realizes the satisfying catalytic efficiencies with overpotentials of 143 and 298 mV for HER and OER at the current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), but also delivers suitable stability after long-term electrolytic process. Therefore, this catalyst design concept integrating ultra-small nanoparticles, ultra-thin nanosheets, and three-dimensional assembly could provide a novel idea to evolve the other heterogeneous catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000724788700002

Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that cyanogroup functionalization can effectively reduce the d-band centre (epsilon(d)) of the Pt (111) plane, thus resulting in a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance improvement. Cyanogroup functionalized Pt ultrafine nanonetworks (CN-Pt UNs, sub-2 nm) are synthesized via a facile one-pot heating method with high yield and abundant defects/grain boundaries as the highly active sites. Owing to the optimized Pt electronic properties and ultrathin network nanostructure, the overpotentials of CN-Pt UNs at 10 mA cm(-2) are merely 6 mV and 8 mV in 1 M HClO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively, and are superior to those of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C in a wide pH range. This work offers a new perspective towards the rational design of noble metal catalysts for boosting electrocatalysis by surface cyanogroup functionalization.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1466-8033		WOS:000678737000001		
J	Hiraki, M; van Rensen, JJS; Vredenberg, WJ; Wakabayashi, K								Characterization of the alterations of the chlorophyll a fluorescence induction curve after addition of Photosystem II inhibiting herbicides								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				78	1			35	46		10.1023/A:1026038617618				2003	2003	The effects of Photosystem II inhibiting herbicides, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (diuron), atrazine and two novel 2-benzylamino-1,3,5-triazine compounds, on photosynthetic oxygen evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence induction were measured in thylakoids isolated from Chenopodium album (wild type and atrazine-resistant plants) and cyanobacterial intact cells. The resistant plants have a mutation of serine for glycine at position 264 of the D1 protein. Diuron and two members of a novel class of 2-benzylamino-1,3,5-triazine compounds were almost as active in wild-type as in atrazine-resistant thylakoids, indicating that the benzylamino substitution in the novel triazines may be important for the lack of resistance in these atrazine-resistant plants. The inhibition by the herbicides of oxygen evolution in the cyanobacteria was somewhat lower than in the thylakoids of Chenopodium album wild type, probably caused by a slower uptake in the intact cells. The so-called OJIP fluorescence induction curve was measured during a one second light pulse in the absence and in the presence of high concentrations of the four herbicides. In the presence of a herbicide we observed an increase of the initial fluorescence at the origin (Fo'), a higher J level, and a decreased steady state at its P level (Fp). The increase to Fo' and the decreased leveling Fp are discussed. After dark adaptation about 25% of the reaction centers are in the S-0 state of the oxygen evolving complex with an electron on the secondary electron accepting quinone, Q(B). The addition of a herbicide causes a transfer of the electron on Q(B) to the primary quinone acceptor, Q(A), and displacement of Q(B) by the herbicide; the reduced Q(A) leads to a higher Fo'. The decrease of Fp in the presence of the herbicides is suggested to be caused by inhibition of the photo-electrochemical stimulation of the fluorescence yield.									29	2	1	0	29	2	33			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000185798100003	16245062

The apparatus was constructed with inherent safety features and is compatible with different types of catalysts, catalyst and peroxide concentrations, and reaction temperatures to enable the design Of various experiments. The hands-on outreach activity was created with the aim of building scientific proficiency and stimulating interest in STEM fields among students with limited chemistry background. This activity is designed to be completed in short times (45 min) by students in small groups (3-5 students), where each group measures reaction rates at various activity stations and then gathers as a larger group (similar to 20 total) to discuss their observations and results and to assess their scientific understanding. Additionally, the activity is incorporated into a broader outreach program that uses hydrogen peroxide reactions as an underlying theme to introduce fundamental concepts in catalysis and kinetics to K-12 students.

Meanwhile, the nanosheets were oxygen sufficient based on the electron energy loss spectroscopy. The mechanism associated with formation of the hexagonal nanopores was discussed according to structural evolution.

Nickel-copper phosphides have attracted interest as synergistic components with superior electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report on branched heterostructures of nickel-copper phosphides (CuNi/P) grown on a 3D nickel foam (NF) substrate that were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal method and subsequent low-temperature phosphidization. These unique, branched heterostructures exhibited a strong synergetic effect between various metallic phosphides, and provided more active sites and improved the material's electronic conductivity to produce a higher charge transfer rate. Consequently, the synthesized CuNi/P possessed superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 99 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm(2), and a low Tafel slope of 79 mV/decade for hydrogen evolution in alkaline solution. In addition, this electrocatalyst exhibited electrochemical resilience for at least 10 h, which was a good indication of its possible application for large-term water electrolysis. This reported strategy may provide a path for the development of other bimetallic phosphide materials with superior catalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000539629600004

Herein, under the guidance of theoretical calculations, a new type of skutterudite-type ternary cobalt nickel phosphide (Co1-x Ni-x P-3) nanoneedle arrays (NAs) is fabricated on carbon cloth for the splitting of water. The electronic structure was tuned by doping an appropriate amount of Ni, and the resultant Co0.93Ni0.07P3 displayed good catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with an overpotential (eta(10)) of 87 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) when the current density reaches -10 mA cm(-2) and the Tafel slope of the catalyst is 60.7 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. In addition, the Co0.93Ni0.07P3 also exhibited an OER activity (eta(20) of 221 mV vs RHE and the Tafel slope of 83.7 mV dec(-1)).

However, fast charge recombination caused intrinsically by the pi-pi conjugated electronic system severely limits its photocatalytic performance. Constructing carbon nitride photocatalysts with modulated electronic structures is thus a promising but challenging task. In this paper, carbon nitride with different microstructural features, such as degree of polymerization, hydrogen bonds, bandgap, structural defects and ratio of C/N, were synthesized by polymerization of different types of nitrogen-rich precursors. Synergetic reactions were rationally designed for hydrogen production and the efficient and simultaneous removal of multiple contaminants, using carbon nitrides as metal-free photocatalysts. The significant impact of hydrogen bonds on synergetic photocatalysis was comprehensively demonstrated. With the smallest amount of hydrogen bonds, carbon nitride derived from urea exhibited fast charge transfer between interlayers, which is a prerequisite for superior photoactivity. By contrast, the polymerization of melamine and cyanamide was favorable for the formation of abundant hydrogen bonds and intrinsic vacancy defects. It was found that the coexistence of nitrogen deficiency and oxygen-doped microstructures could facilitate the activation of oxygen molecules, and thereby contributed to their moderate photoactivity. This research provides fundamental insights into the microstructural engineering of carbon nitride for high-performance synergetic applications.

Herein, a ZIF-67-derived La-doped CoP (La-CoP) is prepared by a facile solvothermal-phosphorization process as an efficient bifunctional water-splitting catalyst. The introduction of La into CoP enables the modulation of the electronic configuration of Co and P, facilitating the charge transfer and thus lowering the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step to catalyze oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The optimized La-CoP delivers good OER and HER activities as manifested by small overpotentials of 270 and 109 mV, respectively, to reach the current density of 10 mA cm(-2). The electrolyzer constructed using La-CoP as both cathode and anode requires a cell voltage of 1.608 V at 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media, which outperforms a noble metal-based (Pt/C and RuO2) electrolyzer.

Here, the aforementioned restrictions could be simultaneously alleviated by coupling ultrathin black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets, taking the monoclinic WO3 nanoflake array as a prototype. Derived from the unequal work functions, a large built-in electric field was formed, and the surface hole extraction efficiency was improved from 41.7 to 70.9% at 1.23 V. The efficient carrier exchange, in turn, inhibited self-oxidation of the exfoliated BP nanosheets and resulted in fine durability during the 12 h of stability testing. Moreover, density functional theory calculations revealed that coordinatively unsaturated phosphorus atoms intensified affinity to O species intermediates and lowered the activation energy, thereby reducing the OER overpotential. Consequently, a low onset potential of 0.21 V and a high photocurrent density of 1.88 mA cm(-2) were achieved. This work paves a way to rationally design the harmonious coexistence of BP-based electrocatalysts and photoanodes to achieve enhanced solar energy conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000791978500001

The direct pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) materials has been widely adopted to prepare metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) catalysts for the ORR, but they suffer from structure collapse and reduced active sites. Herein, for the first time, a novel F127-assisted ZIF-67 (ZIF-67-F127) pyrolysis strategy to construct FeCo nanoalloys encapsulated in nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalysts FexCo@NC-F127 (x represents the molar ratio of Fe to Co) was reported. The introduction of F127 into ZIF-67 endowed Fe0.5Co@NC-F127 with a high surface area, rich mesopores, and a defective structure, thus favoring the dispersion of active sites, mass transfer and electron transport, and electronic structural regulation of M-N sites as compared to the F127-free counterpart (Fe0.5Co@NC). As a result, the Fe0.5Co@NC-F127 catalyst exhibited higher electrocatalytic activity for the ORR than Fe0.5Co@NC and single metal counterparts, which was comparable to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Our catalyst was demonstrated to have long-term durability and methanol-tolerance properties, which made it promising for large-scale applications. Our work provides a novel and facile strategy to fabricate platinum-free and efficient ORR catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000777729700001

On the other hand, the development of low-cost and efficient catalysts based on earth-abundant elements for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has remained elusive. Herein, a robust nonprecious metal-based electrocatalyst is demonstrated, consisting of nitrogen-doped carbon hollow spheres elaborately decorated with Co3O4 nanoparticles (HCN-Co3O4). The unique structure of HCNCo3O4 fully enables the utilization of synergistic effect of the high activity of Co3O4 and the excellent conductivity of HCN, endowing the hybrid with an excellent ORR catalytic activity in MFCs. Benefiting from intriguing structural features, HCN-Co3O4 exhibits a significantly enhanced electrocatalytical performance towards the ORR both in alkaline and neutral conditions, superior cycling stability, and outstanding durability compared to pure Co3O4 and hollow Co3O4 (H-Co3O4) spheres. Moreover, the high power density of the self-assembled MFCs equipped with the HCN-Co3O4 cathode also indicates the feasibility of the catalyst for practical applications.									31	2	0	0	7	0	33			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000398671400006

Using either classical powder electrodes or a cavity microelectrode we show that cyclic voltammetry peaks coming from the hydrogen sorption/evolution, that are usually strongly overlapped in powder electrodes, can be resolved at low scan rates. With the cavity microelectrode, we could measure voltammograms over a 3-decade range of potential scan rates and thus describe the sorption processes in this hybrid material. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we use the oxygen anomaly of nitrate (Delta O-17(NO3-)) in high-time-resolved (3 h) aerosols to explore the chemical mechanisms of nitrate evolution in fine particles during the winter in Nanjing, a megacity of China. The continuous Delta O-17(NO3-) observation suggested the dominance of nocturnal chemistry (NO3 + HC/H2O and N2O5 + H2O/Cl-) in nitrate formation in the wintertime. Significant diurnal variations of nitrate formation pathways were found. The contribution of nocturnal chemistry increased at night and peaked (72%) at midnight. Particularly, nocturnal pathways became more important for the formation of nitrate in the process of air pollution aggravation. In contrast, the contribution of daytime chemistry (NO2 + OH/H2O) increased with the sunrise and showed a highest fraction (48%) around noon. The hydrolysis of N2O5 on particle surfaces played an important role in the daytime nitrate production on haze days. In addition, the reaction of NO2 with OH radicals was found to dominate the nitrate production after nitrate chemistry was reset by the precipitation events. These results suggest the importance of high-time-resolved observations of Delta O-17(NO3-) for exploring dynamic variations in reactive nitrogen chemistry.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2397-3722			WOS:000814262400003

K.; Jones, Michael R.; van Grondelle, Rienk								Photoprotection through ultrafast charge recombination in photochemical reaction centres under oxidizing conditions								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				372	1730					20160378	10.1098/rstb.2016.0378				SEP 26 2017	2017	Engineering natural photosynthesis to address predicted shortfalls in food and energy supply requires a detailed understanding of its molecular basis and the intrinsic photoprotective mechanisms that operate under fluctuating environmental conditions. Long-lived triplet or singlet excited electronic states have the potential to cause photodamage, particularly in the presence of oxygen, and so a variety of mechanisms exist to prevent formation of such states or safely dissipate their energy. Here, we report a dramatic difference in spectral evolution in fully reduced and partially oxidized Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centres (RCs) following excitation of the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) cofactors at 805 nm. Three types of preparation were studied, including RCs purified as protein/lipid nanodiscs using the copolymer styrene maleic acid. In fully reduced RCs such excitation produces membrane-spanning charge separation. In preparations of partially oxidized RCs the spectroscopic signature of this charge separation is replaced by that of an energy dissipation process, including in the majority sub-population of reduced RCs. This process, which appears to take place on both cofactor branches, involves formation of a BChl(+)/bacteriopheophytin(-) radical pair that dissipates energy via recombination to a vibrationally hot ground state. The possible physiological role of this dissipative process under mildly oxidizing conditions is considered.This article is part of the themed issue 'Enhancing photosynthesis in crop plants: targets for improvement'.									4	0	0	0	3	0	4			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000407717300004	28808097

Loading cocatalysts on semiconductors is proved to be an effective approach to promote the charge separation and transfer, suppress the charge recombination and enhance the photocatalytic activity. Furthermore, the photocatalytic performance can be significantly improved by loading dual cocatalysts for reduction and oxidation, which could lower the activation energy barriers, respectively, for the two half reactions. A quantum efficiency (QE) as high as 93 per cent at 420nm for H-2 production has been achieved for Pt-PdS/CdS, where Pt and PdS, respectively, act as reduction and oxidation cocatalysts and CdS as a photo-harvester. The dual cocatalysts work synergistically and enhance the photocatalytic reaction rate, which is determined by the slower one (either reduction or oxidation). This work demonstrates that the cocatalysts, especially the dual cocatalysts for reduction and oxidation, are crucial and even absolutely necessary for achieving high QEs in photocatalytic hydrogen production, as well as in photocatalytic water splitting.									36	1	0	0	0	0	36			1364-503X	1471-2962		WOS:000321115700005	23816907

Various techniques including laser photolysis and electron paramagnetic resonance were combined to disentangle the underlying photocatalytic mechanism, which suggested that, unlike nano semiconducting catalysis, the multivalent Co metal center of the polymer mediated the electron transfer process, directly got involved in the proton reduction by sequentially exchanging electrons in a way similar to those molecular coordinated catalysts. These findings provide useful insight into the photocatalytic mechanism of the metal center-mediated water splitting process, and the employment of an economical non-noble metal-coordinated polymer as highly efficient catalyst may open a new avenue for long-term conversion of sunlight into sustainable hydrogen energy.									10	0	0	0	4	0	10			1932-7447			WOS:000390735600010

In this article, ultrathin Pd nanosheets are integrated with semiconductor TiO2 nanosheets for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, which acts as a cocatalyst and plasmonic agent in ultraviolet and visible-near-infrared spectral regions, respectively. Owing to the unique two-dimensional (2D) nanostructure, the Pd nanosheet cocatalyst realizes the large TiO2-Pd interfacial area for electron transfer as well as a large Pd exposed area for reduction reactions, while the plasmonic Pd nanosheets offer strong vis-NIR light absorption for "hot" electron production as well as a large interfacial area for "hot" electron injection. As a result, the Pd nanosheets achieve improved photocatalytic activity in comparison with three-dimensional Pd nanotetrahedrons under both light irradiations. This work underlines the importance in choosing a suitable shape of metal in the surface and interface design of semiconductor-metal hybrid photocatalysts as well as the advantages of 2D metal nanostructures in realizing high photocatalytic performance.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17				2046-2069		WOS:000378755200008

Thus, the ability to cathodically protect long, tight crevices and cracks is explained on the basis of depletion of oxygen but also on the slower kinetics for hydrogen generation consequent upon the locally elevated pH. The conditions for developing locally acidic conditions in cracks are described and used to rationalize the "chemical short crack effect" in corrosion fatigue. It is then shown how the relative magnitude of the kinetics of hydrogen generation at the crack tip and on the surface external to the crack need to be considered in testing for resistance to hydrogen-assisted cracking. The importance of internal reactions in the context of boiling water reactor crack chemistry is highlighted, and finally, ideas about constraining crevice attack by increasing the local hydrogen evolution kinetics are explored.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000277580200001

To directly observe the surface property changes accompanying the activity change, we characterized the samples coated on the glassy carbon after cyclic voltammetry measurements and applied different types of re-doping process. Based on the electrochemical measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the active site of the oxygen reduction reaction in HA-N900 is unlikely to be the pyridinic nitrogen or the carbon atom neighboring the pyridinic nitrogen. Instead, the active site appears to be the Nx-Fe site established by Fe impurities in the carbon nanotubes. (C) 2019 The Electrochemical Society.

The gas effect on the plume dynamics was studied for 02 pressures varied between 10(-2) to 70 mbar. Plasma plume evolution was investigated by ICCD camera fast imaging. The plasma was created by a KrF excimer laser (lambda = 248 mn, tau = 25 ns) at a fluence of 2 J/cm(2).The light emitted by the plume was observed along the perpendicular to the ejection direction through a fast intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD). We have found that the plasma dynamics is very affected by the gas pressures. The photographs reveal the stratification of plasma into slow and fast components for 0.5 mbar O-2 pressures and beyond. The photographs also show the apparition of hydrodynamic instabilities which are related to chemical reactions between the plasma and the surrounding gas for a certain range of pressures.					1st International Conference on Laser and Plasma Applications in Materials Science1st International Conference on Laser and Plasma Applications in Materials Science	JUN 23-26, 2008JUN 23-26, 2008	Adv Technol Dev Ctr; Minist Higher Educ & Sci Res; Natl Oil & Gas Co; Natl Elect & Gas Distribut Co; Commiss Atomic Energy; Univ Res Dev, Natl Agecy; French Solid Lasers Mfg Quantel; Embassy France Algeria; African Laser Ctr; African Laser Atomic, Mole & Opt Sci LAM NetwrokAdv Technol Dev Ctr; Minist Higher Educ & Sci Res; Natl Oil & Gas Co; Natl Elect & Gas Distribut Co; Commiss Atomic Energy; Univ Res Dev, Natl Agecy; French Solid Lasers Mfg Quantel; Embassy France Algeria; African Laser Ctr; African Laser Atomic, Mole & Opt Sci LAM Netwrok	Algiers, ALGERIAAlgiers, ALGERIA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0575-2	WOS:000260450900016

To prevent any limitations in the immobilization of nanocatalysts onto a working electrode substrate with binders, direct growth of MOF-derived TMC catalysts on a conductive substrate could be an improved fabrication strategy for realizing durable electrode systems. Herein, we report a facile method for growing cobalt-based zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) by using a cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)(2)) layer electrodeposited on carbon paper (CP). Subsequently, ZIF-67 was used as a sacrificial template and converted into amorphous cobalt sulfide (CoxSy) to form CoxSy@Co(OH)(2)/CP by a post-treatment process (etching with thioacetamide). The final CP electrode incorporating the catalytic system (CoxSy@Co(OH)(2)/CP) exhibited remarkable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance with an overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and stable activity after 24 h of continuous operation at a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). The excellent OER activity of the fabricated electrode system is attributed to the high surface area inherited from the MOF template, the robust structure of the catalytic system, the relatively large number of unsaturated surface sites of CoxSy, and the heterogeneous interface of amorphous CoxSy-crystalline Co(OH)(2).									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000855736400001

Besides, the rapid kinetics of the HER reaction have been demonstrated by a corresponding small Tafel slope value of 57.7 mV dec(-1). The high HER performance of the MnP-MoP NPs/N,P-Gr hybrid could be inherited from the merits of graphene, N,P-codoped effect, and the synergistic effect between MnP-MoP NPs and N,P-codoped graphene substrate. Notably, the MnP-MoP NPs/N,P-Gr hybrid exhibited superior stability toward HER, with retaining its electrocatalytic performance after 26 h stability test.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000521957200012

Herein, we designed and synthesized novel Fe2P nanoparticles embedded in an N,P co-doped mesoporous carbon catalyst (Fe2P/NPC) through direct pyrolysis of o-methylaniline in the presence of FeCl3<bold></bold>6H(2)O, H3PO4, silica nanospheres, and hexadecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles. Transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the obtained three-dimensional mesoporous Fe2P/NPC catalyst possessed a considerable specific surface area of 785 m(2) g(-1) with high contents of Fe2P nanoparticles, pyridinic N, and graphitic N species. Electrochemical evaluations showed that the formed Fe2P/NPC exhibited superior ORR performance to Pt/C in terms of a comparable onset potential (-0.01 V vs. Ag/AgCl electrode), about 20 mV higher half-wave potential, excellent stability and remarkable methanol tolerance in alkaline media. The synergistic effect of pyridinic N, graphitic N and Fe2P species together with its three-dimensional porous structure contribute to the impressive ORR performance. This research, most importantly, provides new clues to the rational development of cost-effective FePx-based catalysts for the ORR.									5	1	0	0	0	0	6			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000435298100016

Owing to the scarcity of the current state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts, cost-effective Pt-free materials such as transition metal nitrides and their derivatives have gained overwhelming interest as alternatives. In particular, cobalt nitride (CoN) has demonstrated a reasonably high ORR activity. However, the nature of its active phase still remains elusive. Here, we employ density functional theory calculations to study the surface reactivity of rocksalt (RS) and zincblend (ZB) cobalt nitride. The performances of the catalysts terminated by the facets of (100), (110), and (111) are studied for the ORR. We demonstrate that the cobalt nitride surface is highly susceptible to oxidation under ORR conditions. The as-formed oxide overlayer on the facets of CoNRS(100) and CoNZB(110) presents a significant promotional effect in reducing the ORR overpotential, thereby increasing the activity in comparison with those of the pure CoNs. The results of this work rationalize a number of experimental reports in the literature and disclose the nature of the active phase of cobalt nitrides for the ORR. Moreover, they offer guidelines for understanding the activity of other transition metal nitrides and designing efficient catalysts for future generation of PEMFCs.									37	3	0	0	4	0	38			1932-7447			WOS:000427331300005

Adsorbed hydroxyl radicals (OH center dot) were produced during water oxidation at the semiconductor surface under UV-visible irradiation and were subsequently electrochemically titrated by tip-generated reductant without irradiation. The IrCl62-/3- redox couple was used to determine the surface concentration of OH. in acidic solution. On W/Mo-BiVO4, similar to 6% of the absorbed photons generate surface OH center dot with a coverage of 5.8 mC cm(-2). Less than 1% of the irradiated photons were eventually used for water oxidation under high intensity irradiation (similar to 1 W cm(-2)) at the photoanode. Assuming that the primary decay mechanism of the adsorbed OH center dot on W/Mo-BiVO4 is dimerization to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the rate constant was determined to be 4 X 10(3) mol(-1) m(2) s(-1). A faster decay rate of OH center dot was observed in the presence of excess methanol (a radical scavenger) in aqueous solution. In addition, quantitative analysis of the water oxidation processes at W/Mo-BiVO4 along with the quantum efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction was determined using SECM.									86	4	0	0	4	0	88			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000320640500024

In the present article, we have investigated the photocatalytic properties of single-layer group IV-VI monochalcogenides, MXs (M = Ge, Si, Sn and X = S, Se) based on first-principles electronic structure calculations. Our dispersion corrected DFT calculations show that these materials have moderate cohesive energies (<120 meV/atom), which are indicative of favorable isolation of MX monolayers by mechanical, sonicated, or liquid-phase exfoliation. The calculated band gaps using hybrid density functional method (HSE06) reveal that all of the MXs show larger band gaps than the minimum energy required for the water splitting reaction (1.23 eV). Considering, band edge alignments, all the MXs other than SiS have an acceptable alignment of conduction band minima but not the valence band maxima. We have evaluated the overpotentials for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Interestingly, considering contribution from overpotentials, we have tuned the band alignments by varying the pH of the medium. At a basic pH, GeS and SiSe exhibit excellent photocatalytic properties whereas for SiS, an acidic pH is required. Additionally, the optical absorption spectrum shows excellent absorption in the visible region indicating efficient harvesting of solar radiation. They are substantially stable even in aqueous environment indicating their robust stability at ambient electrochemical conditions.									120	4	0	0	7	0	122			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000399629000005

According to HRTEM, they are characterized by exposure of different surfaces: {100} surface for nanocubes; {100}, {110}, and in part {111} for nanorods; and mainly {1 1 1} for conventional polycrystalline ceria, with a morphology dominated by {111}-enclosed octahedral particles. The presence of more-reactive exposed surfaces affects the reaction of soot oxidation positively, with an increase in activity in nanoshaped materials compared with conventional ceria. Thermal aging, although detrimental for surface area, is shown to affect morphology by promoting irregular truncation of edges and corners and development of more reactive surface combinations in all crystal shapes. It is likely that thermal treatment, starting from either cubes or octahedral particles, induces the formation of a similar particle geometry whose activity is dependent on the type of plane exposed and by the number an extension of edge and corners, thus linking reactivity of octahedral particles in conventional ceria powders with that of cubes in nanoshaped materials. The results indicate that soot oxidation is also a surface-dependent reaction, and catalyst design for this purpose should allow for surface structure morphology and its evolution against temperature.									322	19	0	0	27	0	328			2155-5435			WOS:000329472600023

Among CuPt nanostructures, nanocages attract great interest for catalysis as they allow passage of reactant species to their porous interiors, which provide a high fraction of surface sites. They may also enhance reactivity through an increase in collision frequency by enclosing reagents within nanoscale cavities and by lattice strain effects of the alloy. Recent reports apply solvothermal chemistry to obtain CuPt nanocages in one step. However, there is still a lack of understanding in the formation mechanism and its impact on catalytic activity for such hollow CuPt nanostructures. In this work, we adopt a two-step method in which we synthesize rhombic dodecahedral (RD) Cu-CuPt core-shell nanocrystals by the deposition of Pt on Cu nanocubes to form CuPt shells less than 2 nm in thickness, followed by removing Cu cores to obtain ultrathin octahedral (OCT) nanocages for catalytic applications. By adjustment to shorter and longer reaction time frames, the core-shell nanocrystals were also made into quasi-RD (QRD) and spiny-RD (SRD) morphologies, which lead to porous (POCT) and spiny (SOCT) OCT nanocages, respectively, upon etching. These three types of CuPt nanocages (POCT, OCT, and SOCT) were then examined in the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by the hydrolysis of NH3BH3 to study their performance. As a result, the SOCT CuPt nanocages exhibit the highest Pt mass activity (0.3 A/mg,) in the ORR, a 3-fold improvement over commercial Pt/C. They also show the lowest activation energy (24.3 kJ/mol) in the HER that is better than the commercial catalyst by a factor of 4. HER photocatalysis results show that the POCT and OCT nanocages have localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)-enhancement while the SOCT nanocages do not, which is attributed to inhomogeneity in Cu-Pt distributions at shorter reaction times.									9	2	0	0	0	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000553241400025

Sulphuric acid, hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid and aminopropyl triethoxy silane were adopted to modify the granular activated carbon. The structural characterizations suggested that the carbon materials had a large surface area, abundant pore structure, and a high number of oxygen-containing functional groups, which influenced the Pt-based catalysts on the particle size, dispersion and dehydrogenation activity. The hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction technique was utilized to investigate the interaction between the active component Pt and the various functionalized granular activated carbon materials. The CO pulse technique revealed the particle sizes and dispersion of the as-prepared Pt-based catalysts. Finally, the Pt-based catalysts were successfully applied to study their catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation reaction of methylcyclohexane. The results showed that the Pt-based catalyst over granular activated carbon functionalized with sulphuric acid groups had a higher conversion of methylcyclohexane (63%) and a larger hydrogen evolution rate (741.1 mmol g(Pt)(-1) min(-1)) than the other resulting Pt-based catalysts at 300 degrees C.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7				2046-2069		WOS:000702237900016	35479578

Electrolytic water splitting using proton exchange membrane electrolysers (PEMEs) provides a pathway to sustainable hydrogen production through coupling to renewable energy sources, but can suffer from gas crossover at low current densities and high operating pressures, causing explosive gas mixtures and decreasing cell lifetimes. Here we demonstrate the application of a highly stable, organic electron-coupled proton buffer (ECPB) which allows the decoupling of hydrogen and oxygen production during water splitting. By merging concepts from redox flow battery and PEM electrolysis research, we have built a hybrid electrolyser device capable of decoupling the gas evolution reactions during water splitting. The device improves on both gas purity and operational safety, while still working at industrially relevant, high current density. Anthraquinone-2,7- disulfonic acid was used as an organic redox mediator in this two-step process, producing H-2 at current densities of up to 3.71 A cm(-2) at 2.00 V, extending the concept of the ECPB.									26	1	0	0	2	0	28			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000424649300025	29675207

Corn crumb (CC) from by-products of food industry provides a fibriform N-containing biochar backbone by in situ pyrolysis, while W from the in situ electroreduction of WS2 would infiltrate into the carbon matrix under the effect of an applied electric field, contributing to the crystallization of WC along the fibers so that gnarled root-like composites are fabricated. The electrocatalytic behavior of the prepared materials are investigated in detail, the optimized sample (WC/CC-1/2) exhibits a decent onset potential of 0.865 V vs RHE for ORR in 1 M KOH solution and a four-electron pathway is dominant.

In this work, by utilization of operando K-beta 1,K-3 high-energy resolution fluorescence-detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD-XAS) with a small incident angle, the operando quadrupole transition obviously showed that oxygen directly interacted with 3d orbitals of Co ions rather than that of Fe ions. Most importantly, Fe ions can promote the stabilization of the Co ions under a higher valent state during water oxidation, which may lead to a stable intermediate of reactant and its superior intrinsic activity. Accompanied by the first-principle calculations, the intermediates between 3d orbitals for surface Co ions and O 2p orbitals for the attaching hydroxide ions were ascribed to this orbital hybridization. Because of the unvaried structural features in conventional in situ techniques, operando HERFD-XAS revealed the remarkable change of chemical status to correlate with the orbital interaction rather than with the structural variation. This operando HERFD-XAS approach corresponding to the local orbital interaction in reactant/catalyst interface can potentially offer synergetic strategies toward realizing the chemical reactions or reaction pathways in various fields.									64	2	0	0	3	0	64			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000453488500053	30441896

The former yields 0.40 V and the latter 0.48 V, both close to the observed value of similar to0.40 V. Electrode-potential-dependent activation energies are calculated using the interface model for the reduction of the hydronium ion to form the Pt-H bond and for the reverse oxidation reaction over the -0.3 to 3.0 V range. To make this possible, the model explicitly excludes the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathodic end and water oxidation at the anodic end of the potential range. Cathodic and anodic symmetry factors are determined from the slopes of the activation energy curves, which are used as models for the corresponding activation free energy curves. They are extended into the Marcus-inverted regions for oxidation and reduction. The symmetry factors add to 1.0 in the normal region and in the inverted regions and are not linear functions of the electrode potential.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000182893700019

These processes will be dependent on the permeability structure and mineral compositions of the reservoirs, but there is limited observational data on their rates. In this paper we report the cation and anion concentrations and Sr, oxygen and carbon isotopic compositions of formation waters from four extraction wells sampled at surface, over similar to 6 months after commencement of CO2 injection in a five spot pattern for enhanced oil recovery at the Salt Creek field, Wyoming. Sampled fluids, separated from the minor oil component, exhibit near-monotonic increases in alkalinity and concentrations of cations but lithe change in Cl and Br concentrations and oxygen and deuterium isotope ratios. The increases in alkalinity are modelled in terms of reaction with reservoir calcite and silicate minerals as the changes in fluid chemistry and Sr-isotopic compositions are inconsistent with simple addition of injected fluids sampled over the course of the experiment. The reservoir mineral chemical and isotopic compositions are characterised by sampling core as well as surface exposures of the Frontier Formation elsewhere in Wyoming. The evolution of the fluid chemistries reflects extensive dissolution of both carbonate and silicate minerals over the course of the six months sampling implying rapid dissolution of CO2 in the formation waters and reaction of CO2-bearing brines with formation minerals. Rates of CO2 diffusion into the brines and advection of CO2 charged brines in the reservoir are sufficiently slow that, if present, calcite should react to be close to equilibrium with the fluids. This allows estimation of the CO2 partial pressures in the sampled fluids and comparison with the thermodynamic driving force for the relatively rapid average plagioclase dissolution rates of similar to 10(-12) mol.m(-2)s(-1).									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0009-2541	1872-6836		WOS:000409517800002

We studied developmental plasticity of the widespread tropical butterfly, Bicyclus safitza, which reaches the southern edge of its distribution in the temperate zone of South Africa. In wet-dry seasonal environments in tropical Africa, adults of Bicyclus butterflies are present all year round and exhibit discrete seasonal forms in alternating generations. We demonstrate that a population that colonized a more temperate climate region has adopted a different strategy to cope with the local environment. No active adults were encountered during the temperate winter. The flight season coincided with a period when evaporation stress was lowest and temperatures were higher in the South African population. Butterflies collected from the field did not express seasonal polyphenism or show full expression of the tropical wet season form phenotype. Reaction norm experiments comparing stocks from South Africa and Uganda indicated that local adaptation of this tropical butterfly to a more temperate climate involved changes in the degree of developmental plasticity, such that a more robust development in response to thermal variation was observed for a broad suite of morphological and life-history traits. Our findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that facilitate expansion into a novel ecological niche in seasonally variable climatic conditions.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000423313000002

The electrocatalysis performances of the PtFeCu concave octahedron nanocrystals are better than those of the PtFe and PtCu nanocrystals and commercial Pt/C. The synergistic effect of the Pt, Fe, and Cu metals and the unique concave octahedron morphology may be the main cause of the superior electrocatalytic performances of the PtFeCu nanocrystals. The PtFeCu concave octahedron nanocrystals have a potential application as an anode catalyst for direct methanol fuel cells.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000505633700008	31790270

Identifying the structure evolution and real-time active structure of Co-based electrocatalysts under operational conditions is crucial for understanding the OER mechanism and rational design of efficient catalysts. Here, we systematically synthesized three types of Co-based precatalysts, including Co/graphene oxide (GO), Co-CoO/GO and Co3O4/GO, to clarify the critical effects of the precatalyst structure for OER. The electrochemical test results confirm that the Co-CoO/GO precatalyst shows a lower overpotential compared to Co/GO and Co3O4/GO precatalysts and commercial RuO2/C. A thorough in situ analysis by XAFS revealed that the Co-CoO/GO precatalysts are oxidized and self-assembled into CoOOH during water oxidation and possess a much higher O vacancy density compared with the CoOOH derived from Co/GO, while the Co3O4/GO precatalyst maintains its structure during operation. This strategy of in situ creation of defects in CoOOH provides a guideline for the rational design of future catalysis systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000828406800001

Considering the shell structure can significantly affect the properties of HoMSs, in this paper, we provide a novel one-step strategy to continually regulate the shell structures of HoMSs. Through a simple phosphorization process, we can effectively modify the shell from solid to bubble-like and even duplicate the shells with a narrow spacing. Benefitting from the structure merits, the fabricated CoP HoMSs with close duplicated shells can promote gas release owing to the unbalanced Laplace pressure, while accelerating liquid transfer for enhanced capillary force. It can provide effective channels for water and gas and thus exhibits a superior electrocatalytic performance in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction.									37	2	0	0	0	0	38			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000618975200001	33496361

Nanostructured transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have recently emerged as versatile and efficient catalysts in the fields of clean production of fossil fuels, renewable energies, and energy storage technologies. In this review, popular strategies to fabricate TMPs are initially summarized. Then, we present the diverse applications of TMPs as active catalysts in thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and energy storage techniques, with special emphasis on the dependence of reaction activities on the features of TMPs. Throughout the various applications of TMPs, it can be inferred that TMPs themselves play key roles in some cases. While in other cases, it is the synergistic effect of surface oxidation and intrinsic TMPs that is responsible for the high reaction performances. At last, the future perspectives of TMPs are pointed out.									136	8	0	0	2	0	137			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000599751100005

Herein, selenium-doped CoP nanoneedles construct the grass-like structure, and the nanoneedles are vertically anchored on carbon cloth (Se-CoP/CC). Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy reveal the nanoneedle array architecture of S-CoP, which is convenient for the adsorption of molecules on active centers. The small diameter of nanoneedles is beneficial for rapid charge transfer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows the electronic structure regulation of Se incorporation, which is beneficial for the optimized catalysis activity. Electrochemical tests show that Se dopants result in more catalysis sites and faster kinetics. Endowed with these advantages, good catalytic performance of the prepared sample for hydrogen evolution is disclosed, with low overpotentials of 47 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and 145 mV at 100 mA cm-2 in alkaline solution. This work highlights a promising way to improve the performance of transition-metal-based catalysts with non-metal-doping engineering toward water electrolysis application.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000874611600001

Here, Co nanoparticles were embedded in the 3D CoO matrix via a template-free method, including cobalt hydroxy-carbonate nanowire arrays grown on Ni foam and the following non-contact Al-reduction process. The as-prepared 3D hierarchical structured Co/CoO nanowires possess good charge transfer and mass transport properties, and a synergistic effect at the Co/CoO interface can hugely facilitate the HER kinetics. A suitable balance between Co and CoO in the catalyst is crucial for high catalytic activity. And the optimal Co/CoO array exhibited outstanding HER activities in 1 M NaOH, achieving nearly zero onset potential, and a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) with a small overpotential of 167 mV. They also showed good long-term stabilities. This hybrid Co/CoO nanowire array is a promising material for large-scale hydrogen production from water-splitting.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18				2046-2069		WOS:000374972800003

We catalogue and quantify the source strengths of the most probable electron donors and electron acceptors that would have been available to fuel early-Earth ecosystems. The most active ecosystems were probably driven by the cycling of H-2 and Fe2+ through primary production conducted by anoxygenic phototrophs. Interesting and dynamic ecosystems would have also been driven by the microbial cycling of sulphur and nitrogen species, but their activity levels were probably not so great. Despite the diversity of potential early ecosystems, rates of primary production in the early-Earth anaerobic biosphere were probably well below those rates observed in the marine environment. We shift our attention to the Earth environment at 3.8 Gyr ago, where the earliest marine sediments are preserved. We calculate, consistent with the carbon isotope record and other considerations of the carbon cycle, that marine rates of primary production at this time were probably an order of magnitude (or more) less than today. We conclude that the flux of reduced species to the Earth surface at this time may have been sufficient to drive anaerobic ecosystems of sufficient activity to be consistent with the carbon isotope record. Conversely, an ecosystem based on oxygenic photosynthesis was also possible with complete removal of the oxygen by reaction with reduced species from the mantle.

Here, using liquid cell (LC) transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we study the corrosion process of palladium@platinum (Pd@Pt) core-shell octahedra in real time and reveal that both the static local strain and the evolving curvature synergistically control the nanoscale corrosion kinetics. Specifically, in locations with tensile strain and high local curvature, the etching process is much faster. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation suggests that the dissolution potential of the Pd nanocrystal decreases as the strain increases; meanwhile, Pd atoms tend to be corroded more easily on a surface under tensile strain than on one under compressive strain. With these insights on the corrosion mechanism at the nanoscale, we subsequently designed and synthesized nanoparticles with smaller strain, and these showed higher durability in both an in situ LC study and an ex situ ORR stability test.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			2451-9294			WOS:000575403300012

Metal/oxide hybrid structure has been intensively investigated to achieve promising catalytic performance, especially in neutral or alkaline electrocatalysis where water dissociation is promoted near the oxide surface for (de)protonation of intermediates. Although catalytic promise of the hybrid structure is demonstrated, it is still challenging to precisely modulate metal/oxide interfacial interactions on the nanoscale. Herein, we report an effective strategy to construct rich metal/oxide nano-interfaces on conductive carbon supports in a surfactant-free and self-terminated way. When compared to the physically mixed Pd/CeO2 system, a much higher degree of interface formation was identified with largely improved hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics. The benefits of the rich metal-CeO2 interface were further generalized to Pd alloys for optimized adsorption energy, where the Pd3Ni/CeO2/C catalyst shows superior performance with HOR selectivity against CO poisoning and shows long-term stability. We believe this work highlights the importance of controlling the interfacial junctions of the electrocatalyst in simultaneously achieving enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000862369900001	36153951

How to synthesize cobalt silicate with excellent energy storage and OER properties has not been reported and it is a great challenge for researchers to accomplish it. In this work, we find that the electrochemical properties of CoSi are particularly affected by critical factors during the synthesis process. Three types of CoSi compounds are synthesized using Stober SiO2 as the self-sacrificing template via a hydrothermal reaction. The CoSi compounds generated from different reaction systems have obvious differences in the macrostate, microscopic morphology, composition and valence, leading to different electrochemical performances for energy storage and OER properties. The findings reveal that the differences (especially valence) among CoSi are determined by the formation of the metal source in the reaction system. The specific capacitance of CoSi-3 obtained from the system with basic salts as the metal source is eight times higher than that of CoSi-1 obtained from the system with coordination compounds as the metal source, whereas CoSi-1 has a greater advantage in electrocatalytic activity. This work provides insight for the synthesis of cobalt silicates applied to energy storage and conversion.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000749722000001	35088786

Despite great efforts to optimize catalyst activity, their broad application in practical settings has been restricted by the low efficiency of hydrogen peroxide or persulfate decomposition as well as ultrafast self-quenching of the activated radicals. Theoretical calculations predicted that two-dimensional (2D) metallic 1T phase MoS2 materials with exposed (001) surfaces and (100) edges should have remarkable affinity towards crucial intermediates in the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy were used to show that the exposed metallic Mo sites accelerate the rate-limiting step of electron transfer. A lamellar membrane made from a stack of 2D MoS2 with tunable interspacing was then designed as the catalyst. The non-linear transport between the MoS2 nanolayers leads to high water diffusivity so that the short-lived reactive radicals efficiently oxidize contaminants.									193	8	0	0	88	0	197			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000474117600037	31020744

However, the implementation of LMBs in practice is still facing numerous challenges, such as low Coulombic efficiency, poor cycling performance, and complicated interfacial reactions.

Herein, nanoscale PtCuMn hexapods (HPDs) have been synthesized by a facile one-pot solvent method. Strikingly, the as-synthesized HPDs each contain a rhombic dodecahedral host and six nanopods protruding from its & lang;100 & rang; vertices. Evolution experiments demonstrate that four stages are responsible for formation of the HPDs: the preferential formation of Cu-enriched nuclei, the galvanic substitution reaction between Cu-enriched nuclei and a Pt precursor, the selective growth of Pt, and the deposition of Pt, Cu, and Mn. Moreover, the morphology of the HPDs can be tuned by adjusting the dosage of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide because of its ability to affect the size of the preformed Cu-enriched nuclei and the rate of the galvanic substitution reaction during the synthesis. For methanol electrocatalysis, the PtCuMn HPDs exhibit substantially enhanced electrocatalytic activity and durability in comparison with the commercial Pt/C catalyst. It is expected that this work may provide an idea for the facile synthesis of Pt-based catalysts with high efficiency and stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2574-0970		WOS:000856566300001

Char combustion under the present conditions was found to be controlled by the combination of pore diffusion and chemical reaction. Both the char density and size gradually decrease with burnoff, while the char surface area increases up to a burnoff of 40 to 50 pct due to the formation of a large amount of meso- and micropores, which were observed by high-resolution field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and gas adsorption measurements. Despite the obvious increase in surface area, the char combustion reactivity decreases with burnoff. This is due to the loss of the intrinsic reactivity of char during combustion, as confirmed by fixed-bed (FB) measurements of fresh char and chars partly burnt in a DTF The structural characterization by quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis (QXRDA) shows that the amorphous concentration (f(am)) of the char decreases during combustion, while the aromaticity (f(ar)) and the average crystallite size (L-002) of the char increase. The char becomes more ordered during combustion, which is in accordance with the observations made using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The char structural ordering observed was found to be responsible for the loss of char intrinsic reactivity during combustion. Based on the QXRDA, a char structure model has also been suggested to explain the char structural evolution observed during combustion. The implications of char structural evolution for char combustion during a PCI operation are also discussed.									52	5	0	0	0	0	54			1073-5615			WOS:000171471000007

The physico-chemical properties of pyrolyzed RH chars were characterized by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS),specific surface area and pore size analyzer,X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, respectively. The effects of temperature on evolution of physico-chemical structures of RH chars were discussed. The results indicate that the specific surface area and pore volume of RH chars increase significantly from 850 to 1 150 ℃. The order of release of alkaline and alkaline earth metals (AAEMs) bound in RH is Na > Ca > Mg > K. With increasing reaction temperature, release fractions of AAEMs generally increase firstly and then being stable, and the chlorine release fraction increases gradually. AAEMs in RH chars are mainly in the form of silicate and sulfate. The surface oxygen-containing functional groups in RH chars decrease significantly with increasing temperature.			利用高温携带流装置,在再燃条件下获得了不同的稻壳焦。采用元素分析、SEM-EDS分析、N_2吸附-脱附、ICP-AES、XRD和FT_IR等手段对稻壳焦的理化结构进行了分析与表征,研究了再燃温度对稻壳再燃过程中灰焦理化结构演化规律的影响。结果表明,在850-1 150 ℃,反应温度的升高有利于稻壳焦孔隙结构的形成,进而有效提高稻壳焦的比表面积和孔容积。稻壳中碱(土)金属元素的释放顺序为Na>Ca>Mg>K,且随温度升高,碱(土)金属元素的释放率呈现先略微升高后逐渐趋于稳定的趋势,氯的释放率逐渐增大。稻壳焦中的碱(土)金属主要以硅酸盐和硫酸盐的形式存在。稻壳焦表面含氧官能团随反应温度的升高逐渐减少。						0	1	0		0	0	1			0253-2409			CSCD:6042123

A jump was found on the Tafel line in NaOH solution but not in LiOH, KOH and CsOH solutions, even after giving an anodic activation treatment to the electrode. The amount of deposited Na, K and Cs on Ag plate electrodes, polarized cathodically in respective solutions, was analysed by AES and XPS as a function of hydrogen overpotential. It was confirmed that Na was deposited on the Ag electrode and the coverage with Na was the cause of the jump on the Tafel line. The monolayer deposition was completed at about 0.8 V of hydrogen overpotential. Similarities were found between the deposition states in this work and those reported in the literature on the gas phase Na adsorption on Ag. On the other hand, no indication of analogous deposition was obtained for Li, K and Cs.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-4686			WOS:A1991GL86800008

Compared with conventional supports, 2D materials with large surface areas, unique geometric structure, and electronic properties can boost the catalytic performances of anchored single noble atoms (SNAs). Meanwhile, the monodispersed atoms not only show much higher atom utilization, than their bulk or nanoparticle counterparts, but also provide an alternative reaction pathway with excellent activity and selectivity. However, the combination of a 2D material with single atoms still comes across some challenges, such as low mass loading, difficulty in anchoring the single atoms on the 2D substrates, and difficulty in mass production. In this review, single noble-metal atoms based on two-dimensional materials (SNA@2DM) are critically discussed. First, SNA@2DMs are generally introduced, including their definition, characterization, and their importance and advantages in catalysis. Then, the recent progress in using the SNA@2DMs for the photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic reactions is thoroughly reviewed and critically discussed. The superiority and the disadvantages of SNA@2DMs in each catalytic reaction are also considered. Finally, the current challenges and opportunities in the synthesis and applications of SNA@2DM are clearly highlighted.									19	2	0	0	1	0	19			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000702935400002

LEAD-ACID BATTERIES AND CAPACITORS, NEW DESIGNS, AND NEW APPLICATIONS		ECS Transactions		41	13			3	16		10.1149/1.3691907				2012	2012	The mechanism by which conventional lead-acid batteries (both flooded and valve-regulated designs) fail when subjected to high-rate partial-state-of-charge (HRPSoC) operation in hybrid electric vehicles is manifested as poor dynamic charge acceptance at the negative plate. This parameter is defined as the amount of charge that is actually delivered to the battery during regenerative braking phases of a driving cycle, divided by the amount of charge that could have been provided by the generator. The possible reasons for this mode of failure are discussed in terms of the processes that support the charge reaction and the competing secondary reactions that can take place at the plate during charge, namely: oxygen reduction (for valve-regulated designs), hydrogen evolution, and the accumulation of capacitive charge. To reach a full understanding of the processes associated with the unusual duty of HRPSoC operation, it is necessary: (i) to examine aspects of the charge reaction that, to date, have received little attention, e. g., local reaction within the pores of the plate active-material, effects of acid concentration on the local solubility of lead sulfate, non-uniformity of potential across the plate; (ii) to evaluate the beneficial effects to be gained from the respective use of carbon, modifications of grid design (twin tab), and the UltraBattery (TM) concept.

Density functional theory simulation shows that CO is oxidized on Pt-13 via dissociative oxygen adsorption. The calculated activation energy for the dissociation of O-2 on Pt-13 is 56 kJ/mol. It is found that when a cobalt atom is introduced into the cluster, the activation energy falls for the stages of CO oxidation and the dissociation of O-2. Catalytic tests performed on Pt and Pt0.5Co0.5 nanopowders confirm the Pt-Co system displays high activity in the oxidation of CO.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-0244	1531-863X		WOS:000487653000016

Due to higher electrochemical stability of platinum, the K2FeO4 electrode using platinum lattice as current collector displays better primary discharge performance than those with silver lattice and nickel foam as current collectors. The galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments indicate that the K2FeO4 electrodes have low electrochemical reversibility, which may result from their relatively lower oxygen evolution potentials or the effects of the oxidation/reduction of current collectors. The experimental results of intermittent discharge, cycle voltammetry, and XRD show that the discharge reaction of the K2FeO4 electrode may consist of two steps.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			1023-1935	1608-3342		WOS:000237052600004

Scission and recombination reactions compete during oxidative ageing. In the case of natural rubber, the molecular evolution exhibits a dual process, whereas, rapid crosslinking occurs from the beginning of the thermo-oxidation of EPDM. A chemical change has been simultaneously detected by FTIR for the two kinds of diene materials. These specific behaviours are compared to those upon photo-oxidation. No difference is recorded for NR. In contrast, the chronology of events depends on the process of oxidative ageing in case of EPDM. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tao, Renbiao; Zhang, Lijuan; Zhang, Lifei								Redox evolution of western Tianshan subduction zone and its effect on deep carbon cycle								GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS				11	3			915	924		10.1016/j.gsf.2019.09.007				MAY 2020	2020	Knowing the phase relations of carbon-bearing phases at high-pressure (HP) and high-temperature (HT) condition is essential for understanding the deep carbon cycle in the subduction zones. In particular, the phase relation of carbon-bearing phases is also strongly influenced by redox condition of subduction zones, which is poorly explored. Here we summarized the phase relations of carbon-bearing phases (calcite, aragonite, dolomite, magnesite, graphite, hydrocarbon) in HP metamorphic rocks (marble, metapelite, eclogite) from the Western Tianshan subduction zone and high-pressure experiments. During prograde progress of subduction, carbonates in altered oceanic crust change from Ca-carbonate (calcite) to Ca,Mg-carbonate (dolomite), then finally to Mg-carbonate (magnesite) via Mg-Ca cation exchange reaction between silicate and carbonate, while calcite in sedimentary calcareous ooze on oceanic crust directly transfers to high-pressure aragonite in marble or amorphous CaCO3 in subduction zones. Redox evolution also plays a significant effect on the carbon speciation in the Western Tianshan subduction zone. The prograde oxygen fugacity of the Western Tianshan subduction zone was constrained by mineral assemblage of garnet-omphacite from FMQ - 1.9 to FMQ - 2.5 at its metamorphic peak (maximum P-T) conditions. In comparison with redox conditions of other subduction zones, Western Tianshan has the lowest oxygen fugacity. Graphite and light hydrocarbon inclusions were ubiqutously identified in Western Tianshan HP metamorphic rocks and speculated to be formed from reduction of Fe-carbonate at low redox condition, which is also confirmed by high-pressure experimental simulation. Based on petrological observation and high-pressure simulation, a polarized redox model of reducing slab but oxidizing mantle wedge in subduction zone is proposed, and its effect on deep carbon cycle in subduction zones is further discussed.									10	3	0	0	0	0	10			1674-9871			WOS:000530750200015

However, their unsatisfactory stability limits their practical application. Herein, we demonstrate a dual-shell Fe-N-C electrocatalyst with excellent catalytic activity and long-term stability. Pyrrole and dopamine are sequentially polymerized on a fumed silica nanoparticle template. Metal precursor (FeCl3) and pore formation agent (ZnCl2) were loaded on the inner polypyrrole shell. During carbonization, the Zn evaporation creates abundant mesopores in the polydopamine-derived outer carbon shell, forming a "chain mail" like outer shell that protects Fe-N-C active sites loaded on the inner carbon shell and enables efficient mass transfer. Systematical tuning of the shield thickness and porosity affords the optimal electrocatalyst with a large surface area of 934 m(2) g(-1) and a high Fe loading of 2.04 wt%. This electrocatalyst delivers excellent ORR activity and superior stability in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Primary Zn-air batteries fabricated from this electrocatalyst delivers a high-power density of 257 mW cm(-2) and impressive durability of continuous discharging over 250 h. Creating a graphitic and porous carbon protective shell can be further extended to other electrocatalysts to enable their practical applications in energy conversion and storage.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2096-6482	2589-9651		WOS:000854922000001

However, the simultaneous evolution of H-2 and O-2 requires a fluorine-containing proton exchange membrane to prevent the gases from mixing while using the same space to concentrate the gases, which significantly increases the cost and reduces the flexibility of this approach. Here, a battery electrode based on the highly reversible enolization reaction of pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone is first introduced as a solid-state proton buffer to separate the O-2 and H-2 evolution of acidic water electrolysis in space and time, through which the gas mixing issue can be avoided without using any membrane. This process allows us to separately consider H-2 and O-2 production according to the variation in input power (e.g., the renewable energy) and/or the location for H-2 concentration, thus showing high flexibility for H-2 production.									27	6	0	0	2	0	29			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462622700029	30706609

The key element depends on engineering the electronic structure and surface properties of material to achieve improved catalytic activity. Herein, a hierarchical nanowire array of metal sulfides heterostructure on nickel foam (FeCoNiSx/NF) was designed as a novel type of hybrid electrocatalyst for overall water splitting. The hybrid structure endowed plenty of catalytic active sites, strong electronic interactions, and high interfacial charge transferability, leading to superior bifunctional performance. As a result, the FeCoNiSx/NF catalyst delivered low overpotentials of 97 and 260 mV at the current density of 50 mA cm(-2) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. Moreover, the FeCoNiSx/NF-based water electrolyzer exhibited a small potential of 1.57 V for a high current density of 50 mA cm(-2). These results indicate the promising application potential of FeCoNiSx/NF electrode for hydrogen generation. This work provides a new approach to develop robust hybrid materials as the highly active electrode for electrocatalytic water splitting.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000811246100001	35590444

To improve the oxygen evolution reaction rates (OERs) and utilize more visible light, flower-like cobalt hydroxide/oxide (Fw-Co(OH)(2)/Fw-Co3O4) photocatalysts were prepared and loaded onto graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) by a facile coating method in this work. Influenced by the unique three-dimensional morphologies, the synthesized Fw-Co(OH)(2) or Fw-Co3O4/g-C3N4 hybrids reveal favorable combination and synergism reflected by the modified photoelectric activities and the improved OER performances. Attributed to its prominent hydrotalcite structure, Fw-Co(OH)(2) shows better cocatalytic activity for g-C3N4 modification compared with that of Fw-Co3O4. Specifically, 7 wt % Fw-Co(OH)(2)/g-C3N4 photocatalyst exhibits photocurrent density 4 times higher and OER performance 5 times better than pristine g-C3N4. This work unambiguously promotes the application of sustainable g-C3N4 in water oxidation.									74	4	0	0	12	0	75			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000391081700028	27977127

Here, we present a new type of self-synergistic Co catalyst consisting of symbiotic Co single-atoms and nanoparticles (S/Co-SA-NPs) for use as a highly efficient ORR catalyst. The well-designed S/Co-SA-NP catalyst exhibits a record ORR activity with an excellent half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.925 V and a large kinetic current density (J(k)) of 122.57 mA cm(-2) at 0.85 V, which is tens of times that of benchmarking Pt/C catalyst. Using advanced operando electrochemical impedance and synchrotron infrared spectroscopies, we observe that the self-synergistic Co sites can effectively optimize *OOH adsorption at low driven overpotentials and promote the crucial *O intermediate to emerge on the Co sites during the ORR process, which suggests a fast four-electron mechanistic pathway for the ORR.									7	0	0	0	1	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000609149500035		
J	Seewald, JS								Model for the origin of carboxylic acids in basinal brines								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				65	21			3779	3789		10.1016/S0016-7037(01)00702-5				NOV 2001	2001	Carboxylic acids are ubiquitous in basinal brines from petroleum-producing sedimentary basins. Although the absolute concentrations of individual short-chain acids vary systematically over many orders of magnitude, relative abundances are characterized by approximately constant ratios. Laboratory experiments have demonstrated that oxidation of aqueous n-alkanes proceeds through a sequence of reactions involving alkene, alcohol, ketone, and carboxylic acid reaction intermediaries. The highly specific nature of these reactions allows the relative distribution of carboxylic acids produced during oxidation of n-alkanes to be predicted quantitatively as a function of petroleum composition. A model based on the results of laboratory experiments was developed to account for the thermogenic production of aqueous carboxylic acids in sedimentary basins.Model predictions are highly consistent with the distribution of carboxylic acids observed in nature. This result suggests that hydrocarbon oxidation reactions may be pervasive during petroleum maturation in sedimentary basins. Likely oxidizing agents include ferric iron-bearing aluminosilicates, oxides, and hydroxides, pyrite, sulfate-bearing minerals, and water. Such chemical interactions allow inorganic sedimentary components to act as sources of oxygen for the formation of oxygenated organic alteration products. Accordingly, the absolute amount and timing of carboxylic acid generation may not be limited by the compositional evolution of kerogen, as suggested by previous models.

We examined two sizes of Au DENs, denoted as G6-NH2(Au-147) and G6-NH2(Au-55), where G6-NH2 represents a sixth-generation, amine-terminated, poly(amidoamine) dendrimer and the subscripts, 147 and 55, represent the average number of atoms in each size of DENs. Ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results indicate that G6-NH2(Au-55) DENs grow to the same size as the G6-NH2(Au-147) DENs following these scans. Importantly, this growth occurs prior to the onset of detectable faradaic Au oxidation or reduction current. The observed growth in the size of the DENs directly correlates to changes in the electrocatalytic ORR activity. The key point is that after just three positive scans the G6-NH2(Au-147) and G6-NH2(Au-55) DENs are essentially indistinguishable in terms of both physical and electrocatalytic properties.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2196-0216			WOS:000674273100020

Herein, guidelines for selecting carbon support materials suitable for CO2RR are reported. In a gaseous CO2-fed CO2RR electrolyzer, an Ag nanoparticle-composited carbon nanocage (denoted as Ag/CNC) electrode exhibits an optimal performance for CO2RR with a partial current density of approximate to 400 mA cm(-2). Ag/CNC showcases a uniformly dispersed morphology with Ag nanoparticles and sufficient hydrophobicity after the reaction to prevent flooding, which is known to inhibit the mass transfer of CO2. Furthermore, the CNCs possess small amounts of carbon defects; this suppresses the catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a side reaction of CO2RR. Results of a three-stack cell experiment with the Ag/CNC electrode reveal the possibility of a support-based strategy for achieving an industrial-level scaling of CO2RR. This study suggests that the support material for CO2RR should be considered not only on the basis of the morphology of carbon, uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles, and hydrophobicity of the electrode but also factors influencing the HER, such as carbon defects.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2366-7486			WOS:000695799300001

The block copolymer PMPS-MPS-P([META(+)][PF6-]), prepared by this method, acts as a "nano bridge" and achieves Ni loading on TiO2 with the help of sol-gel method + thermal reduction. The atomic loading of Ni on TiO2 is achieved through strong covalent bonding, metallic bonding and the natural physical intertwining effect of silane coupling agent. Interestingly, it was unexpectedly found that the TiC stable structure generated by this process, the ionization of part of the block polyelectrolyte after the thermal reduction treatment at 773 K and the loading process of Ni all can promote the formation of oxygen vacancy Ov, which facilitates the charge transfer and hydrogen precipitation reaction. It has superior photocatalytic ability and cheaper cost compared to the conventional impregnation dispersion method. These findings provide a new idea to modify the manipulated photocatalysts by defect engineering to achieve efficient photocatalytic efficiency and capability.									1	1	0	0	1	0	2			2468-8231			WOS:000693014900008

Herein, composite catalyst with manganese oxide on N and O co-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated with FeCo alloy (CoFe@CNT/ MnO) was prepared in situ on CFP by hydrothermal and CVD pyrolysis methods. Owing to rich C=O functional group on in situ growing carbon nanotubes with 3D open structure, alloying effect of CoFe core metal embedded in carbon nanotube and the contribution of MnO supported on carbon nanotubes to ORR performance and stability, the CoFe@CNT/MnO catalyst exhibits low overpotential of 193 mV at the current density of 10 mA/ cm2 for OER, larger diffusion-limited current density of 5.75 mA/cm2 and half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85 V) for ORR, high specific capacity (810 mAh/gZn) and peak power density (164 mW/cm2) with the Zn-air battery and superior stability. Moreover, the peak power density of the single CoFe@CNT/MnO-based quasi-solid state ZAB could reach 142 mW/cm2, and two quasi-solid state ZABs connected in series can power a mini fan.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000681679500001

In order to optimize catalytic performance, the intrinsic electronic structure is adjusted by constructing the efficient interface coupling of Co4N/VN in composite. Owing to the strong synergistic coupling effect, the optimized Co-V-N/NC catalyst exhibited the best ORR performance with a limiting current density of 6.1 mA cm(-2), and the onset and half-wave potentials of 0.98 and 0.85 V, respectively. The results suggest that the excellent ORR activity of Co-V-N/NC is mainly associated with: (i) effective charge transfer and mass transport between CNN, VN and NC, (ii) a large number of active sites at the phase boundaries, and (iii) improved electrical conductivity due to incorporated metallic Co4N. Also, Co-V-N/NC catalyst is more durable and methanol-resistant compared to the commercial Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory suggests the importance of synergistic coupling with Co4N/VN to boost the ORR performance. These results indicate its prospects as efficient, cost-effective and robust catalyst for ORR in alkaline media, which is highly desired for fuel cell applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, carbonate is commonly regarded as a poor matrix to host photo-catalytic active species, and current literature has few reports of carbonate-based photocatalytic material. Herein, a hierarchically porous catalyst that features approximate to 5 nm deficient NiCO3 nanoparticles embedded in sponge-like high-magnesium calcite is disclosed. In the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, the as-prepared catalyst of low Ni content attains a high CO production rate of 10 565 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) and a high selectivity of 94% relative to H-2 evolution, a performance that surpasses many other state-of-the-art nickel-based catalysts. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbonate vacancy of NiCO3 strengthens the adsorption and activation of CO2 more significantly than the corresponding oxygen vacancy of NiO. The inert CO, molecule becomes highly deformed on the surface of NiCO3 which can be readily activated to the key intermediate CO2 center dot- for the photoreduction reaction. The present findings add to the existing knowledge of advanced catalysis using defect materials and demonstrate an intriguing and rare case of highly performing carbonate-based catalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2366-7486			WOS:000787730600001

In addition, complementary simulations with detailed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemistry and a detailed soot model, based on the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM), were performed and compared with the experimental critical strain rates for the sooting flames. Argon dilution was used to keep the thermal environment for the three fuel cases nearly the same to elucidate the chemical effects. Both experiment and simulation showed that n-heptane and n-butanol had similar sooting characteristics, while methyl butanoate had the least sooting propensity. Further sensitivity and reaction path analysis demonstrates that the three fuels share similar PAH chemical pathways, and C-5 and C-6 ring formation from the intermediate chain species is found to be the rate-limiting step. The differences in sooting propensity lie in the fuel breakdown processes. Specifically, the oxygen bounded in n-butanol does not reduce soot precursor concentrations but is primarily involved in intramolecular water elimination reactions. On the contrary, the fuel bound oxygen in methyl butanoate shortens the carbon chain of the soot precursors and promotes their oxidation, which reduces the total carbon available for soot formation.

The synthesized LaFeO3-XNX oxynitride was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) nitrogen adsorption, particle size distribution, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Nitrogen effect into the perovskite structure was confirmed by DRX. The structure refinement using the Rietveld method indicates that partial replacement of oxygen by nitrogen increases slightly the cell parameters of the LaFeO3 perovskite. FTIR analysis show that bands at 995 and 1070 cm(-1) in the oxynitrides spectra could be assigned to the stretching vibration modes of Fe-N bonds in the FeO6-XNX octahedral. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that LaFeO3-XNX oxynitride series start to decompose in air above 550 degrees C.During the decomposition it was found that some amount of nitrogen stays retained in the structure forming intermediate compounds. MS analysis of the gaseous products reveals the evolution of N-2 and NO, suggesting a complex reaction mechanism.To our knowledge, there are no reports on the synthesis and characterization of the LaFeO3-XNX oxynitrides.

Interruption of S-supply significantly reduced the content of sulfur, chlorophylls a + b and carotenoids, leaf area, density of stomatal and epidermal cells, transpiration rate and leaf water potential, while it increased the free proline content and stomatal diffusion resistance. An increase in S concentration in the nutrient medium from 1 to 3 mM did not significantly affect the tested parameters, except for an increase in leaf S content and a decrease of leaf water potential. Sulfur deficiency caused a pronounced decrease of the rate and quantum yield of photosynthetic oxygen evolution under non-photorespiratory conditions. This was partly the result of the diminished photochemical efficiency of photosystem II reaction centers. Less efficient excitation of PSII reaction centers is most probably the consequence of higher thermal energy dissipation in the reaction centers of S-starved plants. These data support that S nutrition is one of the factors regulating plant photosynthesis.									28	1	1	0	24	0	31			0190-4167	1532-4087		WOS:000088619700001		
J	Yu, Shan; Miettinen, Jyrki; Shao, Lei; Louhenkilpi, Seppo								Mathematical Modeling of Nitrogen Removal from the Vacuum Tank Degasser								STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				86	5			466	477		10.1002/srin.201400093				MAY 2015	2015	The removal of nitrogen from an industrial vacuum tank degasser depends on a series of operational parameters, steel composition, and contents of surface-active elements in liquid steel, e.g., oxygen and sulfur. The effect of some specific elements on nitrogen removal in the vacuum degasser has been (well) examined. Still, it is quite challenging to assess the overall effect of the whole steel composition on the process. The focus of the present work was to predict nitrogen removal from the vacuum degasser specially taking into account the multi-component effect of steel composition. An integrated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for simulating nitrogen (and hydrogen) removal in industrial vacuum tank degassers was therefore developed based on theories and methods that are relatively separate in the literature. In order to include the multi-component effect, the model is coupled with an in-house thermodynamics code that can be used to determine the activity coefficient of nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur as a function of steel composition and temperature. The code was verified by comparing the calculated activity coefficients against experimental measurements from various sources. Efforts were also put into developing an on-line use concept to control the nitrogen removal. The gas plume, flow field, and evolutions of nitrogen and hydrogen during vacuum treatment were predicted and the on-line concept was demonstrated by presenting two operating diagrams. The results showed that the final nitrogen content decreases with an increase in the chemical reaction rate constant and a decrease in the initial nitrogen content. By contrary, the final nitrogen content increases with a decrease in the chemical reaction rate constant and an increase in the initial nitrogen content. Finally, the operating diagrams were validated by industrial data and observations.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000354202500002

We here propose a statistical thermodynamic theory for electrochemical reactions, which is vital to investigate electrochemical reactions for non-equilibrium, quasi-equilibrium, and equilibrium. The theory utilizes a postulate that electric potential, time, and space are independent and orthogonal variables in extended phase spaces. It is an internal Gibbs energy transport theory for electrochemical reactions leading to the unification of non-equilibrium and equilibrium reactions, a non-equilibrium generalization beyond quasi-equilibrium theories for migration and diffusion, and the integration of diffusion and convection mechanisms. It predicts that there are current density gaps and broken discrete symmetries at the activation potential, time, and displacement. It provides the Nernst equation, the rate equation, and the spatial cross section of electrochemical reactions. The electrochemical theory demonstrates relationships among electrochemical reactions, thermodynamics, and statistical physics. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Although the three constituents are inactive, as-assembled ternary membranes yield superior HER performance with low overpotentials and high durability (<= 5 % activity loss over 100 h) at all pH values. The C adjacent to pyrrolic N in MHCF is the most active site and the induced directional interfacial electron transfer from CNTs to MHCF coupled with N-driven intramolecular electron transfer in MHCF optimizes Gibbs free energy for hydrogen adsorption (Delta G(H*)) near zero, while the polymer modulation enables local H+ enrichment in acidic media and enhanced water adsorption and activation in neutral and basic media.									35	2	0	0	2	0	35			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000486869200001	31424611

Endorsed by the unique 3D bicontinuous porous structure, they exhibit remarkable properties such as large surface area, high conductivity, efficient mass transport, and high catalytic activity, which render them as advanced nanomaterials with enormous potential for a variety of applications. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the development of dealloying and dealloyed nanoporous materials for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Beginning with an overview of the modern understanding of dealloying mechanisms, the unique structural and physical properties of dealloyed nanoporous materials are introduced. Then, we discuss the established dealloying techniques and how they enable the versatile fabrication of a diverse variety of nanoporous materials, ranging from unary metals and alloys to the latest high-entropy alloys and two-dimensional materials. Following that, the electrochemical applications of dealloyed nanoporous materials for fuel cells, supercapacitors, metal-ion batteries, alkali metal batteries, non-aqueous metal-oxygen batteries, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and electrocatalytic N-2 reduction are highlighted. Finally, we discuss remaining challenges in this field and offer perspectives on potential directions for future research.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2589-7780			WOS:000760446400001

This is especially feasible if the catalyst nanoparticles are large enough that they can be found and counted in post-SECCM scanning electron microscopy images. Evidently, this becomes impossible for very small nanoparticles and hence, a catalytic current measured in one landing zone of the SECCM droplet cannot be correlated to the exact number of catalyst particles. We show, that by introducing a ruler method employing a carbon nanoelectrode decorated with a countable number of the same catalyst particles from which the catalytic activity can be determined, the activity determined using SECCM from many spots can be converted in the intrinsic catalytic activity of a certain number of catalyst nanoparticles.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000686487500003

However, several challenges remain in the development of such promising devices, including slow kinetics of the cathodic reaction and undesirable deposition of metal oxide on air cathode. Herein, as a proof of concept, we show single-atom scale metal vacancy engineering in heteroatom-doped carbon cathode to enable high-performance zinc-air battery with reduced overpotential. Density functional theory calculations indicate that metal vacancy-induced pyridinic-N can tailor the electronic structure and thus facilitate the catalytic reaction. The single-atom dispersed Fe-N-C catalyst with optimized Fe vacancies shows improved reactivity and the facilitated chemisorption of oxygen intermediates in the actual battery operation is directly observed by in-situ X-ray diffraction characterization. Moreover, the in-situ observation also indicates the absence of zinc oxide, which can be ascribed to strong Lewis basicity created by pyridinic-N that effectively prevents the access of zincate ions with negative charge and thus enables non-deposition of zinc oxide. Applying this strategy, the rechargeable zinc-air battery shows high reversibility and stability over 1000 cycles with negligible voltage gap change of only 0.04 V. This work not only affords valuable insights but also opens up new perspectives to develop high-performance metal-air batteries.									24	1	0	0	2	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000533523300002

In the dark-adapted reaction center(s) (RC), the fluorescence decay kinetics of the antenna were measured at low-intensity picosecond pulsed excitation. To create a "closed" P680(+)Q (A) (-) state, RCs were illuminated by high-intensity actinic flash 8 ns prior to the measuring flash. The obtained data were approximated by the sum of two decaying exponents. It was found that the antennae fluorescence quenching efficiency by the oxidized photoactive pigment of RC P680(+) was about 1.5 times higher than that of the neutral P680 state. These results were confirmed by a single-photon counting technique, which allowed to resolve the additional slow component of the fluorescence decay. Slow component was assigned to the charge recombination of P680(+)Pheo(-) in PS II RC. Thus, for the first time, the ratio k (p) (+) /k (p) ae... 1.5 was found directly. The mechanism of the higher efficiency of non-photochemical quenching comparing to photochemical quenching is discussed.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000385248300026	27075994

The influence of annealing temperature in the range 1000-1200 degrees C in oxidizing ambient (O(2)) on the structural and optical properties has been studied. In spite of the known reactivity of rare earth silicates towards silicon, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry shows that undesired chemical reactions between the film and the substrate can be strongly limited by using rapid thermal treatments. Monosilicate and disilicate films crystallize at 1100 and 1200 degrees C, respectively, as shown by x-ray diffraction analysis; the crystalline structures have been identified in both cases. Moreover, photoluminescence (PL) measurements have demonstrated that the highest PL intensity is obtained for Er(2)Si(2)O(7) film annealed at 1200 degrees C. In fact, this treatment allows us to reduce the defect density in the film, in particular by saturating oxygen vacancies, as also confirmed by the increase of the lifetime of the PL signal.					15th International Winterschool on New Developments in Solid State Physics15th International Winterschool on New Developments in Solid State Physics	FEB 18-22, 2008FEB 18-22, 2008		Bad Hofgastein, GERMANYBad Hofgastein, GERMANY	12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0953-8984			WOS:000260311900024

The Sr content was chosen in the range of 2-8 mol%. These materials were prepared by the solid phase reaction of the oxides. It was found, from the experimental results, the tetragonality of the PMnN-PZT lattice and the Curie temperature decreased with Sr content; in the meantime, dielectric constant increased greatly. Dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and planar coupling factor (K-p) was proven to be dependent on sintering temperature. P-E curves of PMnN-PZT system exhibited some "pinched" shape instead of the normal square-like P-E loops, illustrating presence of the oxygen vacancies by reason of the preferable substitution of the B-sites ion.					3rd China International Conference on High-Performance Ceramics (CICC-3)3rd China International Conference on High-Performance Ceramics (CICC-3)	MAY 09-12, 2004MAY 09-12, 2004	Chinese Ceram Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Tsinghua UnivChinese Ceram Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Tsinghua Univ	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINAShenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	1	0	0	0	0	1			1013-9826		0-87849-959-8	WOS:000227051400051

We report here graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) embedded with transition metals as a new class of CO2 reduction catalysts in aqueous environment. Bimetallic (NiMn or NiCu)-C3N4 catalysts are found to be more efficient than their monometal counterparts due to metal synergistic effects, delivering high Faradic efficiency for CO evolution of around 90 % over a wide potential range (-0.6 V to - 0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) with a low overpotential of 0.39 V. The high activity originates from the atomic modification of g-C3N4 matrix with metal atoms. And g-C3N4 not only serves as a coordination framework but also provides a favorable local environment for CO2 reduction. The present study contributes to our understanding of structure and activity trends of this kind of materials, and points to strategies for the rational design of more efficient CO2 reduction catalysts.									41	2	0	0	2	0	42			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000521513300036

Hence, we designed a nanowire Co3O4@nickel foam (Co3O4-NW@NF) electrode to boost OER utilizing the locally enhanced interfacial Joule heating and electric field within the diffusion layer. Results show that the morphology of Co3O4@NF could be regulated in nanowires, nanosheets, and nanoclusters by controlling the doping amount of fluoride ions (F-). F- served as a complexing agent to regulate the rate of crystal nucleus, and then morphologies could be tuned. compared to others, nanowire structures have a much lower potential (298 mV vs. RHE, 10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope (48.11 mV dec(-1)). This better electrochemical performance was confirmed by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) that the (311) facet with oxygen vacancies of Co3O4 has a low onset potential (0.36 V) for the kinetic rate of OER. A much better mass transfer by the nanowire-enhanced interfacial Joule heating and electric field within the diffusion layer also accounted for superior OER activity, confirmed by COMSOL simulation. In a word, the design of the nanotip structure offers a novel way to boost the OER rate by enhancing electron transfer and mass transport simultaneously.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

BCN materials are recognized for adaptable electrical properties, outstanding mechanical behavior, exceptional chemical inertness, and high thermal stability, which make them advantageous for corresponding applications in harsh environments. In this article, we thoroughly summarize BCN material theory, growth, properties, and applications. Properties of BCN thin films depend on the composition and growth technique, which facilitates in developing BCN films prevailing between insulating BN and semimetallic graphite. Regarding this, the effects of synthesis parameters on various BCN properties are examined. Dry and wet etching, which are imperative for device processing, are explored. Prompted by the success of graphene, graphene-analogous BCN nanomaterials are being researched intensively due to their unique chemical and physical properties. This article highlights BCN nanomaterials, their synthesis in different dimensions, and properties with prospective applications. We focus on their energy applications in supercapacitors, batteries, oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction, water purification, and CO2 adsorption along with other biosensing applications. Performance of BCN nanomaterials is discussed and compared with the prevailing benchmark materials to present an evolutionary perspective of BCN nanomaterial progress. Finally, unresolved issues are highlighted, and future development opportunities are identified. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

And Pd is regarded as a ideal alternative catalyst due to its high stability and catalytic activity. In this work, we designed a facile method to prepare a highly efficient electrocatalyst in which ultrafine Pd nanoparticles are embedded into N-doped porous carbon nanosheets for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acid media. A series of products with different Pd quantities were in situ prepared in the absence of additional reductant and capping agents by varying the addition of PdCl2, while the morphology and the structural features of products through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and BET measurements show that Pd nanoparticles are embedded into N-doped porous carbon nanosheets. Obviously, the sample of Pd-NCs-3 demonstrate the best electrocatalytic activity and remarkable long-term stability among the series, which is superior to that of commercial Pd/C and comparable to that of commercial Pt/C for ORR in alkaline and acid media. The results provides a novel strategy for the rational development of cheap alternatives for platinum electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Here, we report the rational synthesis of Co9S8 nanoparticles embedded in N,S co-doped hollow carbon nanosheets (Co9S8/NSC) as highly efficient oxygen electrocatalysts. The catalyst is formed when a Co-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67), grown on a Zn-based ZIF (ZIF-8) template, is partially vulcanized following thioacetamide (TAA) and thermal treatment. The resulting catalyst, Co9S8/NSC-3, shows satisfactory bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in 0.1 M KOH, in which the half-wave potential (E-1/2) for the ORR is 0.82 V and the overpotential for the OER at 10 mA cm(-2) is just 350 mV. Furthermore, as the air electrode material in a practical demonstration of a rechargeable liquid zinc-air battery, Co9S8/NSC-3 exhibits promising battery performance with a high specific capacity of 804 mA h g(-1) and a pleasing charge/discharge cyclability of over 140 h at 10 mA cm(-2). The satisfactory activity of Co9S8/NSC-3 can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the Co9S8 nanoparticles with the N,S-doped hollow carbon nanosheet structure, resulting in an effective electrochemically active surface with fully exposed active sites that give fast catalytic kinetics.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000837394100001	35929497

While it was long assumed that a single heme biosynthetic pathway existed in nature, over the past decade, it has become clear that there are three distinct pathways among prokaryotes, although all three pathways utilize a common initial core of three enzymes to produce the intermediate uroporphyrinogen III. The most ancient pathway and the only one found in the Archaea converts siroheme to protoheme via an oxygen-independent four-enzyme-step process. Bacteria utilize the initial core pathway but then add one additional common step to produce coproporphyrinogen III. Following this step, Gram-positive organisms oxidize coproporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrin III, insert iron to make coproheme, and finally decarboxylate coproheme to protoheme, whereas Gram-negative bacteria first decarboxylate coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX and then oxidize this to protoporphyrin IX prior to metal insertion to make protoheme. In order to adapt to oxygen-deficient conditions, two steps in the bacterial pathways have multiple forms to accommodate oxidative reactions in an anaerobic environment. The regulation of these pathways reflects the diversity of bacterial metabolism. This diversity, along with the late recognition that three pathways exist, has significantly slowed advances in this field such that no single organism's heme synthesis pathway regulation is currently completely characterized.									146	3	0	0	113	0	149			1092-2172	1098-5557		WOS:000397488000006	28123057

Eleven different thin films, consisting of six monometallic and five bimetallic 2-ethylhexanoate complexes, were tracked as a function of photolysis time. Overlapping peaks in the infrared fingerprint region are readily discriminated using 2D-COS, enabling individual vibrational components to be used to distinguish whether carboxylate ligands are free/ionic or bound in a chelating, bridging, or monodentate fashion. This classification enables the decomposition mechanism to be tracked for all 11 samples, revealing that ligands bound in monodentate and bridging fashions are first converted to chelates before being lost as volatile products for all samples. The magnitude of the measured first-order rate constants for loss of chelated ligands is found to correlate linearly to the asymmetric stretching frequency of monodentate ligands but exhibits a V shape when plotted against the electronegativity of the metal center. We propose that loss of chelated ligands proceeds via C-O scission for highly electronegative transition metals but M-O scission for transition metals with low electronegativity. These results establish 2D-COS as a powerful tool to deconvolute and correlate individual components, enabling mechanistic analysis of complex chemical reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000620345400024	33507733

Although graphene and carbon nanotubes aerogels have shown excellent performances, their practical applications are severely limited by their high cost, complex preparation process and low production yield. As one class of carbon-rich natural resources, polysaccharides composed of C, H, O, have been considered as one more attractive precursors for the preparation of renewable, cost-effective and eco-friendly CAs due to their universal availability, renewability and low toxicity. As a class of carbon aerogels, polysaccharide-based carbon aerogels (PS-CAs) also possess high porosity, large surface area, excellent conductivity and good mechanical properties.Therefore, PS-CAs arc potential carbon materials applied in environmental remediat ion and the energy fields. This review highlights the fabrication of PS-CAs, including carbon aerogels, activated carbon aerogels, heteroatom-doped carbon aerogels and carbon aerogels composites, and their potential applications for environmental remediation and sustainable energy (conversion and storage). Following this, key challenges and future perspectives for polysaccharide-based carbon aerogel materials are also briefly discussed. This critical review expects to significantly promote the creation of a sustainable future by utilizing renewable and sustainable natural resources. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report an interface-engineered 2D-C3N4/NiFe layered double hydroxide (CN/ LDH) heterostructure that shows highly enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate with excellent long-term stability. The morphology and band gap structure of NiFe-LDH are precisely regulated by employing NH4F as a structure-directing agent, which enables a fine interfacial tuning via coupling with 2D-C3N4. The formation of a type II interface in CN/LDH enlarges the active surface area and promotes the charge separation efficiency, leading to an HER rate of 3087 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), which is 14 times higher than that of 2D-C3N4.

Here we show that a molten molybdate-assisted LiO extraction at 700 degrees C creates lattice-coherent but depth (r)-dependent Li1+x(r)M1-x(r)O2 particles with a Li-rich (X approximate to 0.2) interior, a Li-poor (X approximate to -0.05) surface and a continuous gradient in between. The gradient Li-rich single crystals eliminate the oxygen release to the electrolyte and, importantly, still allow stable oxygen redox contributions within. Both the metal valence states and the crystal structure are well maintained during cycling. The gradient HACR cathode displays a specific density of 843 Wh kg(-1) after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 808 Wh kg(-1) after 100 cycles at 1C, with very little oxygen release and consumption of electrolyte. This high-temperature immunization treatment can be generalized to leach other elements to avoid unexpected surface reactions in batteries.									148	9	0	0	6	0	150			2058-7546			WOS:000502574200019

At the first step, MOF-199 is synthesized via two distinct strategies; (1) hydrothermal (HT) and (2) electrochemical (EC). Next, the synthesized MOF-199 is used as a template in order to prepare Cu/NPCC by direct carbonization under N-2 atmosphere followed by galvanic replacement reaction of Cu metals by PdII ions. All the prepared materials are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements. The effect of synthesis method of MOF-199 on the electrocatalytic activity of the final product towards HER is investigated. The electrochemical measurements indicate that Cu-Pd/NPCC derived from the MOF prepared by EC method (Cu-Pd/NPCC/EC) exhibits an enhanced catalytic activity towards HER in H2SO4 solution than the Cu-Pd/NPCC/HT. This improvement may be attributed to using of supporting electrolyte in the preparation of Cu-Pd/NPCC/EC. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It has mainly relied on platinum-based electrocatalysts, but the chemical doping of carbon-based materials has proven to be a promising strategy for preparing metal-free alternatives. Nitrogen doping in particular provides a diverse range of nitrogen forms. Here, we introduce a new form of nitrogen doping moieties - sp-hybridized nitrogen (sp-N) atoms into chemically defined sites of ultrathin graphdiyne, through pericyclic replacement of the acetylene groups. The as-prepared sp-N-doped graphdiyne catalyst exhibits overall good ORR performance, in particular with regards to peak potential, half-wave potential and current density. Under alkaline conditions it was comparable to commercial Pt/C, and showed more rapid kinetics. And although its performances are a bit lower than those of Pt/C in acidic media they surpass those of other metal-free materials. Taken together, experimental data and density functional theory calculations suggest that the high catalytic activity originates from the sp-N dopant, which facilitates O-2 adsorption and electron transfer on the surface of the catalyst. This incorporation of chemically defined sp-N atoms provides a new synthetic route to high-performance carbon-based and other metal-free catalysts.									385	39	0	0	25	0	387			1755-4330	1755-4349		WOS:000442395200006	30082882

Herein, one ultralow-temperature solution reduction approach is developed to anchor atomically dispersed Pt atoms on carbon nanotubes (Pt-CNTs), which decelerates the diffusion rate of PtCl62- ion reached onto the car bon nanotubes and lowers the free energy of Pt atoms in the solution to reduce the probability of the Pt aggregation. The obtained Pt-CNTs exhibits a low overpotential of 41 mV@10 mA cm(-2) for HER in acidic media. The calculation results revealed that the improvement of the electrocatalytic activity is contributed by the interaction between CNTs and Pt atoms, which descreases the the Pt d band cneter referred to the Fermi level and lowers the Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption.

Because of the smaller lattice expansion and modified electron effect of the ultrathin Pt shells in core-shell AgPd@Pt nanoparticles relative to those in core-shell Ag@Pt counterparts, the d-band center of core-shell AgPd@Pt nanoparticles locates at a lower position, favorable for weakening the adsorption of hydrogen and promoting their electrocatalysis for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic medium. Specifically, the core-shell AgPd@Pt nanoparticles with an appropriate Pt shell thickness not only show the lowest overpotential of 15.8 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in comparison with 27 mV of core-shell Ag@Pt nanoparticles, and 35 mV of commercial Pt/C catalyst, but also possesses the highest mass activity (1092.6 A g(-1)) at the overpotential of 25 mV, which is 1.58 times higher than that of core-shell Ag@Pt nanoparticles (693.5 A g(-1)) and 6.74 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C (162 A g(-1)). Moreover, alloying Pd into Ag cores also endows the ultrathin Pt shells with excellent electrocatalytic durability for HER. The concept of both lattice strain and electronic engineering through a core-shell construction may provide guidance for designing other highly catalytic and cost-effective nanostructures for a myriad of electrochemical reactions.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000810028300001

Taking account of the strong chemical inertness of N2 and competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, it is necessary to explore a robust and stable photoelectrocatalyst. Herein, a robust p-type BiVO4 (p-BiVO4) photocathode is firstly reported for NRR under ambient conditions. Interestingly, V sites are proved as the mainly ideal active center for N2 adsorption/activation based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The ammonia evolution rate (VNH3:11.6 ? 10-8 mol h-1 cm- 2) and Faradaic efficiency (16.2%) were obtained at -0.1 V vs. RHE in 0.1 M Li2SO4 solution, outperforming most of the photoelectrocatalysts reported thus far. Moreover, the 1H nuclear magnetic resonance result confirmed that the source of N was completely from the feeding N2 gas. This work provided a new opportunity to tap the V-based photocathode in the field of PEC NRR.									23	1	0	0	2	0	23			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000641373700005

NPG has excellent conductivity and a porous structure, providing a huge active surface area for deposition of transition metal atoms and electrochemically active materials. Moreover, NPG materials display high intrinsic activity because of their crystallographic structural defects to catalyze hosts of electrochemical reactions, considered pertinent in clean energy technologies. Therefore, taking into account their superior specific and mass activity, they provide a versatile platform for developing high-performance catalysts for oxidation and reduction reactions, supercapacitors, and battery-type electrode materials for the assembly of high density electric energy storage devices. Initially, a full overview of the strategies used to build NPG structures and incorporate other metallic elements in the pore walls is presented. Afterward, the water-splitting parameters and performance of NPG catalysts for hydrogen generation are reviewed. Next, the possibility of using such porous materials as fuel cell electrodes is discussed. In short, the most recent advancements in the field paving the way for the preparation of advanced electrode materials meeting the most stringent requirements are reviewed, demonstrating the bright perspectives for innovation in the key area of energy conversion and storage.									7	0	1	0	1	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000630601400001

In this study, a new heterostructure catalyst (Ru/RuS2@N-rGO) with low crystallinity was fabricated by a simple and lowtemperature method for HER in alkaline solution, applying the Na2SO4 as S source and polypyrrole as N source. Optimizing through the controllable crystalline engineering and composition ratio of Ru and RuS2, the Ru/RuS2@N-rGO heterocatalyst at the calcining 500 degrees C revealed highly efficient HER activity with overpotential 18 mV at a current density 10 mA/cm(2) and remarkable stability for 24 h in 1.0 mol/L KOH. This work provides a facile and effective method in designing advanced electrocatalysts for HER in the alkaline electrolytes by synergistically structural and component modulations.

The influence of electron utilization pathways on photosystem I photochemistry in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803								RSC ADVANCES				12	23			14655	14664		10.1039/d2ra01295b				MAY 12 2022	2022	The capacity of cyanobacteria to adapt to highly dynamic photon flux and nutrient availability conditions results from controlled management and use of reducing power, and is a major contributing factor to the efficiency of photosynthesis in aquatic environments. The response to changing conditions includes modulating gene expression and protein-protein interactions that serve to adjust the use of electron flux and mechanisms that control photosynthetic electron transport (PET). In this regard, the photochemical activity of photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers can support balancing of cyclic (CEF) and linear electron flow (LEF), and the coupling of redox carriers for use by electron utilization pathways. Therefore, changes in the utilization of reducing power might be expected to result in compensating changes at PSI as a means to support balance of electron flux. To understand this functional relationship, we investigated the properties of PSI and its photochemical activity in cells that lack flavodiiron 1 catalyzed oxygen reduction activity (ORR1). In the absence of ORR1, the oxygen evolution and consumption rates declined together with a shift in the oligomeric form of PSI towards monomers. The effect of these changes on PSI energy and electron transfer properties was examined in isolated trimer and monomer fractions of PSI reaction centers. Collectively, the results demonstrate that PSI photochemistry is modulated through coordination with the depletion of electron demand in the absence of ORR1.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2046-2069		WOS:000796038000001	35702219

The apparent catalytic reactivity is highly dependent on the substituent R and the highest catalytic reactivity was obtained when R OH. The apparent turnover frequency (TOF) of the catalytic water oxidation by CAN with [Ir (III) (Cp*){4,4'-(OH) 2-2,2'-bipyridine} (H2O)](2+), which acts as a precatalyst, gradually increased during the reaction to reach the highest value among the Ir complexes. In the second run, the apparent TOF value was the highest from the beginning of the reaction. H-1 NMR and dynamic light scattering measurements for solutions after the first run indicated formation of insoluble nanoparticles, which exhibited a much higher catalytic reactivity as compared with iridium oxide prepared by a conventional method. The 4,4'-R2-2,2'-bipyridine ligand was also efficiently oxidized by CAN up to CO2 only when R OH. TG/DTA and XPS measurements of nanoparticles produced after the water oxidation suggested that the nanoparticles were composed of iridium hydroxide with a small amount of carbonaceous residue. Thus, iridium hydroxide nanoparticles act as an excellent catalyst for the water oxidation by CAN.									125	0	0	0	12	0	125			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000299502300021

Combining Pt with transition metals and reducing the particle size of Pt-based catalysts are two effective strategies to improve their performances toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, one-dimensional nanostructures with interconnected porous texture are ideal supports in electrocatalysis. Herein, ZIF-67 were embedded into electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to obtain hierarchical porous carbon nanofibers which were used as supports to anchor sub-5 nm octahedral Pt-Cu nanocrystals. The as-prepared nanocomposites exhibit outstanding HER performance in acidic medium with an overpotential of only 13 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and superior stability over 10,000 cycles. This outperforms commercial Pt/C and most supported catalysts reported so far. The remarkable HER properties may be mainly attributed to the unique structures of nitrogen-doped porous carbon nanofibers and Pt-Cu nanocrystals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Results indicated that the CoNiP/NCNT catalysts had the advantages of low overpotential and high durability. The sodium hypophosphite content was a crucial factor affecting the performance of the catalysts. The optimized CoNiP/NCNT catalyst with an appropriate content of the phosphorization agent (0. 2 g sodium hypophosphite/0. 02 g CoNiO2/NCNT) exhibited the best performance with an onset-overpotential of 44 mV and an overpotential of 75 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.5 M H2SO4.

Here, an in situ topotactic reduction method to synthesize ultrathin 2D Ni-Mo alloy nanosheets for electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution is reported. Due to its ultrathin structure and tailored composition, the as-synthesized Ni-Mo alloy shows an overpotential of 35 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), along with a Tafel slope of 45 mV decade(-1), demonstrating a comparable intrinsic activity to state-of-art commercial Pt/C catalyst. Besides, the vertically aligned assemble structure of the 2D NiMo nanosheets on conductive substrate makes the electrode "superaerophobic," thus leading to much faster bubble releasing during HER process and therefore shows faster mass transfer behavior at high current density as compared with drop drying Pt/C catalyst on the same substrate. Such in situ topotactic conversion finds a way to design and fabricate low-cost, earth-abundant non-noble metal based ultrathin 2D nanostructures for electrocatalytic issues.									123	10	0	0	10	0	124			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000414374700002	28891263

Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high-energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass-forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in situ formed in an Fe-Ni-B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free-standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen-evolving overpotential of 214 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 32.4 mV dec(-1), and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state-of-the-art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid-solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass-forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic-level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost-effective electrocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000865567600001	36101917

In this study, a Pt-loaded KSr2Nb5O15 composite, as a novel photocatalyst, is reported for gaseous ethylene photo-oxidation, performing excellent PCO activity. Tungsten bronze-type KSr2Nb5O15 (KSNO) with surface oxygen vacancies is prepared by a facile and low-cost molten salt synthesis method at 1200 degrees C for 6 h and a possible morphology evolution process was proposed. Pt was loaded on KSNO through a facile photodeposition method. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between the Pt nanoparticles and the oxygen-deficient KSNO support is beneficial for superior photocatalytic efficiency and stability toward ethylene photo-oxidation. What's more, the structure and charge transfer path in the synthesized photocatalysts were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution electron microscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR).									20	0	0	0	1	0	20			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000411232100009

The core shell devices were fabricated by atomic layer deposition of amorphous Ta2O5 onto nanostructured Si and subsequent nitridation to crystalline Ta3N5. Nanostructuring with a thin shell of Ta3N5 results in a 10-fold improvement in photocurrent compared to a planar device of the same thickness. In examining thickness dependence of the Ta3N5 shell from 10 to 70 nm, superior photocurrent and absorbed-photon-to-current efficiencies are obtained from the thinner Ta3N5 shells, indicating minority carrier diffusion lengths on the order of tens of nanometers. The fabrication of a heterostructure based on a semiconducting, n-type Si core produced a tandem photoanode with a photocurrent onset shifted to lower potentials by 200 mV. CoTiOx and NiOx water oxidation cocatalysts were deposited onto the Si Ta3N5 to yield active photoanodes that with NiOx retained 50-60% of their maximum photocurrent after 24 h chronoamperometry experiments and are thus among the most stable Ta3N5 photoanodes reported to date.									83	4	0	0	10	0	83			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000389963200037	27960454

A simple synthetic strategy was employed and fine-tuned to obtain different morphologies of CoWO4 whose urchin-shaped variant gave exciting activity toward BOR. An early and quite negative onset potential of -1.14 V was observed giving a maximum obtainable specific current density of 105.3 mA mg(-1). The synthesized variants were investigated in depth by various electrochemical measurements and assessed in light of previous reports toward BOR activity. Hydrodynamic studies were also performed to ascertain the nature of these static electrochemical measurements. Quantitative assessment of the evolved H-2, a prominent competitive reaction to BOR, was performed suggesting minimal interference. The probable origin of such morphology-dependent activity was subsequently studied in detail by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis, revealing nanometric structures in the urchin-like variant, which enhance the obtainable BOR activity.									15	0	0	0	1	0	15			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000472683300020	31117428

In addition, aerobic biological experiments were designed as short- and long-term experiments where the final pH was controlled at similar to 2.7 and 2.2, respectively. Due to the slower kinetics of abiotic sulfide oxidation, the aerobic abiotic experiments were only conducted as long term with a final pH of similar to 2.7. The delta S-34(SO4) values from both the biological and abiotic anaerobic experiments indicated a small but significant sulfur isotope fractionation (similar to-0.7 parts per thousand) in contrast to no significant fractionation observed from any of the aerobic experiments. Relative percentages of the incorporation of water-derived oxygen and dissolved oxygen (O-2) to sulfate were estimated, in addition to the oxygen isotope fractionation between sulfate and water, and dissolved oxygen. As expected, during the biological and abiotic anaerobic experiments all of the sulfate oxygen was derived from water. The percentage incorporation of water-derived oxygen into sulfate during the oxidation experiments by O-2 varied with longer incubation and lower pH, but not due to the presence or absence of bacteria. These percentages were estimated as 85%, 92% and 87% from the short-term biological, long-term biological and abiotic control experiments, respectively. An oxygen isotope fractionation effect between sulfate and water (epsilon O-18(SO4)-H2O) of similar to 3.5 parts per thousand was determined for the anaerobic (biological and abiotic) experiments. This measured epsilon(18)O(SO4)2--H2O value was then used to estimate the oxygen isotope fractionation effects (epsilon(18)O(SO4)2-O-2) between sulfate and dissolved oxygen in the aerobic experiments which were -10.0 parts per thousand, -10.8%, and -9.8 parts per thousand, for the short-term biological, long-term biological and abiotic control experiments, respectively. Based on the similarity between delta O-18(SO4), values in the biological and abiotic experiments, it is suggested that delta O-18(SO4) values cannot be used to distinguish biological and abiotic mechanisms of pyrite oxidation. The results presented here suggest that Fe(III),,q is the primary oxidant for pyrite at pH < 3, even in the presence of dissolved oxygen, and that the main oxygen source of sulfate is water-oxygen under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

Herein, a new 2D cobalt phosphide/nickelcobalt phosphide (CoP/NiCoP) hybrid nanosheet network is proposed, supported on an N-doped carbon (NC) matrix as a highly efficient and durable pH-universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalyst. It is derived from topological transformation of corresponding layer double hydroxides and graphitic carbon nitride. This 2D CoP/NiCoP/NC catalyst exhibits versatile HER electroactivity with very low overpotentials of 75, 60, and 123 mV in 1 m KOH, 0.5 m H2SO4, and 1 m PBS electrolytes, respectively, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. Such impressive HER performance of the hybrid electrocatalyst is mainly attributed to the collective effects of electronic structure engineering, strong interfacial coupling between CoP and NiCoP in heterojunction, an enlarged surface area/exposed catalytic active sites due to the 2D morphology, and conductive NC support. This method is believed to provide a basis for the development of efficient 2D electrode materials with various electrochemical applications.									203	11	0	0	10	0	205			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000458339800016

Herein, the epitaxial growth of the XMoO4 (X = Ni, Co, Fe) nanosheets on the hexagonal MoO2 nanoplates are carried out. The preoxidation of MoO2 nanoplate is fatal to the epitaxial growth of a nanosheets array on MoO2 nanoplates. The hierarchical heterostructure of the vertically aligned NiMo nanosheets on MoO2 nanoplate (NiMo/MoO2) is well-maintained in the process of in situ topotactic reduction transformation from NiMoO4 center dot xH(2)O/MoO2. Attributing it to the rich electroactive sites from nanosheets array, together with the intrinsic electrocatalytic performance of NiMo alloy, the as-engineered NiMo/MoO2 as electrocatalyst exhibits admirable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a small onset potential of -12 mV vs RHE (1 mA cm(-2)) and a tafel value of 43.6 mV dec(-1) at alkaline media. Furthermore, the obtained CoMoO4/MoO2 possesses excellent oxygen evolution performance, which is verified by an ultralow overpotential of 230 mV@10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope (51 mV dec(-1)), and robust durability. The developed NiMo/MoO2 and CoMoO4/MoO2 electrocatalysts are assembled into an alkaline electrolyzer, which affords a cell potential of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm(-2), as well as outstanding operational durability, which is superior to the typically constructed 20 wt % Pt/C-RuO2 system (1.59 V at 10 mA cm(-2)). Hence, the universal strategy using MoO2 nanoplates as Mo source and epitaxial substrate may be extended to explore and construct economical and superior Mo-based electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.									11	0	0	0	0	0	11			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000557854700034	32631054

However, the separation of carbon dots from the reaction system is always a cumbersome process, which may limit their applications in photocatalysis. Herein, we report the synthesis of a graphene quantum dot with CO2-switchable reversible phase transfer performance via a facile surface functionalization approach. The mechanism of this hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity alteration involves the protonation-deprotonation transformation and reversible formation of hydrophilic bicarbonate salts when CO2 is bubbled and removed. Then, the obtained graphene quantum dot was utilized as a visible-light photocatalyst for the oxidative coupling of amines. Our photocatalyst demonstrates excellent catalytic efficiency with both high reaction conversion and selectivity. Furthermore, the proposed graphene quantum dot could be recycled via a simple CO2 bubbling method.									19	1	0	0	0	0	19			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000531408100017	32026910

In this regard, the crystalline phase-dependent electrocatalytic activity of materials has been extensively studied for reactions such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, etc. But such comprehensive studies for evaluating the phase-dependence of electrochemical biosensing have not been undertaken. Herein, three crystalline phases (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-) of iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) have been synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic and microscopy techniques. Electrochemical studies revealed their high sensitivity and selectivity towards dopamine (DA) detection. Amongst the three electrocatalysts, beta-FeOOH shows the highest sensitivity (337.15 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) and the lowest detection limit (0.56 mu M). The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of beta-FeOOH, as compared to that of alpha- and gamma-FeOOH, was attributed to its higher active site percentage and facile electrode kinetics. Furthermore, theoretical studies probed into the DA-FeOOH interactions by evaluating the charge transfer characteristics and hydrogen adsorption energies of the three phases to support the experimental findings.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000693596900001	34494039

This huge gap could now be remedied by introducing a sulfite into the aqueous synthesis, which is believed to resemble an electroless plating mechanism, giving rise to a colloid of Pt-M (M=Ni, Co, Fe) alloy nanowires with an ultrasmall thickness (ca. 2.6 nm) in a high yield. The sulfite also leads to the formation of surface M-S bonds and thus atomic-level Pt/M-S(OH) interfaces for greatly boosted hydrogen evolution kinetics under alkaline conditions. An activity of 75.3 mA cm(-2) has been achieved with 3 mu g of Pt in 1 M KOH at an overpotential of 70 mV, which is superior to previously reported catalysts.									95	6	0	0	4	0	95			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000442846300033	30010224

It is established that IIPL of the illuminated samples rises with time more rapidly for the etched samples than for the untreated ones. The luminescence efficiency of the unilluminated samples practically does not change. The mechanism of the light effect on sample photoluminescence can be related to an increase of the ambient air ionicity, which is favorable to the reaction of atmospheric oxygen with silicon during the PS surface passivation and the oxide formation. The influence of HF etching duration on sample IIPL is also studied. The effect of HF on the luminescent properties depends on the treatment time and the initial intensity of sample photoluminescence. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

As the starting step, hydrogen production is a critical technique for the practical application of hydrogen-related technologies. Solar-driven water splitting is considered one of the cleanest methods for hydrogen production because solar power is abundant and clean, and the products are only hydrogen and oxygen. Consequently, strategies to increase the efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen conversion have been widely explored. Based on the basic requirements, loading of co-catalysts for photocatalysis is emerging as an effective method to improve the efficiency of solar-driven water splitting. In this review, we shall systematically discuss the recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) materials, including graphene, 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and MXenes, for their application as co-catalysts in photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical H-2 evolution. It is noted that highly efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by electrocatalysis can be used as superior co-catalysts for photocatalysis. Therefore, various methods to improve the HER activity of co-catalysts, such as phase-control, doping, defect engineering, hybridization, and functionalization, have been adopted to increase the photocatalytic performances of decorated photocatalysts, which are also systematically discussed. Through a comprehensive literature review, we summarize and propose this concept, that is, "electrocatalysts can be used as co-catalysts in photocatalysis for the improvement of solar-driven H-2 evolution". We believe that this concept will shed light on the development of technologies in photocatalytic hydrogen production for practical applications. At the same time, we trust that efficient, inexpensive and stable co-catalysts will be designed and fabricated not only to promote the efficiency of solar-driven hydrogen production on a large scale, but also to be beneficial for other catalytic processes.									44	2	0	0	3	0	46			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000590158400007

The results show that the addition of tetravalent cations M (M = Ti4+, Sn4+, Hf4+ and Zr4+) into CeO2 significantly enhances the O-2 evolution activity. The O-2 production at 1400 degrees C increases as follows: CeO2 (2.5 ml/g) < Ce0.75Zr0.25O2, (6.5 ml/g) < Ce0.75Hf0.25O2 (7.2 ml/g) < Ce0.8Sn0.2O2 (11.2 ml/g) < Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 (13.2 ml/g). The corresponding CO production is increased from 4.5 ml/g for CeO2 up to 10.6 ml/g for Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 synthesized by solution combustion method. For Ce0.75Hf0.25O2 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 synthesized by hydrothermal method, steady-state CO and O-2 production with a ratio of near 2 occurs simultaneously when the temperature exceeds 1100 degrees C and we define the phenomena as "one step thermochemical CO2 splitting reaction". Further investigations for one step thermochemical CO2 splitting with both CeO2 and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 as catalysts and blank reaction tube as reference from 1200 degrees C to 1400 degrees C are also performed. 16.8 ml/h of CO was produced for 0.5 g of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 at 1400 degrees C which indicates that one step reaction may be a promising way for CO2 reduction. For Ce0.8Ti0.2O2 and Ce0.8Sn0.2O2, although the O-2 production is increased several times as compared to CeO2, the CO generation activity is still low due to the formation of Ce2Ti2O7 and Ce2Sn2O7 after the high temperature reduction reaction. The doping of trivalent cations M (M = La3+, Y3+ and Sm3+) into ceria has negative effect both on the O-2 evolution activity and the CO production. The estimated activation energy for the reduction step of Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 is much lower than that of CeO2 and Ce0.85La0.15O2-delta. The CO generation reaction of CeO2, Ce0.85La0.15O2-delta and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2-C (synthesized by solid solution combustion method) is a surface limited reaction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, a NaCl-assisted exfoliation approach was developed to synthesize three-dimensional (3D) nitrogen doped hierarchical porous carbons (NHPCs) by the pyrolysis of a ZIF-8 polyhedron. At high temperature, NaCl crystals become a molten salt which not only serves as a template wrapping ZIF-8 derived carbon but also as an intercalating agent penetrating through the carbon via capillarity to promote the formation of nanosheets and mesopores and prevent the aggregation of nanosheets. The morphology, graphitization degree and nitrogen type of the resulting carbons are effectively controlled by tuning the NaCl/ZIF-8 mass ratio and pyrolysis temperature. The as-prepared optimal carbons show an intertwined nanosheet structure with rich micro- and mesopores, high surface area, suitable graphitization degree and nitrogen type. Benefiting from these desirable features, the optimal NHPCs exhibit excellent ORR electrocatalytic performances, much better than Pt/C, and also show high capacity and outstanding long-term discharge stability in Zn-air batteries. This work provides a simple and appealing method to prepare hierarchical porous structured carbon materials, and has a great potential to be extended to other MOFs for energy-related applications.									79	7	0	0	5	0	81			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000439389100015

The formation of excessive hydrogen (H-2:O-2 >> 2) in the initial stages of illumination demonstrates oxidation of Ni(OH)(2) to NiOOH (nickel oxyhydroxide), with the latter catalyzing water oxidation. A disproportionation reaction of Ni and NiOOH, yielding Ni(OH)(2) with residual embedded Ni, occurs when illumination is discontinued, which explains repetitive transients in (excess) hydrogen and oxygen formation when illumination is reinitiated.									65	3	0	0	1	0	65			2155-5435			WOS:000395726500013	28405491

In this work a gold electrode surface is monitored by operando surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy during typical discharge and charge cycling. During discharge, we observe the precipitation of stable and reversible lithium superoxide (LiO2), in contrast to reports that suggest it is a mere intermediate in the formation of lithium peroxide (Li2O2). Some LiO2 is further reduced to Li2O2 producing a coating of insulating discharge products that renders the gold electrode inactive. Upon charging, a superficial layer of these species (similar to 1 nm) are preferentially oxidized at low overpotentials (<0.6 V), leaving residual products in poor contact with the electrode surface. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is also used to distinguish between LiO2 and Li2O2 products using frequency-dependent responses and to correlate their reduction and oxidation potentials to the accepted mechanism of Li2O2 formation. These operando and in situ studies of the oxygen electrode interface, coupled with ex situ characterization, illustrate that the composition of discharge products and their proximity to the catalytic surface are important factors in the reversibility of Li-O-2 cells.									55	2	0	0	2	0	56			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000344978200080	25318060

The samples of SrTiO3(100) doped with 0.06 at. % and 0.13 at. % of iron were electroreduced at low pressure (10(-8) mbar) and elevated temperature (250 degrees C) using a DC voltage of 200 V. This led to the migration of oxygen vacancies and subsequent electrocoloration of the samples, which was confirmed by optical analysis and electrical measurements. Evolution of the color front was compared with finite element calculations of electric potential indicating good agreement. Both macroscopic and nanoscopic measurements showed insulator-metal transition at several hundreds of seconds (0: 06% Fe) and resistive switching behavior. We found that the resistive switching is clearly modified by the oxygen partial pressure of the ambient atmosphere. Moreover, after electroreduction, in the region between the electrodes, stripes can be found following simple crystallographic directions connected with the extended defects and easy diffusion paths also observed in the single crystals of undoped strontium titanate. Furthermore, migration of negatively charged oxygen ions towards the anode led to the formation of oxygen bubbles trapped between the surface of the crystal and the electrode.

The microstructures of the catalysts were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results clearly showed the successful doping of nitrogen or/and boron. The cyclic voltammetry (CV), Tafel, linear scanning voltammetry (LSV) tests confirmed that the onset potentials and peak current intensities of oxygen reduction increased in the sequence of pure CNT < N-CNT < B-CNT < N,B-CNT. The rotating disc electrode (RDE) tests proved the electron transfer number of oxygen reduction increased with the doping of nitrogen, boron and co-doping of nitrogen and boron. The N,B-CNT is a promising catalyst for oxygen reduction. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Fork, DC								Charles Stacy French: A tribute								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				49	1			91	101		10.1007/BF00029431				JUL 1996	1996	Charles Stacy French, one of the great men of photosynthesis research, died on 13 October 1995. He received his PhD at Harvard University where he associated with William Arnold, Caryl Haskins, later president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Pei-Sung Tang. He did early work on the photosynthesis of photosynthetic bacteria with Robert Emerson and later with Otto Warburg. French worked for three years with James Franck in Chicago. His associates there included Hans Gaffron, Robert Livingston, Warren Butler and Roderick Clayton. After spending three years at the University of Minnesota he became the director of the Department of Plant Biology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and remained there until he retired in 1973. French's research career at the Carnegie Institution was marked by the development of novel and ingenious pieces of equipment such as the French pressure cell used to prepare chloroplast particles to measure partial reactions of photosynthesis. He developed the first recording fluorescence spectrophotometer and demonstrated efficient energy transfer between certain photosynthetically-active pigments, a spectrophotometer that measured the first derivative of absorbance, as well as a novel analog computer to show that complex absorption curves in living plants are produced by a number of distinct forms of chlorophyll occurring in vivo. French used the Blinks rate-measuring oxygen electrode to measure action spectra of oxygen evolution by photosynthesis automatically. He and Jack Myers did some of the pioneering work on the Emerson effect showing the necessary cooperation of two photosystems in photosynthesis. French used the Carnegie Institution's fellowship program to bring large numbers of scientists from around the world to his laboratory. When Stacy French died in 1995, the field of photosynthesis lost one of its great and early pioneers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-8595			WOS:A1996VT61800010

In this study, cobalt phosphide (CoP) nanosheet was integrated on the nanoporous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) electrode by using the hydrothermal method. The introduction of CoP significantly improved the PEC performance of the photoanode, with a photocurrent up to 4.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (versus RHE) under simulated 100 mW cm(-2) irradiation, a 3-fold enhancement over that obtained by the bare BiVO4. The BiVO4+CoP photoanode exhibited an impressive early onset of water oxidation, with a more than 220 mV cathodic shift of the onset potential, superior to the typical Co3O4 and Co-Pi cocatalysts-modified BiVO4 photoanode. Systematic studies show that the improvement in PEC performance by CoP is mainly due to the restraint of surface charge recombination and increase in photovoltage.									27	0	0	0	1	0	27			2168-0485			WOS:000455288800081

An in situ Raman spectroscopy system was applied to characterize the evolution of char structure. Three different ranks of Chinese coals were deashed first and pyrolyzed to chars before experiment. In catalytic pyrolysis of coal char, the release of CO proved that reactions occurred between K2CO3 and char and the release of a small amount of CO2 was connected with the oxygen content. In situ Raman spectra results showed that the char structure order decreased with rising temperature for the production of an intermediate. During the gasification process, the char structure order decreased first and then increased, attributed to the evaporation of K at high temperature. The ex situ data revealed that the intermediate did not exist at room temperature. For better understanding of the true form of chars at high temperature, an in situ Raman spectrometer is necessary.									22	1	0	0	0	0	22			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000426015000034		
J	Xiao, Yao; Liu, Wengang; Zhang, Zhou; Liu, Jian								Controllable synthesis for highly dispersed ruthenium clusters confined in nitrogen doped carbon for efficient hydrogen evolution								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				571				205	212		10.1016/j.jcis.2020.03.048				JUL 1 2020	2020	Modulating the size and dispersion of metal particles is highly desirable in nanocatalysis. Herein highly dispersed ruthenium clusters confined in nitrogen-doped carbon (RuNC) were synthesized by a one-pot pyrolysis of Ru(phen)(3) organometallic compounds and glucose. The size of the Ru clusters was finely controlled at a cluster level (1.7 nm) to expose more catalytic active sites. The interaction between the Ru clusters and N species not only facilitated the uniform dispersion, but also prevented the aggregation of Ru clusters. This cluster-level RuNC manifested extraordinary catalytic performance towards the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and was comparable to or even better than a commercial Pt/C catalyst in basic and acidic media, respectively. Moreover, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was demonstrated that the N dopants in the carbon framework efficiently tailored the charge density distribution of the Ru centres and promoted the adsorption of H* on the catalyst, thus contributing to the high catalytic activity.

The resulting cross linked 33-kDa protein rebound to urea/NaCl-washed PSII membranes, which stabilized the binding of manganese as effectively as the untreated 33-kDa protein, In contrast, the oxygen evolution was not restored by binding of the cross-linked protein, indicating that the binding and manganese stabilizing capabilities of the 33-kDa protein are retained but its reactivating ability is lost by intramolecular cross-linking of the protein, From measurements of CD spectra at high temperatures, the secondary structure of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein was found to be stabilized against heat treatment at temperatures 20 degrees C higher than that of the untreated 33-kDa protein, suggesting that structural flexibility of the 33-kDa protein was much decreased by the intramolecular cross-linking, The rigid structure is possibly responsible for the loss of the reactivating ability of the 33-kDa protein, which implies that binding of the 33-kDa protein to PSII is accompanied by a conformational change essential for the reactivation of oxygen evolution. Peptide mapping, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectroscopic analysis of protease-digested products of the intramolecularly cross-linked 33-kDa protein revealed that cross-linkings occurred between the amino group of Lys(48) and the carboxyl group of Glu(246), and between the carboxyl group of Glu(10) and the amino group of Lys(14). These cross-linked amino acid residues are thus closely associated with each other through electrostatic interactions.									61	3	1	0	56	0	64			0021-9258			WOS:000072115000049	9468521

The polyoxometalate, Cs-3[alpha-PW11O39-{cis-Pt(NH3)(2)}(2)]center dot 8H(2)O (Cs-1), afforded by a stoichiometric reaction of mono-lacunary Keggin polyoxotungstate with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) in water, followed by crystallization from water, was obtained as analytically pure, homogeneous, yellow crystals. The compound Cs-1 was characterized by elemental analysis, thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-visible spectroscopy, solution H-1 and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and X-ray crystallography. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis revealed that the two cis-platinum(II) moieties, [cis-Pt(NH3)(2)](2+), were coordinated each to two oxygen atoms in a mono-vacant site of [alpha-PW11O39](7-) with asymmetric configuration, resulting in an overall C-1 symmetry. Furthermore, hydrogen evolution from an EDTA center dot 2Na (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt) aqueous solution under visible-light irradiation (>= 400 nm) was achieved by using polyoxoanion 1 and titanium dioxide.									25	0	0	0	2	0	25			1477-9226			WOS:000307018900035	22714024

In the current study, a novel concept is presented to achieve it, which is a different approach from familiar electrochemical measurements. To prove this concept, we prepared two nanocarbon materials, whose ORR activities were tested and compared via macroscale cyclic and linear sweep voltammetry. Next, considering the electrochemical potential of ORR and the band-edge position of semiconductors, we chose single-crystalline Ge as the substrate on which the single-sheet nanocarbons were dispersed. We found that etched hollows formed under the loaded nanocarbons after immersing the nanocarbon/Ge sample into O-2-containing water. The histogram analysis of the hollows represented the difference in catalytic activities to promote Ge etching between the used nanocarbons, and the corresponding trends agreed qualitatively with the electrochemical measurements.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2162-8769	2162-8777		WOS:000778395000001

In contrast to previously reported MoS2-based catalysts targeting only a single or few of these characteristics, the all-in-one MoS2 catalyst prepared herein features all of the above active site types. During synthesis, the intercalation of in situ generated NH3 molecules into MoS2 sheets affords ammoniated MoS2 (A-MoS2) that predominantly comprises 1T-MoS2 and exhibits an expanded interlayer spacing. The subsequent reduction of A-MoS2 results in the removal of intercalated NH3 and H2S to form an all-in-one MoS2 with multifunctional active sites mentioned above (R-MoS2) that exhibits electrocatalytic HER performance in alkaline media superior to those of all previously reported MoS2-based electrocatalysts. In particular, a hybrid MoS2/nickel foam catalyst outperforms commercial Pt/C in the practically meaningful high-current region (>25 mA cm(-2)), demonstrating that R-MoS2-based materials can potentially replace Pt catalysts in practical alkaline HER systems.									230	4	0	0	15	0	229			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000431961600020	29603427

Herein, ultra-small non-crystalline CuxP nanodots (CuxP-ND) as an efficient H-2-evolution cocatalyst were coupled on the TiO2 surface via a simple triethanolamine (TEOA)-assisted photodeposition strategy. Owing to the initially uniform anchoring of the Cu(TEOA)(2+) precursor on the TiO2 surface, the final CuxP nanodots show a very small size of 2-5 nm and are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the photocatalyst. The obtained CuxP-ND/TiO2 photocatalysts displayed a significantly enhanced ultraviolet-light H-2-production activity and the CuxP-ND/TiO2(1 wt%) sample displayed a maximum hydrogen-production rate of 93.5 mu mol h(-1) with an apparent quantum efficiency of 7.7%, which is a 30-fold increase compared to bare TiO2. The boosted hydrogen generation can be ascribed to the fact that the ultra-small non-crystalline CuxP nanodots can not only induce the formation of a built-in electric field to improve the rapid transfer of photogenerated electrons, but also provide interfacial hydrogen-production sites to dramatically enhance the H-2-generation rate. These new non-crystalline CuxP nanodots with a green and facile preparation procedure can pave a new way to exploit efficient co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.									25	5	0	0	2	0	25			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000590410200027

Tracking the phase transformation and evolution of true active sites is of great significance for the development of self-reconstructed electrocatalysts. Here, the optimized atomic sulfur-doped bismuth nanobelt (S-Bi) is fabricated via an electrochemical self-reconstruction evolved from Bi2S3. Advanced technologies have demonstrated that the nonmetallic S atoms have been doped into the lattice Bi frame, leading to the reconstruction of local electronic structure of Bi. The as prepared S-Bi nanobelt exhibits a remarkable NH3 generation rate of 10.28 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and Faradaic efficiency of 10.48%. Density functional theory calculations prove that the S doping can significantly lower the energy barrier of the rate-determining step and enlarge the N N bond for further dissociation toward N-2 fixation. This work not only establishes insights into the evolution process of electrochemically derived self-reconstruction but also unravels the root of the N-2 reduction reaction mechanism associated with the atomic nonmetal dopants.									16	2	0	0	0	0	17			1948-7185			WOS:000518706000021	32048849

Specifically, the synthesis of NCNT is achieved by the calcination of graphene oxide-coated polystyrene spheres with Fe3+, Co2+ and melamine adsorbed, during which graphene oxide is transformed into carbon nanotubes and simultaneously nitrogen is doped into the graphitic structure. The NPC/FeCo@NCNT is demonstrated to be an efficient and durable bifunctional catalyst for oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It only needs an overpotential of 339.5 mV to deliver 10 mA cm(-2) for OER and an onset potential of 0.92 V to drive ORR. Its bifunctional catalytic activities outperform those of the composite catalyst Pt/C + RuO2 and most bifunctional catalysts reported. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations have demonstrated that the interplay between FeCo NPs and NCNT and the presence of N,P-codoped carbon structure play important roles in increasing the catalytic activities of the NPC/FeCo@NCNT. More impressively, the NPC/FeCo@NCNT can be used as the air-electrode catalyst, improving the performance of rechargeable liquid and flexible all-solid-state zinc-air batteries.									54	0	0	0	1	0	54				2198-3844		WOS:000629229500001	34026452

The dissolution of magnetite seems to be related to its transformation to hematite by oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+. The transformation of magnetite to hematite occurs along {111} planes, and results in the development of hematite domains along {111} that are parallel to the foliation. The difference in volume created by the transformation of magnetite to hematite and the shear stress acting on the interphase boundaries allow fluids to migrate along these planes. The dissolution of magnetite involves the hydrolyzation of the Fe2+-O bonds at interphase boundaries of high normal stress. The high fugacity of oxygen in the fluid phase promotes the reaction of Fe2+ (in solution) with oxygen. Fe2+ ions oxidize to Fe3+ and precipitate as hematite platelets with their longest axes oriented parallel to the direction of maximum stretching. The transformation of magnetite to hematite during deformation plays an important role in the fabric evolution of the iron formation rocks. The transformation along {111} creates planes of weakness that facilitate fracturing. The fracturing plus the dissolution result in a reduction of magnetite grain size, and the oriented precipitation results in layers of hematite platelets. These processes produce a new fabric characterized by a penetrative foliation and lineation.									75	3	0	0	4	2	78			0263-4929			WOS:000073388200007

The studies clearly show that when we substitutes an atom of oxygen in 2-[4-(2-chlorobenzyl)-3-methyl-6-oxopyridazin-1(6H)-yl]acetohydrazide (P-1) by an atom of sulphur to obtain 2-[4-(2-chlorobenzyl)-3-methyl-6-thiooxopyridazin-1(6H)yl]acetohydrazide (P-2), the inhibition efficiency increases from 15 to 95% at 10(-4) M. The inhibition efficiency increases with the increase of inhibitor concentration to reach 99% at 2.5 x 10(-4) M of P-2. Potentiodynamic polarisation studies show that pyridazine derivatives are cathodic-type inhibitors in 0.5 M H2SO4 and these compounds act on the cathodic reaction without changing the mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction. The inhibition efficiency of P2 is temperature-dependent in the range from 298 to 343 K, the associated activation energy have been determined. P-2 is adsorbed on the steel surface according to a Temkin isotherm adsorption model. Significant correlations are obtained between inhibition efficiency with the calculated chemical indexes, indicating that variation of inhibition with the inhibitors structure may be explained in terms of electronic properties.

With the increase of the atomic ratio of Ni/Co (y/x, 0 < y/x < 3.5), the amount of NiOOH generated during the OER always increases; and the CoOOH initially increases and subsequently decreases, showing a similar changing tendency to the OER activity of CoNiP. When y/x = 1.5, CoNiP has the best OER activity with an overpotential of 278 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a low Tafel slope of 67 mV dec(-1). All tested CoNiP catalysts show better catalytic activity than pure CoP, indicating that the catalytic activity of CoNiP should be attributed to the synergistic effect of CoOOH and NiOOH rather than exclusively to CoOOH or NiOOH. This study clarifies the origin of the catalytic activities of CoNiP, helpful for designing high-efficiency CoNiP catalysts.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8				2046-2069		WOS:000584324000059	35515367	
J	Gao, Yibo; Zhang, Miaomaio; Mao, Yanpeng; Cao, Han; Zhang, Shujuan; Wang, Wenlong; Sun, Chenggong; Song, Zhanlong; Sun, Jing; Zhao, Xiqiang								Microwave-triggered low temperature thermal reduction of Zr-modified high entropy oxides with extraordinary thermochemical H-2 production performance								ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT				252						115125	10.1016/j.enconman.2021.115125		DEC 2021		JAN 15 2022	2022	Solar-driven two-step thermochemical H2O splitting has emerged as a promising strategy for hydrogen production, but the conversion efficiency of solar-to-fuel has to be improved to make it more economically viable. Here, we present insights on microwave-triggered low temperature (600 degrees C) oxygen exchange for water splitting based on using Zr-modified high entropy oxides. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, BET and EIS. The characterization results showed that the introduction of Zr4+ enlarged the Metal-Oxygen bond length of the spinel phase of FeMgCoNiOx and produced more oxygen vacancies with the increase of Zr4+ concentration, which greatly improved the thermochemical performance of FeMgCoNiOx. Water was splitted via reaction with FeMgCoNiOx/Zr-y that was previously reduced by microwave irradiation. By tuning the level of Zr4+ content from 0.0 to 1.0, FeMgCoNiOx/Zr-0.6 was found to show the best trade-off, giving rise to a H-2 yield of 4.84 mmol/g that was two times higher than that of FeMgCoNiOx (2.35 mmol/g) and outstanding thermodynamic energy efficiency (50 %). This work demonstrates that designing materials with abundant oxygen vacancies is a very efficient strategy to improve their thermochemical H-2 evolution activity. Moreover, the energy efficiency will be further improved through tighter control of microwave reduction energetics.									3	0	0	0	1	0	3			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000737109800004

Two sets of experiments were carried out: A) Samples were oxidized in air at 600 degrees C without heat treatment and Raman spectra were measured as a function of conversion. B) Samples were heat-treated in the range 960-1400 degrees C, in nitrogen, then characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy, in the range 800-1800 cm(-1), and then oxidized by air at 500 degrees C and by CO2 at 900 degrees C in a thermogravimetric balance. In all Raman scattering measurements the G and D bands were dominant and a weak "1180 cm(-1)" band was apparent. The following conclusions can be drawn from results of experiments A and B respectively: A) Throughout reaction with oxygen the most significant changes in reactivity and Raman features occur in the conversion range 0- 30%. This is consistent with previous measurements of thermal resistivity and intrinsic reaction rate. B) Heat treatment up to 900 degrees C at time duration up to 300 minutes did not show any effect on reactivity. Decrease in reactivity was apparent at and beyond 1200 degrees C. The characteristics of each of the three Raman bands showed clear correlation with reactivity changes both in air and CO2. These were attributed to morphological (dimensions and ordering) changes in the rearrangement of the carbon network structure, as previously suggested. Interpretation of these changes and their effect on reactivity is proposed.					1st Mediterranean Combustion Symposium (MCS-99)1st Mediterranean Combustion Symposium (MCS-99)	JUN 20-25, 1999JUN 20-25, 1999	Combust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass TransferCombust Inst; Int Ctr Heat & Mass Transfer	ANTALYA, TURKEYANTALYA, TURKEY	44	7	0	0	2	0	49			0010-2202	1563-521X		WOS:000088135800006

This was done using an electrochemical cell (EC) attached directly to the ultra high vacuum (UHV) chamber of the spectrometer, allowing the direct transfer of the electrode from the EC to the UHV chamber without exposure to ambient conditions. All the treatments have been performed in this cell, using IN H2SO4. After a polarization of the electrode to -0.5 V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE), the XPS spectrum showed no shift in the binding energy of the Ru core level peaks, indicating that no reduction of Ru(IV) occurs. Further analysis of the O Is core level spectrum also revealed that the adsorption of sulfate anions is maximum at -0.5 V versus SCE. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, traditional carbon material with high graphitization degree exhibits a relatively low electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity as it is electrochemically inert. In this work, according to the Lewis theory of acids and bases and the density functional theory (DFT) results, which show that the enriched heteroatom of B/N in the boron carbonitride (BCN) system may introduce stronger adsorption strength of OH*/H2O, respectively, we have designed and synthesized self-supporting BCN materials with different enrichment degrees of B/N (B-BCN/N-BCN) using carbon paper as substrate. Furthermore, by adjusting the contents of B and N, the optimum electrocatalytic performance of overall water splitting was obtained in which the onset voltage of water splitting on B-BCN//N-BCN was lower than 1.60 V. Our strategy of synthesizing materials with different heteroatom enrichment to improve the electronic environment of materials has opened up new opportunities for developing efficient metal-free electrocatalysts.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000617768200010	33533782

The oxide crystallizes in the hexagonal symmetry with grains size in the range [200-300 nm]. The BET analysis gives a specific surface area of similar to 4 m(2) g(-1). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance analysis gives a direct transition at 2.57 eV well matched to the solar spectrum. The transport properties exhibit n-type semiconductor with an activation energy of 0.11 eV and an electron mobility of 5.82 x 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). The physical and chemical characterizations are correlated for the construction of the energy diagram in order to assess the photoelectrochemical properties for the oxygen evolution. The valence band, deriving from O2-:2p orbital (2.19 V-SCE), is located above the O-2/H2O potential (similar to 1.5 V-SCE), allowing O-2-evolution upon visible light (15 mW cm(-2)) and the oxide is photocathodically protected against corrosion. An evolution rate of 0.046 mL mg(-1) h(-1) is obtained within 20 min upon visible light and under optimal conditions (200 mg of catalyst, pH similar to 3 and 50 degrees C).									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			1369-8001	1873-4081		WOS:000424934600032

Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non-equilibrium high-temperature (>1400 K) thermal-shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr-Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (approximate to 77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high-energy surface structures with dislocation-induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high-temperature thermal-shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.									23	0	0	0	1	0	22			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000715581000001	34676920

Here, the methanol steam reforming reaction on both powder (Ni-CeO2) and model (Ni-CeO2-x(111)) catalysts was investigated. The active phase evolution and surface species transformation on powder catalysts were studied via in sins X-ray diffraction (XRD) and diffuse reflectance infrared transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Phase transitions of NiO -> NiC -> Ni and CeO2 -> CeO2-x were observed during the reaction. The simultaneous production of H-2/CO2 demonstrates that the active phase of the catalysts contains metallic Ni supported over partially reduced ceria. The DRIFTS experiments indicate that a methoxy to formate transition is associated with the reduction of ceria whereas the formation of carbonate species results from the presence of metallic Ni. A study of the reaction of methanol with Ni-CeO2-x(111) by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) points to the essential role of metal-support interactions in an oxygen transfer from ceria to Ni that contributes to the high selectivity of the catalysts.									32	4	0	0	1	0	34			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000432490200009

It has a cylindrical rotor and dual cells for discharging O-2 and for the H2O splitting reaction. A detailed specification and the efficiency of the rotary-type solar reactor were examined for the two-step water-splitting process. The maximum temperature of the reactive ceramics mounted on the cylindrical rotor was ca. 1623 K by irradiation with a solar simulator of an infrared imaging lamp. Repetition of the two-step water-splitting process using the rotary-type solar reactor with CeO2 was achieved, and successive evolution of H-2 was observed in the H2O-splitting reaction cell at the optimum reaction temperatures of the O-2-releasing reaction cell (T = 1623 K) and H2O-splitting reaction cell (T = 1273 K). Also, repetition of the two-step water-splitting process was achieved in the case of using the reactive ceramics of Ni,Mn-ferrite, and its optimum reaction temperatures of the O-2-releasing and H-2-generation reactions were 1473 and 1173 K, respectively. It was confirmed that the higher O-2-releasing reaction temperature of above 1800 K was achieved with the about 10-times scaled-up rotary-type solar reactor.									105	3	0	0	0	0	109			0887-0624			WOS:000248085100058

For comparison, the conventional electro-Fenton cathode, graphite gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and graphite electrode, was also tested. Experiments showed that the side reaction of H-2 evolution was avoided and the H2O2 accumulation concentration arrived at the maximal value at CNTS cathode as the cathode potential was set at -0.5 V (vs. SCE). The apparent rate constant for DMP degradation was 0.057 min(-1) at CNTS cathode, much higher than 0.005 min(-1) at graphite cathode and 0.011min(-1) at graphite GDE. Meanwhile, CNTS possessed desirable stability without performance decay after 20 times reaction. It was also found that more negative cathode potential than -0.5 V could cause the side reaction of H2 evolution and thus leading to a deteriorated DMP degradation. Moreover, the initial DMP concentration affected the apparent rate constant of DMP degradation. Compared to the case of higher initial DMP concentration, DMP degraded faster in the case of lower initial DMP concentration. The pH value and initial Fe2+ concentration for DMP degradation at CNTS cathode were optimized to be 3.0 and 0.5 mmol L-1, respectively. The CNTS is promising to be potentially used as the cathode for electro-Fenton system to remove organic pollutants in wastewater. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, a new ultrathin porous Cu1-xNixS/NF nano-sheets array was constructed on the 3D nickel skeleton by two-step method: hydrothermal method and vulcanization method. Through these two processes, Cu1-xNixS/NF has a larger specific surface area than that of foamed nickel (NF) and Cu1-xNixO/NF. The Cu1-xNixS/NF materials show excellent catalytic activity by accelerating the electron transfer rate and increase the amount of H-2 and O-2 produced. The lower overpotential was obtained only 350 mV at 20 mA cm(-2) for OER, not only that, but also the same phenomenon is pointed out in HER, optimal Cu1-xNixS/NF presents low overpotentials of 189 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH for HER. Both OER and HER shows a lower Tafel slope: 51.2 mV dec(-1) and 127.2 mV dec(-1), subsequently, the overall water splitting activity of Cu1-xNixS/NF was investigated, and the low cell voltage was 1.64 V (current density 10 mA cm(-2)). It can be stable for 14 h during the overall water splitting reaction. These results fully demonstrate that Cu1-xNixS/NF non-precious metal materials can be invoked become one of the effective catalysts for overall water splitting, providing a richer resource for energy storage.

Herein, a facile one-step hydrothermal approach is proposed to fabricate 3D hierarchical microcages composed of MoSe2-NiSe@carbon nanosheets for the efficient electro-catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by water hydrolysis. The heterostrucutres were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The nanohybrids of MoSe2-NiSe are constructed by in situ combination of hexagonal NiSe and MoSe2, where the high quality vertical heterostructure can benefit the electrons transfer from metallic NiSe to the MoSe2 matrix, accomplishing the electronic modulation of MoSe2-NiSe@carbon catalysts for robust electrocatalytic performance.

For a typical sample obtained by pyrolyzing poly(2,6-diaminopyridine) (PDAP) under ammonia atmosphere followed by successive cyclic voltammetry scans in 0.5 M H2SO4, a current density of 60 mA cm(-2) was obtained at an overpotential of only 50 mV. Although the Pt loading is only 1.5 wt % in the sample, this performance is even, better than that of the commercial 20 wt % Pt/C. The experimental results indicate that the deposited Pt nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the electrode substrate with a size of 2-4 nm. Further experimental' results suggest that the combination of three factors, including the slow release of Pt into solution, high specific surface area of the substrate materials, and homogeneously doped N atoms acting as Pt anchor sites, is the key for formation of the highly active Pt nanoparticles. This study thus also raises an alarm regarding the use of Pt counter; electrode in HER catalysis, especially by N-doped carbon in an acidic solution..									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1932-7447			WOS:000400534100029

The FeOOH nanorod with a tetragonal structure (beta-FeOOH) is gradually converted into a rhombohedral Fe2O3 nanorod by a simple thermal treatment. The existence of an intermediate FeOOH structure with high lattice strains during the phase transition is identified by Rietveld analysis using XRD. The electrochemical properties of the nanorods are investigated based on the crystal phases to elucidate their relative catalytic activities.

To address such issues, for the first time, we design and synthesize FeNi3-Fe3O4 heterogeneous nanoparticles (NPs) homogenously anchored on a matrix of metal-organic framework (MOF) nanosheets and carbon nanotubes (FeNi3-Fe(3)o(4) NPs/MOT-CNT) by a facile hydrothermal reaction and subsequent partial decomposition of a low-cost and earth-abundant Ni/Fe/C precursor. Due to its unique porous nanoarchitecture constructed by ultrafine nanoparticles anchored on two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets/one-dimensional (1D) CNT matrix, it can be employed as a bifunctional electrocatalyst with superior electrocatalytic activity for water splitting: it delivers a small Tafel slope of 37 mV/dec for OER and requires only a very low overpotential of 234 mV to obtain 10 mA/cm(2); it has a very low overpotential of 108 mV for HER and also shows an ultralow overpotential of 360 mV to reach 10 mA/cm(2) for overall water splitting by outperforming the precious-metal-based electrocatalysts (Pt/C and RuO2; 393 mV at eta(10)). Moreover, it exhibits excellent longterm stability. This work presents a rational nanoarchitecture design and facile fabrication strategy to obtain nonprecious metalbased electrocatalysts with high efficiency and excellent long-lasting abilities.									47	9	0	0	0	0	47			2168-0485			WOS:000519150200033

Alkaline water electrolysis has been considered as one of the most prospective technologies for large scale hydrogen production. To boost the sluggish kinetics of hy-drogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, abundant materials have been designed and fabricated. Herein, we summarize the key achievements in the development of layered transi-tion-metal hydroxides [TM(OH)(x)] for efficient alkaline HER. Based on the structure of TM(OH)(x) the mechanism of synergistic effect between TM(OH)(x) and HER active materials is illuminated firstly. Then, recent progress of TM(OH)(x)-based HER catalysts to optimize the synergistic effect are catego-rized as TM(OH)(x) and active materials, including species, structure, morphology and interaction relationship. Furthermore, TM(OH)(x)-based overall water splitting electrocatalysts and electrodes are summarized in the design principles for high activity and stability. Finally, some of key chal-lenges for further developments and applications of hydrogen production are proposed. (C) 2020, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Charge fitting results at HF/STO-3G level (the reason why the basis set is adopted is shown in the cited literatures) show good linear correlation, proving the rationality and efficiency of the ABEEMsp model in calculating charge distributions. It can be seen from MD simulations that bidirectional isomerizations of the Mn4CaO5 cluster accompany by the transfer of Ca-bound water molecule W3 to pentacoordinate Mn1(III)/Mn4(III). For the g = 2 to g = 4.1 form, W3 leaves for Mn4(III), while W3 moves to Mn1(III) for the inverse course. Both processes involve motions to the original positions of W4 to W3, W588 to W4, and local rearrangements of the water environment, which may indicate the importance of hydrogen bond network to biocatalysis. The observation of W3 coordination to the vacant site of Mn(III) as the sixth ligand proximal to O-5 may imply W3 could be the fast-exchanging substrate water (W-f) in the S-2 state, which makes O-2 with O-5 in the S-4 state. Based on the inference, we investigate O-O bond formation in all the possible spin states for the two isomeric structures under the framework of oxo-oxyl radical coupling mechanism. It is demonstrated from BS-DFT calculations that O-2 formation activity is significantly advantageous for the open-cubane structure than the closed-cubane form, i.e. the differences of barriers and driving forces are beyond 20 kcal/mol and 25 kcal/mol, respectively. For the open-cubane structure, the antiferromagnetic coupling of Mn1(IV)-O-center dot stabilizes the reactants, and the spin-parallel feature between O-center dot radical and Mn4(IV) lowers the barriers, and ferromagnetic coupling of Mn1-Mn3 ensures the release of triplet O-2. For the closed-cubane structure, the antiferromagnetic coupled Mn4(IV)-O-center dot changes to more stabilized Mn4(III)-oxo, losing the radical character of the ligand oxygen, which greatly increases the barriers. The ferromagnetic coupled Mn4(IV)-O-center dot does not belong to the relatively stable electronic configuration of reactants, and cannot be formed by spin frustration from the stable spin states, for their large energy differences above 20 kcal/mol. Thus it cannot be accepted as the accesses of effective reaction channels. Our work expounds the exclusive role of the open-cubane OEC in oxo-oxyl coupling mechanism of O-2 creation. It also reveals that the oxygen evolution reactivity is extremely dependent on the spin coupling ways of manganeses and oxygen radical, meanwhile, the structural flexibility of the OEC is essential to the S-state cycle and photosynthetic water splitting.									7	4	0	0	1	0	7			0567-7351			WOS:000412869600008		
J	Wen, Fuyu; Li, Can					Wen, Fuyu/0000-0002-0156-1737			Hybrid Artificial Photosynthetic Systems Comprising Semiconductors as Light Harvesters and Biomimetic Complexes as Molecular Cocatalysts								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				46	11			2355	2364		10.1021/ar300224u				NOV 19 2013	2013	Solar fuel production through artificial photosynthesis may be a key to generating abundant and clean energy, thus addressing the high energy needs of the world's expanding population. As the crucial components of photosynthesis, the artificial photosynthetic system should be composed of a light harvester (e.g., semiconductor or molecular dye), a reduction cocatalyst (e.g., hydrogenase mimic, noble metal), and an oxidation cocatalyst (e.g., photosystem II mimic for oxygen evolution from water oxidation). Solar fuel production catalyzed by an artificial photosynthetic system starts from the absorption of sunlight by the light harvester, where charge separation takes place, followed by a charge transfer to the reduction and oxidation cocatalysts, where redox reaction processes occur. One of the most challenging problems is to develop an artificial photosynthetic solar fuel production system that is both highly efficient and stable. The assembly of cocatalysts on the semiconductor (light harvester) not only can facilitate the charge separation, but also can lower the activation energy or overpotential for the reactions. An efficient light harvester loaded with suitable reduction and oxidation cocatalysts is the key for high efficiency of artificial photosynthetic systems.In this Account, we describe our strategy of hybrid photocatalysts using semiconductors as light harvesters with biomimetic complexes as molecular cocatalysts to construct efficient and stable artificial photosynthetic systems. We chose semiconductor nanoparticles as light harvesters because of their broad spectral absorption and relatively robust properties compared with a natural photosynthesis system. Using biomimetic complexes as cocatalysts can significantly facilitate charge separation via fast charge transfer from the semiconductor to the molecular cocatalysts and also catalyze the chemical reactions of solar fuel production. The hybrid photocitalysts supply us with a platform to study the photocatalytic mechanisms of H-2/O-2 evolution and CO2 reduction at the molecular level and to bridge natural and artificial photosynthesis. We demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid photocatalyst, biomimetic molecular cocatalysts, and semiconductor light harvester for artificial photosynthesis and therefore provide a promising approach for rational design and construction of highly efficient and stable artificial photosynthetic systems.									235	6	0	0	30	0	236			0001-4842	1520-4898		WOS:000327360800002	23730891

The oxygen release is generally attributed to the phase transitions from the layered structure to spinel and rocksalt structures that contain less lattice oxygen. Here, a different degradation pathway in LiCoO2 is found, through oxygen vacancy facilitated cation migration and reduction. This process leaves undercoordinated oxygen that gives rise to oxygen release while the structure integrity of the defect-free region is mostly preserved. This oxygen release mechanism can be called surface degradation due to the kinetic control of the cation migration but has a slow surface to bulk propagation with continuous loss of the surface cation ions. It is also strongly correlated with the high-voltage cycling defects that end up with a significant local oxygen release at low temperatures. This work unveils the thermal vulnerability of high-voltage Li-ion batteries and the critical role of the surface fraction as a general mitigating approach.									56	0	0	0	2	0	56			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000537682300101	32302090

Using reactive molecular dynamics simulations with model-based or high-quality potential energy surfaces provides a means to specifically and quantitatively probe individual reaction channels at a molecular level. The formation of CO2 from collision of CO((1)Sigma) and O(D-1) is characterized on amorphous solid water (ASW) under conditions typical in cold molecular clouds. Recombination takes place on the subnanosecond time scale and internal energy redistribution leads to stabilization of the product with CO2 remaining adsorbed on the ASW on extended time scales. Using a high-level, reproducing kernel-based potential energy surface for CO2, formation into and stabilization of CO2 and COO are observed.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1948-7185			WOS:000680449800005	34270244

Maark, Tuhina Adit/AAZ-1630-2020				Understanding Strain and Ligand Effects in Hydrogen Evolution over Pd(111) Surfaces								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				118	8			4275	4281		10.1021/jp4121035				FEB 27 2014	2014	Pseudomorphic catalytic systems can exhibit enhanced or inhibited activity relative to the pure surface parent metal, based on a combination of strain and ligand effects. In contrast, mechanically strained and dealloyed systems can exhibit pure strain effects. Density functional calculations for hydrogen adsorption at different coverages between 0.25 and 1 monolayer on biaxially strained Pd(111) are carried out to illustrate its comparison to selected pseudomorphic Pd overlayers (Pd/M). The differing catalytic behavior for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in separation of the ligand and strain effects present in Pd/M pseudomorphs and the consequent modification of the binding strengths caused by them individually are estimated. The strain exhibits a systematic contribution to binding energy changes while the ligand effect can act to either intensify or weaken the strain effect. In certain systems (e.g., Pd/Ir) the ligand effect is more pronounced than the strain. effect while in others (e.g., Pd/Au) the strain effect is larger. The individual contributions of strain and ligand effects to shifts in the d-band center are also calculated and found to correlate well with the observed binding energy changes. We suggest that in the absence of a ligand effect-as would be expected in mechanically strained Pd (111)-H binding is tunable, and a differential free energy of hydrogen adsorption of similar to 0 eV (at 0 V vs RHE) is achieved at various combinations of strain and coverage. For pure Pd under compressive strain, this leads to a prediction of a broad region of enhanced activity for the HER which may compare favorably to Pd overlayers supported on more expensive metals such as Pt and PtRu.									75	4	0	0	4	0	76			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000332188100047

An agar plate assay was used to screen the mutant libraries for activity. Screening for improved enantioselectivity was subsequently done by spectrophotometric progress curve analysis of the conversion of para-nitrophenyl glycidyl ether (pNPGE). Kinetic resolutions showed that eight mutants were obtained with up to 13-fold improved enantioselectivity toward pNPGE and at least three other epoxides. The large enhancements in enantioselectivity toward epichlorohydrin and 1,2-epoxyhexane indicated that pNPGE acts as an epoxyalkane mimic. Active site mutations were found in all shuffled mutants, which can be explained by an interaction of the affected amino acid with the epoxide oxygen or the hydrophobic moiety of the substrate. Several mutations in the shuffled mutants had additive effects.									96	1	0	0	71	0	100			1074-5521	1879-1301		WOS:000222987300015	15271356

Here, a novel oxide material LiCuTa3O9 (LCTO) with a characteristic perovskite-like structure, exhibiting a visible light absorption edge of approximate to 500 nm due to the hybridization of Cu 3d and O 2p orbitals, is reported. The structure of the as-obtained LCTO is experimentally characterized and theoretically simulated. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Mott-Schottky, and density functional theory calculation results show that the LCTO is an n-type semiconductor with bandgap of approximate to 2.48 eV and exhibits suitable conduction band and valence band positions of approximate to-0.45 and 2.03 eV vs reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. Based on initial optimization of preparative conditions and loading of cocatalysts, the as-modified LCTO sample can drive both water reduction and oxidation half reactions in the presence of corresponding sacrificial reagents under visible light irradiation (lambda >= 420 nm), demonstrating its promising application in solar water splitting. The dual functional features of LCTO render it a promising photocatalyst for one-step overall water splitting to produce hydrogen. In addition, the unobvious structural change of the LCTO photocatalyst during the reaction and repeated runs of the photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction demonstrate its good photochemical stability.									27	2	0	0	0	0	27			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000453273200011

The simple cobalt corrole [Co(tpfc)(py)(2)] (1, tpfc = 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl) corrole, py = pyridine) catalyzed both water oxidation and proton reduction efficiently. By coating complex 1 onto indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, the turnover frequency for electrocatalytic water oxidation was 0.20 s(-1) at 1.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 7), and it was 1010 s(-1) for proton reduction at -1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl, pH = 0.5). The stability of 1 for catalytic oxygen evolution and hydrogen production was evaluated by electrochemical, UV-vis and mass measurements, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which confirmed that 1 was the real molecular catalyst. Titration and UV-vis experiments showed that the pyridine group on Co dissociated at the beginning of catalysis, which was critical to subsequent activation of water. A proton-coupled electron transfer process was involved based on the pH dependence of the water oxidation reaction catalyzed by 1. As for manganese corroles 2-6, although their oxidizing powers were comparable to that of 1, they were not as stable as 1 and underwent decomposition at the electrode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that water oxidation by 1 was feasible through a proposed catalytic cycle. The formation of an O-O bond was suggested to be the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation barrier of 18.1 kcal mol(-1) was in good agreement with that obtained from experiments.									164	8	0	0	6	0	166			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000329175700016	24327074

Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are promising candidates for durable HER catalysts due to their cost-effective, highly active edges and Earth-abundant elements to replace Pt electrocatalysts. Herein, we design an active, stable earth-abundant TMDCs based catalyst, WS(1-x)Sex nanoparticles-decorated onto a 3D porous graphene/Ni foam. The WS(1-x)Sex/graphene/NF catalyst exhibits fast hydrogen evolution kinetics with a moderate overpotential of similar to-93 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of similar to 51 mV dec(-1), and a long cycling lifespan more than 20 h in 0.5 M sulfuric acid, which is much better than WS2/NF and WS2/graphene/NF catalysts.

A Pd-Sn alloy electrocatalyst was developed for the exclusive conversion of CO2 into formic acid in an aqueous solution. This catalyst showed a nearly perfect faradaic efficiency toward formic acid formation at the very low overpotential of -0.26V, where both CO formation and hydrogen evolution were completely suppressed.

ORR electrocatalysts currently employed in the cathodes of fuel cells and metal-air batteries are mainly based on high-cost and scarce noble metal elements. It is thus of great importance to develop cheap and earth-abundant ORR electrocatalysts. In this aspect, redox-active transition metal hydroxides, a class of multifunctional inorganic layered materials, have been proposed as prospective candidates on account of their abundance and high ORR activities. In this article, the preparation and structural evolution of transition metal hydroxides, in particular their exfoliation into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets, as well as compositing/integrating with catalytic active and/or conductive components to overcome the insulating nature of hydroxides in alkaline ORR, are summarized. Recent advances have demonstrated that 2D transition metal hydroxides with carefully tuned compositions and elaborately designed nanoarchitectures can achieve both high activity and high pathway selectivity, as well as excellent stability comparable to those of commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts. To realize the dream of renewable electrochemical energy conversion, new strategies and insights into rational designing of 2D hydroxide-based nanostructures with further enhanced electrocatalytic performance are still to be vigorously pursued.									21	3	0	0	1	0	21			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000585977000001	33089855

However, the limited active sites, poor structural stability and intense hydrogen (H) adsorption energy of these catalysts endow them with unsatisfactory performance, which significantly impedes their practical application in acidic/alkaline/neutral media. Herein, we designed a series of defective nickel-cobalt sulfur-based catalysts with an enriched heterogeneous interface. The P anions not only offer ample sulfur defects for charge movement, but also provide a protection layer to prevent structural collapse in acidic/alkaline media. More importantly, the P element with low electronegativity slightly lowers the robust strength of S-H bonds, yet maintains the activity of the S-based catalysts, thereby balancing the adsorption/release of H. Subsequently, the introduction of the heterointerface accompanied by P creates controllable interfacial electron transfer between Ni-based components (Ni3SxPy) and Co components (Co3SxPy), which can regulate the charge state and enhance charge transfer kinetics for boosted HER. Meanwhile, the planar structure establishes a highly conductive network for facilitated ion/electron transportation, leading to an accelerated redox reaction. Attributed to its structural benefits, an admirable HER performance with an optimum overpotential of 56 mV and a Tafel slope of 74 mV dec(-1) with -10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and decent long-term stability can be achieved. This work paves the way for S-based catalyst design to achieve superior HER performance in the universal pH range.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000865269000001

The role of the vapour phases from ferrosilicon nitride (FexSiy-Si3N4) and Al2O3 was studied by phase evolution, microstructure, and thermodynamic analyses. The results show that the formation of 15R-SiAlON is highly related to SiO(g), Si(g), Al2O(g) and Al(g) from FexSiy-Si3N4-Al2O3 composites. At 1800 degC in flowing nitrogen, SiO(g) and Si(g) are generated from ferrosilicon nitride. Al2O(g) and Al(g) are released from Al2O3, and their pressures depend on that of oxygen. The increase of ferrosilicon nitride promotes the generation of vapour phases. The diffusion of Al2O(g) and Al(g) into Si3N4, and of SiO(g) and Si(g) into Al2O3 particles enable the growth of 15R-SiAlON flakes based on both the Si3N4 and Al2O3 substrates by solid-gas reaction. In the presence of the Fe-Si liquid, 15R-SiAlON whiskers with Fe-Si sphere on the top are generated by the liquid-solid-gas mechanism. The reactions between Al2O(g)/Al(g) and SiO(g)/Si(g) in nitrogen generate large amounts of 15R-SiAlON whiskers by the gas-gas mechanism.

Herein, Ce and Ga codoped Zn(O,S) has been synthesized with different amounts of Ce using facile precipitation method at a low temperature of 95 degrees C and characterized by XRD, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, EPR, Raman, DRS, PL, EIS, UV-vis, GC-MS, and photocurrent response measurements. The as-prepared photocatalysts were utilized for hydrogen production and hydrogenation of toxic organic compounds, viz. nitrobenzene (NB) and azobenzene (AB) into a valuable product of aniline. The incorporation of Ce and Ga into Zn(O,S) enhanced the hydrogen evolution and hydrogenation reactions of NB and AB. This notable enhancement was ascribed to the synergistic effects of Ce and Ga dopants to form positively charged defects that trap the photogenerated electron. The trapping mechanism improves the photogenerated charge separation and transfer as confirmed with impedance spectroscopy (EIS), transient photocurrent response, and PL measurements. The highest hydrogen production was attained by 15Ce-5Ga-Zn(O, S) with a rate of 7130 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) in 10% ethanol solution. In addition, NB and AB were effectively converted to aniline in 15 min and 30 min, respectively. A plausible photocatalytic hydrogenation mechanism for both hydrogenation of NB and AB is proposed with the steps of surface adsorption, molecular diffusion, pinning at oxygen vacancy sites, and hydrogenation reaction with the help of in situ generated H+ coupled with electrons.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000691469200003

However, in the earlier attempts, the atomic structure of such co-doped graphene could not be altered; thus, there is a lack of reports discussing the influence of the atomic arrangement in the catalytic performance of the co-doped graphene. Here, by co-doping P and N atoms in graphene as a model system, we present a facile and two-step process wherein the sequence of doping helps in manipulating the heteroatom substitution, which is of great importance in defining better crystallinity and conductivity and favorable elemental functionalities and hence improving catalytic performance. The present method provides a clean, flexible, binder-free, and readily available electrocatalyst that avoids tedious conventional synthesis and device fabrication steps. The highest P-doping percentage (6 at. %) in the present work is superior to previous reports (3 at. %). By altering the sequence of N- and P-doping, the co-doped graphene electrode displayed excellent performance, with an increment of 148% in the sp(2) domain size and enormous lowering in overpotential and Tafel slope (78%). Further, the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst sustains >98% for 20 h, which is significantly higher than the well-known MoSx (63%). Although here the P-N co-doped system was utilized as a proof of concept, this method could be adapted for other versatile co-doped graphene. This work may pave the way for the development of co-doped graphene-based devices where manipulation of atomic arrangement can result in a structure with properties desirable for catalytic or electronics applications.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000486360900039

A suitable conductive scaffold can play a positive role in enhancing the relevant hydrogen evolution performance. Here we demonstrate that three-dimensional NiCoSe2 nanosheet arrays supported on Ni foam are effective as the conductive scaffold for enhancing the catalytic activity of layered MoS1.5Se0.5 particles. The resulting hierarchical MoS1.5Se0.5/NiCoSe2, hybrid electrocatalyst is highly efficient for hydrogen evolution in acid, yielding geometric current densities of 10, 50, and 100 mA cm(-2) at overpotentials as low as 57, 88, and 102 mV with good long-term durability at current densities up to 500 mA cm(-2) over 25 h. To the best of our knowledge, no MoS2-based electrocatalyst can realize both low overpotential affording a current density of 500 mA cm(-2) and good durability at a large current density (500 mA cm(-2)) except this report. In particular, the double-layer capacitance, turnover frequency measurements, and high normalized exchange current density indicate its possibly high intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution in acid. It is among the most efficient earth-abundant catalysts exhibiting a low overpotential and simultaneous good intrinsic activity reported on a three-dimensional architecture thus far.									54	3	0	0	2	0	54			2155-5435			WOS:000508466700056

But its sluggish four-electron reaction leads to a high overpotential. Current commercial OER catalysts are mainly noble metal-based materials, but their high cost restricts their broad application. Therefore, extensive efforts have been devoted to exploring low-cost and efficient OER catalysts. Nonprecious metal-based materials have been regarded as promising OER catalyst candidates, due to their abundancy on the earth, controllable morphologies and tunable chemical states. Among various nonprecious metal-based materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted much attention, because of their large specific surface area and rich metal centers. However, their poor electrochemical activities. stabilities and conductivities severely affect their application in OER catalysis. To improve the activities of MOFs, several methods have been adopted, such as synthesizing ultrathin nanosheets, growing MOFs on nickel foam or carbon cloth, doping heteroatoms, and introducing synergistic interactions between two materials. In 1970, Wagner proposed a space-charge them). which indicates that the carrier property can be tuned through adjusting interface. Inspired by this theory, constructing metal oxide-catalyst interface seems to be a promising strategy to improve activities of catalysts. CeO2 is a well-known cocatalyst due to its reversible Ce3+/Ce4+ redox. Previous works have demonstrated that OER performance can be effectively improved through introducing CeO2 since it can speed up the electron mobility and induce strong interaction between CeO2 and metal sites. In this work, an efficient OER catalyst was achieved through introducing CeO2 into FeNi MOF catalyst. FeNi MOF nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam was firstly prepared via a solvothennal process. Then CeO2 nanoclusters (5 nm) were coated onto FeNi MOF surface by electrodeposition. A series of characterizations were employed to study the morphology, structure and surface electronic state information of the as-obtained CeO2/FeNi MOF. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis, the doping of CeO2 clusters and the strong electronic interaction between CeO2 clusters and FeNi MOF induce the formation of Fe/Ni-O-Ce bonds and optimize the electronic structures of Fe/Ni sites, which will enhance OER activities. The OER performance tests confirm that CeO2/FeNi MOF indeed exhibits a superior OER activity than FeNi MOF alone. The hybrid catalyst delivers a higher mass activity (235.4 A.g(-1)) and a faster turnover frequency (0.065 s(-1)) than those of FeNi MOF (43.8 A.g(-1), 0.018 s(-1)). Compared with FeNi MOF, CeO2/FeNi MOF also shows better OER kinetics, as evidenced by a decreased Tafel slope, a reduced charge transfer resistance. Besides, CeO2/FeNi MOF presents an outstanding stability (50 h, 50 mA.cm(2)). All these features make our CeO2/FeNi MOF a potential catalyst in the future application. The interfacial strategy through introducing CeO2 to modulate Fe and Ni active sites may open a door for developing high-performance OER catalysts in future.									7	4	0	0	1	0	7			0567-7351			WOS:000537764900008

However, the number of cytochrome b-559 associated with the photosystem II reaction center has been the subject of controversy. Some studies have concluded that there is one heme equivalent of cytochrome b-559 per reaction center, some studies have found two, and some studies have reported intermediate values. Most of the previous experiments have used only one method to quantitate the antenna size of the preparation. In this study, we compare the cytochrome b-559 content in a cyanobacterial and a plant photosystem II preparation. The plant preparation is derived from spinach, and previous work has shown that it has an antenna size of approximately 100 chlorophylls [MacDonald, G. M., & Barry, B. A. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 9848-9856]. The cyanobacterial preparation is from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and previous work has shown that it has an antenna size of approximately 60 chlorophylls [Noren, G.H., Boerner, R. J., & Barry, B.A. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 3943-3950]. Both preparations are isolated through the use of ion-exchange chromatography, and both preparations are monodisperse in the same nonionic detergent. In our comparative study, we quantitate antenna size by three different methods. Our work shows that, depending on the method used to estimate antenna size, the oxygen-evolving spinach photosystem II preparation contains 0.82-1.0 cytochrome b-559 per reaction center, while the oxygen-evolving cyanobacterial preparation contains 1.5-2.1 cytochrome b-559 per reaction center.									34	1	0	0	24	0	35			0006-2960			WOS:A1994NF70100037	8155657

Shell convection sustained by helium burning, transient neon burning, dredge-out, urca cooling, and other properties of an 11 M-circle dot population I model star								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				515	1			381	397		10.1086/307017				APR 10 1999	1999	A stellar model of mass 11 M. and Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence through the core carbon-burning phase. In contrast with 9, 10, and 10.5 M. models studied in earlier papers of this series, carbon burning is ignited at the center of the 11 M, model. Like the 10.5 M, model, the 11 M. model experiences a dredge-out episode at the end of the carbon-burning phase. At the beginning of this episode, a semiconvective zone forms at the base of the hydrogen-rich envelope and carries hydrogen inward in mass toward the outer edge of a fully convective zone that is sustained by helium burning at its base. Hydrogen diffuses into the helium-rich convective zone until a hydrogen shell flash occurs. Helium burning dies out and the outer edge of the convective layer, sustained by fluxes due to hydrogen burning, extends outward in mass through hydrogen-rich material, mixing freshly synthesized nuclei outward. Then, hydrogen burning dies out and the outer edge of the convective shell, now sustained primarily by fluxes due to the release of gravothermal energy, moves outward until it reaches the inner edge of the convective envelope. Freshly synthesized material is then convected to the surface. Mixing during the final phase of homogenization in the convective envelope is maintained by fluxes due to the release of gravothermal energy. At the end of the dredge-out phase, the surface nitrogen abundance has decreased and the C/N ratio has changed from less than unity to larger than unity, showing that mixing has extended into regions where helium burning has manufactured substantial quantities of C-12 and destroyed N-14. Prior to the dredge-out phase, neon burning is narrowly averted, and, after the dredge-out phase, neutrino losses due to electron capture and decay reactions between A = 25 and A = 23 isotopes in and above convective Urea shells cool the inner portions of the electron-degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) core. Ultimately, the model becomes a thermally pulsing super-asymptotic giant branch (TPSAGB) star with an ONe core of mass similar to 1.368 M.. Hydrogen and helium burning over a period of similar to 1.4 x 10(4) yr of TPSAGB evolution add a carbon-oxygen layer of mass similar to 0.014 M. to the electron-degenerate core. Then, electron captures on products of carbon burning lead to the collapse of the core into a neutron star and expulsion of the envelope in a weak Type II supernova explosion. The ratio of helium to hydrogen in the ejecta is approximately twice solar.									111	0	1	0	0	0	112			0004-637X			WOS:000080226400031

Accumulation of crtA, crtC, crtD, crtE, crtF, crtK, bchC and bchD mRNAs increased transiently and coordinately, up to 12-fold following removal of oxygen from the growth medium, paralleling increases in mRNAs encoding pigment-binding polypeptides of the photosynthetic apparatus. The crtB and crtI genes, in contrast, were expressed similarly in the presence or absence of oxygen. The regulation patterns of promoters for the crtA and crtI genes and the bchCXYZ operon were characterized using lacZ transcriptional fusion and qualitatively reflected the corresponding mRNA accumulation patterns. We also report that the bchI gene product, encoded by a DNA sequence previously considered to be a portion of crtA, shares 49% sequence identity with the nuclear-encoded Arabidopsis thaliana Cs chloroplast protein required for normal pigmentation in plants.									22	1	0	0	20	0	23			0022-1287			WOS:A1993LD45200001	8336108

The semiconducting nature of Mg3N2 monolayer motivates us to investigate the HER mechanism on this sheet. We have constructed the reaction coordinate associated with HER mechanism after determining the hydrogen adsorption energy on Mg3N2 monolayer, while investigating all possible adsorption sites. After obtaining the adsorption energy, we subsequently obtain the adsorption free energy while adding zero point energy difference (Delta ZPE) and entropic contribution (T Delta S). We have not only confined our investigations to a single hydrogen, but have thoroughly observed the adsorption phenomena for increasing number of hydrogen atoms on the surface. We have determined the projected density of states (DOS) in order to find the elemental contribution in the valence band and conduction band regime for all the considered cases. We have also compared the work function value among all the cases, which quantifies the amount of energy required for taking an electron out of the surface. The charge transfer mechanism is also being investigated in order to correlate with the HER mechanism with amount of charge transfer. This is the first attempt on this material to the best of our knowledge, where theoretical investigation has been done to mapping the reaction coordinate of HER mechanism with the associated charge transfer process and the work function values, not only for single hydrogen adsorption, but also for increasing number of adsorbed hydrogen.

However, these materials suffer from poor cycling performance, which is exacerbated by increased cell voltage. We demonstrate here the detrimental effect of ethylene carbonate (EC), a core component in conventional electrolytes, when NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2) is charged above 4.4 V vs Li/Li+-the onset potential for lattice oxygen release. Oxygen loss is enhanced by EC-containing electrolytes -compared to EC-free -and correlates with more electrolyte oxidation/ breakdown and cathode surface degradation, which increase concurrently above 4.4 V. In contrast, NMC111 (LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2), which does not release oxygen up to 4.6 V, shows a similar extent of degradation irrespective of the electrolyte. This work highlights the incompatibility between conventional EC-based electrolytes and Ni-rich cathodes (more generally, cathodes that release lattice oxygen such as Li-/Mn-rich and disordered rocksalt cathodes) and motivates further work on wider classes of electrolytes and additives.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2380-8195			WOS:000859283000001	36277132

The Pt-skin trimetallic core-shell systems of Pt-shell-(Re-Ni)(core) and Pt-shell-(Fe-Cn-Fe-Ni)(core) (n = 12, 24, 36, 42 and 50) are evaluated based on reactivity and stability criteria via density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The oxygen adsorption energy, d-band center, and evolution of the system under PEMFC operating temperature are used as indicators of reactivity, whereas the stability in acid medium is evaluated by the segregation of subsurface catalyst atoms and by the trends of the Pt-skin surface to be dissolved in acid medium. For the Pt-shell-(Re-Ni)(core) system, the reactivity is found to be better than that of pure Pt as shown by the weaker oxygen adsorption strength on the alloy surface and the downshift of the d-band center as well as by the reconstruction of the Pt-skin (100) facets to a more reactive (111) facet observed only on the alloy nanoparticle under both vacuum and oxidative environments. For the alloy stability, the results suggest that the larger nanoparticle (1.5 nm) is more stable than the smaller one (1.3 nm) against segregation of Re shell atoms to the surface, while the segregation of the Ni core to the Re shell for both systems is negligible. Similar trends regarding nanoparticle size are found based on Pt-skin surface dissolution analysis. Other core-shell Pt-144-(Fe-110-Cn-Ni-6)(core) nanoparticles investigated are composed of a carbide-containing inner layer introduced as a core-anchoring material to avoid segregation of inner metal atoms to the surface. DFT analysis is conducted to determine the optimum composition of the carbide layer that may improve the nanoparticle stability. According to the DFT results, the core-anchoring carbide composition required to enhance both reactivity and stability of the system is between Fe2.6C1.0 and Fe3.1C1.0 as these formulae provide optimal oxygen adsorption strength and prevent segregation of the non-noble atoms. However, the system of a larger size is more favorable to control Pt surface dissolution.									20	0	0	0	0	0	20			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000378734700056

X-ray diffraction data for HxY2BaCuO5 indicate that the reaction sequence for this oxide consists of the formation of a solid solution phase up to x almost-equal-to 2.1, in which the partial molar volume of H, V(H)BAR, is nearly zero, followed by the precipitation of a hydrogen-rich phase. The maximum H-2 uptake achieved to date corresponds to H3.9Y2BaCuO5. Similar diffraction studies of the HxY2BaZnO5 system indicate the presence of a solid solution phase to x = 2.0, which is the maximum hydrogen content so far achieved for this oxide; here V(H)BAR is also approximately zero. Neither hydriding reaction is reversible and attempts to remove hydrogen at elevated temperatures lead to the evolution of water and a partial reduction of the compound. IR absorption experiments for the Hx(D(x))Y2BaCuO5 system in the solid solution region indicate that hydrogen (deuterium) is most likely bound to both oxygen and copper. IR studies of H0.3Y2BaZnO5 show the presence of OH (hydroxyl) type bonding only.

Here, a sequential chemical etching and pyrolysis strategy are developed to prepare molybdenum carbide-decorated metallic cobalt@nitrogen-doped porous carbon polyhedrons (denoted as Mo/Co@N-C) hybrids for enhanced electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. The obtained metallic Co nanoparticles are coated by N-doped carbon thin layers while the formed molybdenum carbide nanoparticles are well-dispersed in the whole Co@N-C frames. Benefiting from the additionally implanted molybdenum carbide active sites, the HER performance of Mo/Co@N-C hybrids is significantly promoted compared with the single Co@N-C that is derived from the pristine ZIF-67 both in alkaline and acidic media. As a result, the as-synthesized Mo/Co@N-C hybrids exhibit superior HER electrocatalytic activity, and only very low overpotentials of 157 and 187 mV are needed at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively, opening a door for rational design and fabrication of novel low-cost electrocatalysts with hierarchical structures toward electrochemical energy storage and conversion.									106	4	0	0	10	0	108			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000430398600019	29571215

Highly crystalline nitrogen-doped phosphorene (N-phosphorene) is prepared using a combination of ball milling and microwave techniques. The prepared N-doped phosphorene nanosheets showed outstanding electrocatalytic performance as a new type of non-metallic catalyst for nitrogen (N-2) to ammonia (NH3) conversion, with an NH(3)yield rate and faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 18.79 mu g h(-1)mg(CAT)(-1)and 21.51%, respectively, at a low overpotential (0 V)versusthe reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Density functional theory calculations revealed that the high nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) FEs originate from the increased hydrophobicity at the N and O doped phosphorene surfaces, which in turn hinders the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an alkaline environment and promotes the NRR. This work not only introduces an efficient strategy to chemically functionalize 2D phosphorene, but also opens a new avenue in using N-doped phosphorene nanosheets as a metal-free catalyst.									55	6	0	0	4	0	55			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000560225400044

BaTiO3 is a wide-gap n-type semiconductor having a band gap of 3.0 eV. Doping Rh species into the lattice of BaTiO3 resulted in the formation of new absorption bands in visible light region. Upon visible light (lambda > 420 nm), BaTiO3:Rh modified with nanoparticulate Pt as a water reduction promoter was capable of producing H-2 from water containing an electron donor such as methanol and iodide. The best material prepared by the PC method exhibited higher activity than that made by a conventional solid-state reaction method. Visible-light-driven Z-scheme water splitting was also accomplished using Pt/BaTiO3:Rh as a building block for H-2 evolution in combination with PtOx-loaded WO3 as an O-2 evolution photocatalyst in the presence of an IO3-/I- shuttle redox mediator. Photoelectrochemical analysis indicated that a porous BaTiO3:Rh electrode exhibited cathodic photoresponse due to water reduction in a neutral aqueous Na2SO4 solution upon visible light.									119	7	0	0	7	0	122			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000331493200111	24410048

In the present work, a comprehensive and thermodynamically consistent micro-kinetic modeling was carried out for the DRM reaction under different reaction conditions. In order to reveal the complicated kinetics evolution, a rigorous descriptor (H2O/H-2) and a rough descriptor (CO2/CH4) were identified due to their correlations with the theta(o)/theta(*) ratio, dominant reaction pathway (DRP) and kinetically relevant steps (KRS). Moreover, the evolution of DRP and KRS along the descriptors under different reaction conditions were elucidated using the combined analyses of reaction pathway, sensitivity and partial equilibrium. It shows that at the high temperature, DRM is predominated by the first C-H bond rupture via the direct and/or O*-assisted mode; CO2 adsorption becomes kinetically relevant at the low descriptor. At the high total pressure, (CH2* + *) and (CH4* + O* would become the KRS at the low and high descriptors, respectively. In the end, hierarchical chemistry reduction gave two reduced mechanisms and an overall kinetics equation, with which main kinetics features could be predicted. Concept of descriptors seems to be generalized into other oxidation chemistries (e.g., steam reforming, RWGS and oxidative dehydrogenation) and provides insights into the reactor design and reaction optimization.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000417659400043

By contrast, urea electrolysis offers the prospect of energy-saving H-2 production together with urea-rich wastewater purification, whereas the lack of inexpensive and efficient urea oxidation reaction (UOR) catalysts places constraints on the development of this technique. Here we report a porous rod-like NiMoO4 with high oxidation states of the metal elements enabling highly efficient UOR electrocatalysis, which can be readily produced through annealing solid NiMoO(4)xH(2)O as a starting precursor in Ar. This precursor gives the derived Ni/NiO/MoOx nanocomposite when switching the shielding gas from Ar to H-2/Ar, exhibiting platinum-like activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes. Assembling an electrolytic cell using our developed UOR and HER catalysts as the anode and cathode can provide a current density of 10 milliamperes per square centimeter at a cell voltage of mere 1.38 volts, as well as remarkable operational stability, representing the best yet reported noble-metal-free urea electrolyser. Our results demonstrate the potential of nickel-molybdenum-based materials as efficient electrode catalysts for urea electrolysers that promises cost-effective and energy-saving H-2 production.									374	13	0	0	29	0	379			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000438392400024

Compared with the visible spectrum of lightning return strokes, the radiation order of lighting plasma is analyzed.and the main radiation mechanism of continuum spectra in the two wavelength range are also discussed. The obtained results show that: the visible spectrum of lightning is mainly radiation from early stages and development of lightning, and the line spectra of ionizing nitrogen and oxygen is the main spectra of the separation spectrum; the near-infrared spectrum is mainly radiation from the latter of the lightning, and the line spectra of neutral nitrogen and oxygen atoms is the main spectra of the separation spectrum; the visible spectral band is mainly from bremsstrahlung contribution and the infrared part of the continuous spectrum is mainly from the recombination radiation; loss of a photon for the free electronic of high-temperature and other energy particle collisions of the lightning plasma is the main course of bremsstrahlung process, there are a lot of free e-collision the lightning channel gathered in a large number of neutral atoms, molecules.electronics, and with the positively charged ions (including N .N .N* .N .O .O .O .O particles, etc.). thus forming a typical plasma channel: atmospheric ions and free electrons of the dissociation process and the positive ions and negative ion radiation process is the direct radiation of the two main ways. It is deduced from the results that the recombination in lightning plasma is the main process for lightning producing O and NOx the sorption and desorption of oxygen during the recombination may be the main reason for increased lines of oxygen atom in near-infrared spectra, and also for relative strength of OI 777.1 nm that is larger than normal.									7	6	0	0	1	0	9			1004-4213			INSPEC:11917441

Raman analysis showed that with increasing carbon, Q(3), Q(2)increased, Q(1), Q(0)decreased (Q(n),nis the number of bridge oxygen in a [SiO4]-tetrahedral unit), and then the degree of polymerization (i.e., the complexity of silicate slag network structure) increased. The time-temperature-transformation result showed that the incubation time first prolonged and then shortened with adding carbon, which was related to the form of carbon in slags. When carbon dissolved in slags, it reacted with O2-, increased viscosity, and then inhibited the crystallization property. When carbons existed in the particles form, it enhanced the heterogeneous nucleation and then the crystallization behavior. The crystallization kinetics research indicated that with the addition of carbon, the limiting factor of crystallization could be converted from interface reaction controlled to diffusion controlled and then to interface reaction controlled again. Concurrently, the activation energy of crystallization first increased from 370.36 to 446.61 kJ/mol and then reduced to 313.37 kJ/mol.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0972-2815	0975-1645		WOS:000568474800001

Among unfavourable factors the extreme temperatures influence directly the photosynthesis affecting the balance between photophysical reactions and biochemical processes. To cope with adverse stress environment plants developed different protective systems and mechanisms. In the chloroplast, the response to stress factors action involves inter thylakoid structural alterations, reorganization of main pigment-protein complexes and changes of the content and stoichiometry of photosystem I and photosystem II and their antenna complexes. Tomato is known as temperate climate culture and low temperature exerts negative impact on its functions and effectiveness of photosynthetic processes. In the present work the capability of tomato plants to acclimate to suboptimal temperature (12/10 degrees C) depending on the presence of high light intensity was studied. The overall performance of photosystem II was estimated using the rate of oxygen evolution in the presence of an exogenous electron acceptor and flash oxygen yields without added artificial electron acceptor. Under low growth temperature and high light conditions, these parameters were significantly reduced compared to values observed under control conditions, indicating that these conditions exhibit deleterious effect on photosystem II photochemical activity. The changes of energy supply of both photosystems were evaluated by analysis of 77 K chlorophyll emission and excitation spectra of isolated membranes. The decrease of the ratio E470/E436 under low temperature and high light could be explained by a decrease of antenna complex of photosystem II. The analysis of the basic photosynthetic processes reveals that all parameters are influenced by the low growth temperature in presence of high light intensity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1310-1331			WOS:000416296600008

Herein, the Co3O4/CuO nanoparticles were synthesized by a low-cost and simple approach using CuCo-based prussian blue analogue (PBA) as precursor of pyrolysis at different calcination temperatures. It was found that the Co3O4/CuO nanoparticles calcined at 600 degrees C (CCO-600) have relatively small size and superior ORR performance. The onset potential is 0.889 V and the diffusion limiting current density achieves 6.746 mA.cm(-2), as well as prominent stability in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte. The electron transfer number of the CCO-600 is 3.89 under alkaline medium, which indicates that the reaction mechanism of ORR is dominated by 4 e process similar to commercial Pt. The primary Mg-air battery with the CCO-600 as the cathode catalyst has been assembled and possesses better discharge performance than the CuCo-based PBA. The open circuit voltage of CCO-600 arrives at 1.76 V and the energy density reaches 1895.95 mWh/g.

MOF-Derived Hollow Tubular In2O3/MIIIn2S4 (MII: Ca, Mn, and Zn) Heterostructures: Synergetic Charge-Transfer Mechanism and Excellent Photocatalytic Performance to Boost Activation of Small Atmospheric Molecules								ACS APPLIED ENERGY MATERIALS				5	9			11002	11017		10.1021/acsaem.2c01670				SEP 26 2022	2022	The rational design of hierarchical In2O3/MIIIn2S4 (MII: Ca, Mn, and Zn) hollow tubular (HT) heterostructures was successfully performed by the preferential growth of ternary metal sulfide (MIIIn2S4) two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets on MIL-68(In) metal-organic framework (MOF) derived hollow tubular In2O3 using a facile low-temperature reflux reaction. The efficiency of HT-In2O3/MIIIn2S4 binary heterojunctions was studied for the photocatalytic activation of small atmospheric molecules. The ultrafast interfacial charge migration, better photoexcited charge separation, and significantly improved photocatalytic H2, NH3, and H2O2 production could be attributed to the narrow band gap energy of the MIIIn2S4 and S-scheme electron migration mechanism between In2O3 and MIIIn2S4 components in the heterostructures. Thanks to its structural and compositional advantages, the optimal HT-In2O3/MIIIn2S4 (1:1) heterostructure photocatalysts exhibited outstanding photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction and nitrogen and oxygen reduction reaction activity under visible-light illumination. Among the HT-In2O3/MIIIn2S4 (1:1) hetrostructures, the HT-In2O3/ZnIn2S4 (1:1) photocatalyst displayed the highest H2, NH3, and H2O2 generation (5331, 870, and 5716 mu mol g-1 h-1) with conversion efficiency of 34%, 6.5%, and 0.291%, respectively. This study offers a comprehensive analysis on how the coupling of three different d0, d5, and d10 ternary metal chalcogenides MIIIn2S4 with HT-In2O3 affects the photocatalytic H2, NH3, and H2O2 production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000862382400001

Recently, scientists began to explore the use of earth-rich transition metalbased materials to replace precious metal-based catalysts. Transition metals (TMs) based nickel (Ni) and their pnictides compounds such as phosphides and selenides exhibit good activity for hydrogen evaluation reaction (HER) and the entire water electrolysis process. In this study, we first prepared Ni(OH)2 and grown its layer on Ni foam (NF) and treated it with selenide (Se) and phosphide (P) then nickel-based selenide-phosphide catalyst (Ni-P-Se) was prepared by simultaneous selenization and phosphidation process for the first time. The asobtained composite was then analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), elemental mapping and transmission electron microscope (TEM) means to study the composition, structure, and micro-morphology of materials. Furthermore, we also observed electrocatalytic water splitting activity using electrochemical cell. The results of electrochemical tests depicted that the selenization and phosphidation treatments significantly enhanced the electrocatalytic HER activity of the starting materials. The overpotentials required for Ni-P-Se to reach 10 mA cm-2 and 100 mA cm-2 were only 242 mV and 282 mV. The Tafel slope of Ni-P-Se is 151 mV dec-1, which is lower than that of nickel phosphide, selenide, and hydroxide indicating that selenide-phosphide enhances the HER reaction kinetics of the material, which in turn increases hydrogen output rate as compared with previous studies.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0019-4522			WOS:000795936800020

Herein, vertically aligned and interconnected NiS2/CoS2/MoS2 nanosheet arrays on Ni foam were prepared by a two-step procedure that conducted by the hydrothermal synthesis of Ni-Co molybdate nanosheet array as the precursor and followed by the vapor phase sulfurization to achieve in situ conversion. Basing on the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations, it can be found that the honeycomb-like structure of the Ni-Co molybdate nanosheet array was well preserved after the sulfurization process. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) characterization reveals that the NiS2/CoS2/MoS2 nanosheet array provided abundant well-exposed active edge sites and multiple heterointerfaces towards enhanced alkaline HER performance. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that the ultrathin NiS2/CoS2/MoS2 nanosheets exhibited excellent HER performance with an overpotential of 112 mV at 10 mA cm(2) and a smaller Tafel slope of 59 mV dec(1) in comparison with NiS2/MoS2 (155 mV and 89 mV dec(1)) and CoS2/MoS2 (124 mV and 75 mV dec(1)) samples by taking the advantage of the well-exposed multiple heterointerfaces. This work presents a facile and reliable synthetic strategy for the rational design of highly efficient electrocatalysts for the HER in alkaline solution based on non-precious metal sulfide nanocomposite.

J	Silvaggi, NR; Anderson, JW; Brinsmade, SR; Pratt, RF; Kelly, JA								The crystal structure of phosphonate-inhibited D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase reveals an analogue of a tetrahedral transition state								BIOCHEMISTRY				42	5			1199	1208		10.1021/bi0268955				FEB 11 2003	2003	D-Alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases (DD-peptidases) are P-lactam-sensitive enzymes that are responsible for the final peptidoglycan cross-linking step in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. A highly specific tripeptide phosphonate inhibitor was designed with a side chain corresponding to a portion of the Streptomyces R61 peptidoglycan. This compound was found to be a slow, irreversible inactivator of the DD-peptidase. Molecular modeling suggested that although a pentacoordinated intermediate of the phosphonylation reaction would not interact strongly with the enzyme, a tetracoordinated phosphonyl enzyme might be analogous to a transition state in the reaction with peptide substrates. To investigate this possibility, the crystal structure of the phosphonyl enzyme was determined. The 1.1 Angstrom resolution structure shows that the inhibitor has phosphonylated the catalytic serine (Ser62). One of the phosphonyl oxygens is noncovalently bound in the oxyanion hole, while the other is solvated by two water molecules. The conserved hydroxyl group of Tyr159 forms a strong hydrogen bond with the latter oxygen atom (2.77 Angstrom). This arrangement is interpreted as being analogous to the transition state for the formation of the tetrahedral intermediate in the deacylation step of the carboxypeptidase reaction. The proximity of Tyr159 to the solvated phosphonyl oxygen suggests that the tyrosine anion acts as a general base for deacylation. This transition state analogue structure is compared to the structures of noncovalent DD-peptidase reaction intermediates and phosphonylated beta-lactamases. These comparisons show that specific substrate binding to the peptidase induces a conformational change in the active site that places Ser62 in an optimal position for catalysis. This activated conformation relaxes as the reaction proceeds.									55	0	0	0	49	0	58			0006-2960			WOS:000180847000003	12564922

However, the mechanism and magnitude of Neoproterozoic oxygenation remain uncertain. We present Fe isotopes, Fe species and other geochemical data for two sections of the Doushantuo Formation (ca. 635-551 Ma) deposited after the Nantuo glacial episode in the Yangtze Gorge area, South China. It is highlighted that highly positive delta Fe-56 values reflect a lower oxidation rate of Fe(II)(aq) under ferruginous conditions, and in turn near zero delta Fe-56 values indicate oxidizing conditions. Our study suggests that during the deposition of the bottom of Member II of the Doushantuo Formation the shallow seawater was oxic, but the deep water was characterized by ferruginous conditions, which is consistent with a redox chemical stratification model. Subsequent anoxic conditions under shallow seawater, represented by positive delta Fe-56 and negative delta C-13(carb) excursions, should be ascribed to the upwelling of Fe(II)(aq) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-rich anoxic deep seawater. The oxidation of Fe (II)(aq) and DOC-rich anoxic deep seawater upon mixing with oxic shallow water provides an innovative explanation for the well-known negative delta C-13(carb) excursions (ENC2) and positive delta Fe-56 excursions in the middle of Doushantuo Formation. Meanwhile, the upwelling Fe (II)(aq)- and DOC-rich anoxic deep seawater could increase photosynthetic activity. The balance between oxygen consumption and production was most important criteria for the oxygenation of Early Ediacaran Ocean and diversity of eukaryotic organisms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding Combustion of H-2/O-2 Gases inside Nanobubbles Generated by Water Electrolysis Using Reactive Molecular Dynamic Simulations								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				122	24			5261	5269		10.1021/acs.jpca.8b01798				JUN 21 2018	2018	This work explored the mechanism of spontaneous combustion of hydrogen-oxygen mixtures inside nanobubbles (which were generated by water electrolysis) using reactive molecular dynamic simulations based on the first-principles derived reactive force field ReaxFF. The effects of surface-assisted dissociation of H-2 and O-2 gases that produced H and O radicals were examined. Additionally, the ignition outcome and species evolution as a function of the initial system pressure (or bubble size) were studied. A significant amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 6-140 times water (H2O), was observed in the combustion products. This was attributed to the low-temperature (similar to 300 K) and high-pressure (2-80 atm) conditions at which the chemical reactions were taking place. In addition, the rate of consumption of H-2 and O-2 molecules was found to increase with an increase in added H and O radical concentrations and initial system pressure. The rate at which heat was being lost from the combustion chamber (nanobubbles) was also compared to the rate at which heat was being released from the chemical reactions. Only a slight rise in the reaction temperature was observed (similar to 68 K), signifying that, at such small scales, heat losses dominate. The resulting chemistry was quite different from macroscopic combustion, which usually takes place at a much higher temperatures of above 1000 K.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1089-5639	1520-5215		WOS:000436379600003	29804457

Alcohols react thermally and photolytically with 11a-c with losses of N-2 to yield 2-alkoxynaphthenones (24a,b and 47a,b) and acenaphthenones (25 and 48a,b). Aniline and diphenylamine are converted by 11a-c at 180 degreesC to acenaph[1,2-b]indoles (29a,b and 53a,b). Thermolyses of 11a-c at -450 degreesC (0.15 mmHg) yield reduction products 25 and 48a,b, respectively. Wolff rearrangements to 1,8-naphthyleneketenes (15a-d) and/or their derivatives are not observed in the above experiments. Oxygen converts 11a-c thermally to acenaphthenequinones (19a-c) and/or 1,8-naphthalic anhydrides. Insertion, addition, substitution, and/or isomerization reactions occur upon irradiation of 2-diazoacenaphthenones in cyclohexane, benzene, and tetrahydrofuran. Photolysis of 11d in benzene in the presence Of O-2 yields the insertion-oxidation product 2-hydroxy-5,6-dinitro-2phenylacenaphthenone (60). Photolyses of 11a-c in nitriles result in N-2 evolution and dipolar cycloaddition to give acenaph[1,2-d]oxazoles (41 and 61a,b). Acetylenes undergo thermal and photolytic cycloaddition/1,5-sigmatropic rearrangement reactions with 11a-d with N2 retention to give pyrazolo[5,1-a]quinolin-7-ones (69f-j). 2-Diazoacenaphthenones 1a and 11a react thermally and photolytically with electronegatively-substituted olefins with N-2 expulsion to yield (E)(-) and (Z)-2-oxospiro[acenaphthylene-1(2H),1'cyclopropanes] 73a-c and 74a-c, respectively.

However, inevitable effects from the inherent properties of weak absorption under the visible light and easy recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes within Bi2O3 have meaningfully restricted their applications in photocatalysis researches. In this study, 2D Sb2MoO6 and 2D polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) were designed as the Z-scheme heterojunction in the construction of 2D-hybridized PCN/Sb2MoO6/Bi2O3 dual Z-scheme structure. The degradation rate and the efficiency of oxygen generation of the newly obtained specimen demonstrated an obviously large increase in comparison to the efficiency of Bi2O3 under visible-light condition. The remarkable photocatalytic activity of PCN/Sb2MoO6/Bi2O3 could be attributed to the promotion of visible-light absorption range and the effective separation of photo-generated carriers by the dual Z-scheme heterojunction, proved with DRS analysis and VASP calculation. The band structure of PCN/Sb2MoO6/Bi2O3 was built on experimental data and VASP theoretical calculation. A possible transfer path of charge carriers and the construction mechanism of the dual Z-scheme heterojunction were also proposed through this band structure. Our research provides a potential method to strengthen the visible-light absorption of photocatalytic materials with molybdate, illustrating the influences of heterojunctions in the enhancement of the separation of photo-generated carriers. It has a great guiding significance for the further analysis of photocatalytic water splitting oxygen evolution.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2398-4902			WOS:000635734300001

The changes in the partial pressures of the reactants (CO and NO) and products (N-2 and CO2) as a function of time have been used as a measure of the evolution of the uptake and desorption rates, respectively, for temperatures between 350 and 1000 K and for NO:CO mixture ratios between 4:1 and 1:99 Post-mortem temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and CO titration experiments were also performed in order to estimate the surface coverages of atomic nitrogen and oxygen left on the Rh(111) surface by the gas mixture. Systematic variations were observed during the transition from the clean surface to the steady-state catalytic regime that correlate well with the overall reaction rates in the latter. Specifically, there is a time delay in the production of molecular nitrogen because of the need to build up a threshold atomic nitrogen coverage on the surface before the start of the desorption of Nz. This atomic nitrogen coverage, as calculated by the time delay in the transient, corresponds to that estimated by TPD after the reaction, and displays a dependence on the NO:CO ratio in the reaction mixture, increasing at a given temperature as the beam becomes richer in CO. Initial sticking coefficients were also determined for both NO and CO in NO + CO mixtures asa function of surface temperature and beam composition.									56	1	0	0	0	1	58			1089-5647			WOS:000086599700026

State-to-state dissociation and recombination modeling in DSMC using quasi-classical trajectory calculations for O + O2								2018 AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting								17 pp.	17 pp.						2018	2018	A state-based approach is used to model dissociation and recombination reactions for O + O2 collisions using cross-section data from quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) calculations. The dissociation cross section data are fit to a functional form and interpolated for implementation in a DSMC (direct simulation Monte Carlo) solver. The QCT dissociation probabilities are expressed in terms of these cross sections. A two-step binary collision (TSBC) model employing detailed balance and microscopic reversibility is used to characterize the recombination probabilities in terms of the dissociation cross sections. The QCT database used in this work is rotationally-averaged, and as such will mainly assess the effect of the vibrational mode on dissociation and recombination. The performance of state-based dissociation and recombination models is assessed through comparisons to two phenomenological DSMC models: the total collision energy (TCE) model and the quantum-kinetic (QK) model. Comparisons are made using the following quantities: equilibrium total dissociation and recombination rates, equilibrium state-specific dissociation and recombination rates, nonequilibrium total dissociation rates. The evolution of temperatures, state distributions and number densities are also compared through a non-equilibrium isothermal heating case.					2018 AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting2018 AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting	8-12 Jan. 20188-12 Jan. 2018		Kissimmee, FL, USAKissimmee, FL, USA	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-62410-524-1	INSPEC:17514417

The X-ray diffractogram demonstrates that NiO, LaNiO3, and La2O3 were the phases present in Ni/La2O3 catalyst. The decomposition of ethane over Ni/La2O3 catalyst has been investigated using temperature-programmed reaction (TPRn). TPRn profile exhibited both low temperature and high temperature range of carbon deposition and indicated the production of H-2 and CH4 in the gas phase from decomposition of ethane. Methane may be evolved from hydrogenation of surface methyl group from the decay of ethylidyne intermediate. The content, type of carbon, and kinetics of reaction of carbon with oxygen were determined by using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Succeeding the regeneration of Ni/La2O3 catalyst after carbon deposition for three times with steam, this catalyst exhibited the similar TPRn spectra and had still initial activity toward ethane decomposition and carbon nanofibres production. Results of isothermal gasification of carbon nanofibres with steam at temperatures of 823-923 K showed that most of the carbon nanofibres are removed during reaction with steam.

SnCl(3-)is used simultaneously as a reducing agent and stabilizing agent. Auto-reducible complex formation between Sn and Bi using this approach has not been previously reported. A distorted pyramidal Bi-SnCl(3-)complex is found to form on the surface of the Bi metal NP which enables its incorporation into electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies of graphene nanoplatelets. These assemblies are shown to act as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to simultaneously suppress capacitance loss associated with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and enhance the activity of the V3+<-> V(2+)redox couple.

Numerous strategies have been used to increase the efficiency in photoelectricity (PE)/photoelectrochemistry (PEC) systems, involving enhancing charge transfers and active surface area. However, the efficiency of PE/PEC water splitting is still confined by the high overpotential of the PE/PEC reactions, unexpected loss of electron migration, and low stability of photocatalytic electrodes. Recently, various magnetically-enhanced techniques have emerged as promising strategies to improve the conversion efficiency of renewable energy. Herein, this work summarizes recent progress on magnetically-enhanced methods for promoting PEC water splitting performance. Then magnetism in the PE applications is discussed, such as magnetic sensors, modulators, and isolators. As a summary, future research directions and challenges of magnetic PEC with different magnetic effects and conditions are discussed for enhancing the PEC reactions.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2196-7350			WOS:000678822600001

However, their elementary reaction pathways during this process still have not been revealed. This paper selected the Ar-CH2COOH as a typical carboxyl group containing structure for the analysis of the reaction pathways and enhancement effect on the coal self-heating process by quantum chemistry calculations. The results indicate that the hydrogen atoms in carboxyl groups are the active sites, which undergo the oxidation process and self-reaction process during coal self-heating. They both have two elementary reactions, namely (i) the hydrogen abstraction of -COOH by oxygen and the decarboxylation of the -COO center dot free radical and (ii) the hydrogen abstraction of -COOH and its pyrolysis. The total enthalpy change and activation energy of the oxidation process are 76.93 kJ/mol and 127.85 kJ/mol, respectively, which indicate that this process is endothermic and will occur at medium temperatures. For the hydrogen abstraction of -COOH by hydrocarbon free radicals, the thermal parameters are 53.53 kJ/mol and 56.13 kJ/mol, respectively, which has the same thermodynamic properties as the oxidation process. However, for the pyrolysis, the thermal parameters are -42.53 kJ/mol and 493.68 kJ/mol, respectively, and is thus exothermic and would not occur until the coal reaches high temperatures. They affect heat accumulation greatly, generate carbon dioxide, and provide new active centers for enhancing the coal self-heating process. The results would be helpful for further understanding of the coal self-heating mechanism.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0008-4042	1480-3291		WOS:000406998100003

We have designed a fully parallel and distributed hardware/software implementation of the generalized optimization subroutine PIKAIA, which utilizes a genetic algorithm to provide an objective determination of the globally optimal parameters for a given model against an observational data set. We have used this modeling tool in the context of white dwarf asteroseismology, i.e., the art and science of extracting physical and structural information about these stars from observations of their oscillation frequencies. The efficient, parallel exploration of parameter-space made possible by genetic-algorithm-based numerical optimization led us to a number of interesting physical results: (1) resolution of a hitherto puzzling discrepancy between stellar evolution models and prior asteroseismic inferences of the surface helium layer mass for a DBV white dwarf; (2) precise determination of the central oxygen mass fraction in a white dwarf star, and (3) a preliminary estimate of the astrophysically important but experimentally uncertain rate for the C-12(alpha, gamma) O-16 nuclear reaction. These successes suggest that a broad class of computationally intensive modeling appfications could also benefit from this approach. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, Jing; Chen, Yangshen; Zhang, Shishi; Yang, Chao; Zhang, Jun-Ye; Su, Yaqiong; Zheng, Gengfeng; Fang, Xiaosheng								Controllable States and Porosity of Cu-Carbon for CO2 Electroreduction to Hydrocarbons								SMALL				18	37					2202238	10.1002/smll.202202238		AUG 2022		SEP 2022	2022	The electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value-added chemical products is an effective strategy for both greenhouse effect mitigation and high-density energy storage. However, controllable manipulation of the oxidation state and porous structure of Cu-carbon based catalysts to achieve high selectivity and current density for a particular product remains very challenging. Herein, a strategy derived from Cu-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for the synthesis of controllable oxidation states and porous structure of Cu-carbon (Cu-pC, Cu2O-pC, and Cu2O/Cu-pC) is demonstrated. By regulating oxygen partial pressure during the annealing process, the valence state of the Cu and mesoporous structures of surrounding carbon are changed, leads to the different selectivity of products. Cu2O/CuO-pC with the higher oxidation state exhibits FEC2H4 of 65.12% and a partial current density of -578 mA cm(-2), while the Cu2O-pC shows the FECH4 over 55% and a partial current density exceeding -438 mA cm(-2). Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that porous carbon-coated Cu2O structures favor the CH4 pathway and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides an effective strategy for exploring the influence of the various valence states of Cu and mesoporous carbon structures on the selectivity of CH4 and C2H4 products in CO2RR.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000840896600001	35973948

The spatial and temporal evolution of discharge products were analyzed first. Then, the species distribution, Mach number, thrust wall pressure, and whole history of detonation formation were examined in detail. Results showed that the shapes of the temporal and spatial distribution of discharge products do not change when equivalence ratio varies in one discharge cycle. However, due to the variation of the percentage of fuel and oxidizer, and its impact on the discharge elementary reactions, the number density of every key active particle declines while the decline amplitude decreases when equivalence ratio rises. Although the magnitudes of species concentration are not altered by the plasma, the reacted region extends towards the downstream flow more quickly. The influence of equivalence ratio on plasma assisted detonation initiation becomes remarkable until late in the subsonic stage of the flowfield evolution process in the combustor under a rich burn condition. Furthermore, a larger equivalence ratio leads to a better accelerating effect of the plasma. Through analyzing the dynamic process of thrust wall pressure, it is also found that the DDT process is expedited more notably under a larger equivalence ratio, yet the magnitude of pressure is independent of the plasma. The provision of active particles for the combustion reaction by the plasma and its dilution effect on the fuel are the two intrinsic reasons for the reduction of DDT time and distance and the increase of this reduction degree, when equivalence ratio rises.

J	Kodentsov, A.								Diffusion-Limited Reactions of Non-Oxide Ceramics with Transition Metals								Diffusion Foundations				21				85	126		10.4028/www.scientific.net/DF.21.85				2019	2019	Thermodynamic and diffusion models are given to describe morphological evolution of the reaction zone during diffusion-limited interaction between non-oxide Si-containing ceramics (SiC and Si3N4) and transition metals (Cr, Mo, Ti, Ni, Co, Pt). In the case of diffusion-controlled process in the ternary metal-ceramic systems, reaction phenomena can be rationalized using chemical potential diagrams. However, in some cases, a periodic layered morphology is found in the transition zone, which is not fully understood, and it is difficult to predict apriori. Silicide formation in systems based on dense Silicon Nitride and non-nitride forming metals can be explained by assuming a nitrogen pressure build-up at the contact surface. This pressure determines the chemical potential of Silicon at the interface, and hence, the product phases in the diffusion zone. Traces of Oxygen in the ambient atmosphere might affect the interaction in non-oxide ceramic/transition metal systems. The thermodynamic stability of the condensed phases in the systems where volatile species may form can be interpreted using predominant area-type diagrams.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2296-3650			INSPEC:19216085

Although numerous efforts have been made, the fabrication of well-defined ultrathin bimetallic nanosheet assemblies (NSAs) at large scale is still a tough challenge. Herein, a universal synthetic approach has been proposed to produce a series of well-defined Pd-pm (pm = Ga, In, Sn, Pb, Bi) alloy NSAs. Due to multiple merits of their unique 3D flower-like nanostructure and alloyed crystalline features, the self-supported Pd-pm NSAs show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR). Given the eco-friendly synthetic concept, facile universality, and outstanding electrocatalytic properties of the generated bimetallic Pd-pm NSAs, we believe that this method could be employed for building more advanced nanocatalysts toward efficient electrocatalytic applications.									29	0	0	0	0	0	29			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000516533300052	31989139

Herein, two-coordinated-N vacancies are selectively introduced into the C3N4 framework by a facile Cl- modification method, whereas its concentration can be facilely tuned by varying Cl- usage in the process of thermal polymerization. Impressively, the optimal defective C3N4 (20 mg) exhibited superior hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates of 48.2 and 21.8 mu mol h(-1), respectively, in photocatalytic overall water splitting and an apparent quantum efficiency of 6.9% at 420 nm, the highest of reported single-component C3N4 photocatalysts for overall water splitting. Systematic studies including XPS, DFT simulations, and NEXAFS reveal that Cl- modification preferentially facilitates the introduction of two-coordinated-N vacancies through tuning the formation energy and promotes charge carrier separation efficiency, thereby greatly enhancing the photocatalytic efficiency. This work allows for a viable approach to rationally designing defective C3N4 for efficient photocatalysis.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000744461100001	35029973

The weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) numerical scheme with a relatively low resolution grid is employed. A detailed elementary chemical reaction model with 9 species and 19 elementary reactions is used for a stoichiometric oxy-hydrogen mixture diluted with argon. In this work, we study the effect of area expansion and contraction on the main/gross features of the detonation cellular structures in the presence of detonation reflection, diffraction and localized explosion. The result shows that there exists a transition region as the detonation wave propagates through the converging/diverging chamber. Within the transition region, the initial regular detonation cells become distorted and irregular before they re-obtain their regularity. While the ultimate regular cell size and the length of the transition region are strongly affected by the converging/diverging angle, the width/length ratio of the cells is fairly independent of it. A localized explosion near the wall is found as the detonation wave propagates in the diverging chamber.									10	3	1	0	0	0	13			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000258324300006

Solar energy, a sustainable and clean energy source, can supply the kinetic energy to increase the rates of catalytic reactions. In this regard, understanding of the underlying fundamental mechanisms of the photo/electrochemical process is critical for future development. Combining light-absorbing materials with catalysts has become essential to maximizing the efficiency of hydrogen production. To fabricate an efficient absorber-catalysts system, it is imperative to fully understand the vital role of surface/interface modulation for enhanced charge transfer/separation and catalytic activity for a specific reaction. The electronic and chemical structures at the interface are directly correlated to charge carrier movements and subsequent chemical adsorption and reaction of the reactants. Therefore, rational surface modulation can indeed enhance the catalytic efficiency by preventing charge recombination and prompting transfer, increasing the reactant concentration, and ultimately boosting the catalytic reaction. Herein, the authors review recent progress on the surface modification of nanomaterials as photo/electrochemical catalysts for water reduction and oxidation, considering two successive photogenerated charge transfer/separation and catalytic chemical reactions. It is expected that this review paper will be helpful for the future development of photo/electrocatalysts.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				1420-3049		WOS:000534617300115	32340202

Compared to Pd/C, Pd/TaC-G exhibits remarkably enhanced catalytic activity, resistance to poisonous intermediates and durability for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs). Experimental results from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveal the synergetic chemical coupling between the Pd nanoparticles and the TaC/RGO nanosheet hybrid, which is likely the reason for the enhanced catalytic activity of Pd/TaC-G. This work established a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of the noble metal catalyst through improving the catalytic activity, resistance to poisonous intermediates and durability via a two-dimensional hybrid, providing a new approach to develop the next generation catalysts in DMFCs.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000384876400010

Alkaline water electrolyzers allow using non-noble and low-cost materials. An analysis of common assumptions and experimental conditions (low concentrations, low temperature, low current densities, and short-term experiments) found in the literature is reported. The steps to estimate the reaction overpotentials for hydrogen and oxygen reactions are reported and discussed. The results of some of the most investigated electrocatalysts, namely from the iron group elements (iron, nickel, and cobalt) and chromium are reported. Past findings and recent progress in the development of efficient anode and cathode materials appropriate for large-scale water electrolysis are presented. The experimental work is done involving the direct-current electrolysis of highly concentrated potassium hydroxide solutions at temperatures between 30 and 100 degrees C, which are closer to industrial applications than what is usually found in literature. Stable cell components and a good performance was achieved using Raney nickel as a cathode and stainless steel 316L as an anode by means of a monopolar cell at 75 degrees C, which ran for one month at 300 mA cm(-2). Finally, the proposed catalysts showed a total kinetic overpotential of about 550 mV at 75 degrees C and 1 A cm(-2).									59	1	1	0	2	0	59			1996-1944			WOS:000467767400142	31022944

Here we discover mutations that substantially slow the rate but not the yield of this posttranslational modification, determine structures of the trapped precyclization intermediate and oxidized postcyclization states, and identify unanticipated features critical to chromophore maturation. The protein architecture contains a dramatic approximate to80degrees bend in the central helix, which focuses distortions at G67 to promote ring formation from amino acids S65, Y66, and G67. Significantly, these distortions eliminate potential helical hydrogen bonds that would otherwise have to be broken at an energetic cost during peptide cyclization and force the G67 nitrogen and S65 carbonyl oxygen atoms within van der Waals contact in preparation for covalent bond formation. Further, we determine that under aerobic, but not anaerobic, conditions the Gly-Gly-Gly chromophore sequence cyclizes and incorporates an oxygen atom. These results lead directly to a conjugation-trapping mechanism, in which a thermodynamically unfavorable cyclization reaction is coupled to an electronic conjugation trapping step, to drive chromophore maturation. Moreover, we propose primarily electrostatic roles for the R96 and E222 side chains in chromophore formation and suggest that the T62 carbonyl oxygen is the base that initiates the dehydration reaction. Our molecular mechanism provides the basis for understanding and eventually controlling chromophore creation.									154	0	1	0	103	0	159			0027-8424			WOS:000186024300035	14523232

Both the advanced X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation validate that Cl doping can optimize the electronic structure and the intrinsic activity of Ni3S2.

The method enables determination of the rates of CO2 fixation, photorespiration and respiration in the light under steady-state photosynthesis and discrimination between primary and stored photosynthates as substrates of photorespiratory and respiratory decarboxylations. The method is based on the analysis of the time curves of (CO2)-C-14 evolution from labeled primary and stored photosynthates in leaves previously exposed to (CO2)-C-14. The molar rates of different decarboxylation reactions are calculated from the initial slopes of the curves taking into account the specific radioactivity of CO2 fed to leaves and/or evolved from leaves. To estimate the contribution of primary and stored photosynthates, the measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution are performed after feeding plant leaves for different periods with (CO2)-C-14. Photorespiration and respiration are distinguished on the basis of data obtained from measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution under normal (210 ml l(-1)) and low (15 ml l(-1)) concentrations of oxygen. A principally new method for the determination of the rate of intracellular refixation of respiratory CO2 has been developed. The method is based on the measurements of (CO2)-C-14 evolution from leaves into the medium of very high concentrations (30 ml l 21) of (CO2)-C-12, where the probability of refixation of (CO2)-C-14 evolved inside the cell is close to zero. The results obtained were comparable with the data derived from parallel refixation measurements by means of gasometric methods. As an example of application, the data on CO2 exchange in leaves of two contrasting groups of C-3-species, differing in the ability of starch accumulation, are presented.									40	0	0	0	40	0	40			0031-9317	1399-3054		WOS:000242865700005

However, they still suffer severe challenges during the synthetic processes, such as a large amount of the capping agents adhering on the surface and easy occurrence of aggregation. To figure out these obstacles, Ar plasma treatment as a modified method in this study not only enable the TiO2 (B) nanosheets distributed uniformly on the GO sheets but also engineer defects within TiO2 (B) nanosheets to significantly improve the photocatalytic activity for the water splitting. The hydrogen evolution rate of the TiO2-x (B)/GO sheets is 1.4 times higher compared with that of original TiO2 (B)/GO sheets without Ar plasma treatment. The improved photocatalytic properties were owing to the synergetic effects of oxygen vacancies and the heterojunction between GO and TiO2 (B), which can promote the visible light utilization and accelerate separation and transportation of photogenerated electron-holes. This study can provide a facile pathway to prepare the two-dimensional hybrid photocatalysts with high photocatalytic H-2 activity.

Fe/N/C is a promising non-Pt electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but its catalytic activity is considerably inferior to that of Pt in acidic medium. In this paper, an improved Fe/N/S/C catalyst (denoted as Fe-N-S/C) is presented. Nitrogen-sulfur-iron-doped porous carbon material is synthesized by the pyrolysis of dicyandiamide, a kind of abundant and inexpensive compound, with thiourea as additional sulfur source in argon atmosphere. The Fe-N-S/C shows excellent performance for the ORR with the onset and half-wave potential at 0.89 and 0.78 V (vs. RHE) in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution, respectively, which are significantly higher compared to those of the catalysts derived from only dicyandiamide (0.85 and 0.75 V). Our results indicate that as compared to the commercial 20 % Pt/C catalyst, the synthesized catalyst exhibits not only higher current density and long-term durability but also higher tolerance to methanol poisoning. More importantly, the synthetic method is simple and inexpensive.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000392308700125

In this work, hierarchically porous N-doped carbon incorporated Mo-doped CoP nanosheet arrays are homogeneously grown on titanium foils (denoted as Mo-CoP/NC/TF) using a metal-organic-framework (MOF)-etching strategy. DFT simulations manifest that Mo dopants and N-doped carbon incorporation can synergistically modify the electronic structure of CoP, bringing optimal hydrogen adsorption free energies and accelerated interfacial charge transfer. Moreover, hierarchical nanoarray architectures can generate abundant accessible active sites, facile ion-diffusion path, and open-channels for gas release. Benefiting from these electronic and geometric advantages, the MoCoP/NC/TF electrocatalysts display superior activity and outstanding stability for pH-universal HER, requiring overpotentials of 59, 130, and 78 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, respectively, which rivals most of the state-of-the-art non-precious electrocatalysts. This work may inspire the design and exploration of highly active and durable electrocatalysts by synergistically tailoring electronic and geometric structures toward hydrogen evolution.									24	0	0	0	3	0	24			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000626508600002

In this study, a custom designed electrochemical cell is utilized to investigate planar polycrystalline copper as an electrocatalyst for CO reduction under alkaline conditions. Seven major CO reduction products have been observed including various hydrocarbons and oxygenates which are also common CO2 reduction products, strongly indicating that CO is a key reaction intermediate for these further-reduced products. A comparison of CO and CO2 reduction demonstrates that there is a large decrease in the overpotential for C-C coupled products under CO reduction conditions. The effects of CO partial pressure and electrolyte pH are investigated; we conclude that the aforementioned large potential shift is primarily a pH effect. Thus, alkaline conditions can be used to increase the energy efficiency of CO and CO, reduction to C-C coupled products, when these cathode reactions are coupled to the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode. Further analysis of the reaction products reveals common trends in selectivity that indicate both the production of oxygenates and C-C coupled products are favored at lower overpotentials. These selectivity trends are generalized by comparing the results on planar Cu to current state-of-the-art high-surface-area Cu catalysts, which are able to achieve high oxygenate selectivity by operating at the same geometric current density at lower overpotentials. Combined, these findings outline key principles for designing CO and CO2 electrolyzers that are able to produce valuable C-C coupled products with high energy efficiency.									170	8	0	0	19	0	169			2155-5435			WOS:000441112400064

Therefore, intensive efforts have been devoted to the exploration of efficient approaches for fabricating highly efficient electrocatalysts with appropriate H2O adsorption, such as defect engineering, interface engineering, and morphology design. Among them, metal doping, particularly noble metal (Ru, Rh, and Ir) doping, is essential to optimize the adsorption of reaction intermediates on the surface of catalysts, and has thus attracted increasing research interest. In order to uncover the significant role of noble metal doping in boosting water splitting electrocatalysis, this minireview showcases the most recent examples towards this endeavor, and begins by illustrating the mechanisms for water splitting and several advanced approaches for realizing noble metal doping. In the main text, we have also specifically highlighted the influences of noble metal doping on the electrocatalytic performance. Finally, some challenges and future outlooks are also presented to offer guidance for practical applications.									76	1	0	0	3	0	76			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000657796200001

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis were carried out before and after deformation of the samples. The results indicated that CO generated at 150 and 250 degC; the gas component was mostly oxygen (O2), with small amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and hydrogen (H2). At 50 degC, O2 and a little CO2 were observed and no CO was found. The carbon content of the coal samples increased slightly after deformation, and the oxygen content, H/C ratio, and O/C ratio decreased. The molecular structure of coal displayed different evolution characteristics at various temperatures. At 50 and 150 degC, the falling off of side chains, broken of ether bond and directional realignment of the aliphatic chains resulting in the formation of long chains were the main performance of coal molecular structure evolution. While at 250 degC, the side chains fell off and short chains formed. Furthermore, at both 150 and 250 degC, condensed degree of aromatic ring increased. Under the action of temperature and pressure, CO forms in two ways. The first is that ether bond breaks, oxygen and carbon atoms combine together and forms CO, or O2 forming in the broken of ether-oxygen bond leads to the oxidation of free radicals and resulting in the formation of CO. And the second is that CO derives from falling off of CO group. [All rights reserved Elsevier].									9	1	0	0	1	0	9			2095-2686			INSPEC:16221458

The robust and non-interpenetrated cationic MOF exemplifies a unique bifunctional scaffold for the efficient electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and ultrasensitive monitoring of biohazards. The microporous framework containing Bronsted acidfunctionalized [Co-2(mu(2)-OH)(CO2)(2)] secondary building units (SBUs) exhibits remarkable OER performance in 1 M KOH, requiring 410 mV overpotential to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) anodic current density, and a low Tafel slope of 55 mV/dec with 93.1% Faradaic efficiency. Apart from the high turnover frequency and electrochemically assessable surface area, steady OER performance over 500 cycles under potentiodynamic and potentiostatic conditions result in long-term catalyst durability. The highly emissive attribute from nitrogen-rich fluorescent struts benefits the MOF in recyclable and selective fluoro-detection of three biothiols (L-cysteine, homocysteine, and glutathione) in water with a fast response time. In addition to colorimetric monitoring in the solid and solution phases, control experiments validate size-exclusive biothiol speciation through molecular-dimension-mediated pore diffusion. The role of SBUs in the OER mechanism is detailed from density functional theory-derived free energy analysis, which also validates the importance of accessible N-sites in sensing via portraying framework-analyte supramolecular interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000820801300001	35728309

Approaches in homogeneous systems have been met with little success and the integration of molecular catalysts in photoelectrochemical cells is challenging due to inaccessibility and incompatibility of functional hybrid molecule/material electrodes with long-term stability in aqueous solution. Here, we present the first example of light-driven water splitting achieved with precious-metal-free molecular catalysts driving both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions. Mesoporous TiO2 was employed as a low-cost scaffold with long-term stability for anchoring a phosphonic acid-modified nickel(II) bis-diphosphine catalyst (NiP) for electrocatalytic proton reduction. A turnover number of 600 mol H-2 per mol NiP was achieved after 8 h controlled-potential electrolysis at a modest overpotential of 250 mV. X-ray photoelectron, UV-vis and IR spectroscopies confirmed that the molecular structure of the Ni catalyst remains intact after prolonged hydrogen production, thereby reasserting the suitability of molecular catalysts in the development of effective, hydrogen-evolving materials. The relatively mild operating conditions of a pH 3 aqueous solution allowed this molecule-catalysed cathode to be combined with a molecular Fe(II) catalyst-modified WO3 photoanode in a photoelectrochemical cell. Water splitting into H-2 and O-2 was achieved under solar light illumination with an applied bias of >0.6 V, which is below the thermodynamic potential (1.23 V) for water splitting and therefore allowed the storage of solar energy in the fuel H-2.									76	1	0	0	11	0	76			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000378715000007	30155045

Herein, we report on a family of rationally designed Mn-doped cobalt ferrite (MCF) spinel nanocrystals, with an optimal composition Mn-0.8(CoFe2)(073)O-4 (MCF-0.8), that are effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. MCF-0.8 exhibits a half wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.89 V vs RHE in 1 M NaOH, only 0.02 V less than that of commercial Pt/C under identical testing conditions and, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest recorded values in the literature. Moreover, MCF-0.8 exhibits remarkable durability (Delta E-1/2 = 0.014 V) after 10 000 electrochemical cycles. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that the superior performance of the trimetallic MCF-0.8 originates from the synergistic catalytic effect of Mn and Co, while Fe helps preserve the spinel structure during cycling. We employed in situ XAS to track the evolution of the oxidation states and the metal-oxygen distances not only under constant applied potentials (steady state) but also during dynamic cyclic voltammetry (CV) (nonsteady state). The periodic conversion between Mn(III, IV)/Co(III) and Mn(II, III)/Co (II) as well as the essentially constant oxidation state of Fe during the CV suggests collaboration efforts among Mn, Co, and Fe. Mn and Co serve as the synergistic coactive sites to catalyze the oxygen reduction, apparently resulting in the observed high activity, while Fe works to maintain the integrity of the spinel structure, likely contributing to the remarkable durability of the catalyst. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the electrocatalytic processes of trimetallic oxides under real-time fuel cell operating conditions. This approach provides a new strategy to design high-performance non-precious-metal electrocatalysts for alkaline fuel cells.									62	2	0	0	4	0	62			0002-7863			WOS:000461537700036	30789717

Experiments of pine and beech wood char conversion were carried out in a single particle combustor under conditions of 1473-1723 K, 0.0-10.5% O-2 , and 25-42% H2O. A comprehensive progressive char conversion model, including heterogeneous reactions (char oxidation and char gasification with CO2 and H2O), homogeneous reactions (CO oxidation, water-gas shift reaction, and H-2 oxidation) in the particle boundary layer, particle shrinkage, and external and internal heat and mass transfer, was developed. The modelling results are in good agreement with both experimental char conversion time and particle size evolution in the presence of oxygen, while larger deviations are found for the gasification experiments. The modelling results show that the char oxidation is limited by mass trans-fer, while the char gasification is controlled by both mass transfer and gasification kinetics at the investigated conditions. A sensitivity analysis shows that the CO oxidation in the boundary layer and the gasification kinetics influence significantly the char conversion time, while the water-gas shift reaction and H-2 oxidation have only a small effect. Analysis of the sensitive parameters on the char conversion process under a typical pulverized biomass combustion condition (4% O-2 , 13% CO2, 13% H2O), shows that the char gasification reactions contribute significantly to char conversion, especially for millimeter-sized biomass char particles at high temperatures.

Although ruthenium phosphide (RuP) has been hailed as a highly promising candidate, considerable performance disparity still lies between RuP and mainstream Pt/C benchmark, which calls for the structural regulation on RuP at molecular scale. Herein, for the first time, we develop a simple anion substitution strategy to obtain favorable strain regulation on RuP catalyst toward enhanced HER activity. The tensile strain enables an upshift of the d-orbital energy level of Ru site, facilitating hydrogen adsorption as well as water dissociation to accelerate the HER kinetics. Impressively, the as-developed N-RuP/NPC catalyst not only outperforms most of the reported Pt-free catalysts, showing record-high turnover frequencies of 1.56H(2) s(-1) and 0.72H(2) s(-1) at an overpotential of 30 mV in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively, but also surpasses the Pt/C benchmark with a significantly smaller overpotential (58.9 mV vs 73.1 mV in acidic electrolyte) at a large current density of 100 mA cm(-2). Beyond that, such atomic level regulation also suppresses the electrochemical reconstruction and thereby guarantees superior durability over 10000 cycles.									18	2	0	0	2	0	18			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300082

Herein, we account the fabrication of an in-situ formed M-BiVO4/T-BiVO4 (MT-BiVO4) isotype heterojunction by a simple co-precipitation method followed by altering the calcinations temperatures. The physico-chemical properties of the fabricated MT-BiVO4 isotype hetrojunctions were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-Visible Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) techniques. The FESEM image of MT-BiVO4 photodeposited by Au and MnOx particles was provided strong evidence for the spatial separation of photogenerated charge carriers between M and T phase of BiVO4 in an isotype heterojunction. The interfacing of T-BiVO4 with M-BiVO4 in an isotype heterojunction affords the well-built close contact between them was confirmed by the High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis. The photocatalytic reactions of all the prepared MT-BiVO4 isotype heterojunctions were examined by monitoring the degradation of Norfloxacine and oxygen evolution reaction under visible light irradiation. The optimized 65% MT-BiVO4 isotype heterojunction discloses higher photocatalytic activity around 91% of Norfloxacine degradation in 150 min and 808 mu mol of O-2 evolution in 2 h under visible light irradiation. On the other hand, the photoelectrochemical measurements reveals that the optimized 65% MT-BiVO4 isotype heterojunction exhibits superior photocurrent i.e. 584 mu A/cm(2) which is approximately 5.1 and 25.3 times higher than the neat T-BiVO4 and M-BiVO4, and these results are well consistent with the photocatalytic activities. The higher PEC and photocatalytic activities are due to the well-built close contact, superior compatibility and matching band structure between T-BiVO4 and M-BiVO4, which provides strapping driving force for the efficient enhancement of charge separation process. The Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photoluminescence (PL), photoelectrochemical (PEC) and bode analysis confirms the effectual diminish of charge recombination process in MT-BiVO4 isotype heterojunction relative to the neat materials. The chronoamperometric analysis authenticated that the isotype heterojunctions are more stable than the neat materials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

With increasing the concentration of MSA, the growth of alpha-phase PbO2 is preferred. Adsorption of MS ions on surface enhances the preferential orientations of alpha (0 2 0) and beta (3 0 1) planes, and favors the formation of dense and uniform PbO2 film with deposition time. The presence of Bi3+ ions in the baths facilitates the growth of beta-phase PbO2 instead of alpha phase, and at the same time, inhibits the formation of nonstoichiometric PbO2 by replacing the Pb (II) in the lattice defects. The improvement in both morphology and service lifetime is achieved by the low-level Bi inclusion. In contrast, the high-level Bi inclusion results in a shorten service lifetime and higher oxygen evolution current density.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that by constructing a transitional metal sulfide-MoS2 heterostructure, the HER performance of the MoS2-based catalysts can be further improved. It is even possible to obtain bifunctional catalysts for both HER and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the synergistic effect of the different components in the composite, the electronic effect to enable an efficient electron transfer and appropriate binding energy for the intermediates of the electrocatalytic reactions, and the surface defects on the interface of the heterostructures. Herein, we review the recent progress on the construction of the transitional metal sulfide-MoS2 heterostructure for water splitting based on non-self-supporting and self-supporting catalysts. The surface and interface parameters of the heterostructures are discussed in detail to reveal the key roles of the hybrid structures for energy conversion. We also pay special attention to the theoretical simulations based on first principles to clarify the relationships between the electrochemical performance and structure parameters. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the transition metal sulfide-MoS2 heterostructures for water splitting in the future are proposed to prompt the reasonable design of transition metal sulfide-MoS2 heterostructures for full water splitting.									49	2	0	0	1	0	50			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000614172600007

Cathodoluminescence imaging, ion-microprobe U-Pb and oxygen isotope results show evidence for an extensive period of complex zircon growth, secondary reaction and U-Pb isotopic disturbance from 4.36 to 3.90 Ga. In addition many of the zircons have discordant U-Pb systems and excess common Pb indicating a superimposed, relatively recent, reaction between radiation damaged zircon and low temperature fluids. The significance of oxygen isotope compositions for zircons with complex internal structures and U-Pb systems is complicated by uncertainty in the origin of the grains and the unknown effect of later reactions. However, a minority of grains with sharp oscillatory zoning, uniform and concordant U-Pb systems, igneous Th-U ratios and low common Pb contents, are interpreted as undisturbed primary magmatic zircons. The oldest identified, oscillatory zoned, magmatic grain, with an age 4363 +/- 20 Ma, is one of a few reported magmatic grains with this age, which is interpreted as the oldest reliable age for Hadean magmatic zircons. Mantle delta O-18 values are reported for these zircons. Younger oscillatory zoned zircon, including oscillatory zoned cores in complex grains, have delta O-18 values lower than 6.5 parts per thousand, which are within the range of ion microprobe analysed delta O-18 values for zircons in high temperature equilibrium with the normal mantle rocks of 5.3 +/- 0.6 parts per thousand (2 standard deviations). These values are also within the range of delta O-18 values found in lunar zircons. The absence of heavy oxygen in the grains that can be interpreted as primary magmatic zircons and the complex history over the period from 4.36 to 3.9 Ga, seen in all other Jack Hills zircons and reflected in the internal structures and U-Pb isotopic systems, questions the model for the early Earth involving long intervals of relatively temperate conditions from 4.4 to 4.0 Ga that were conducive to oceans and possibly life.

For example, the hydrogen evolution reaction begins with a simple proton discharge to a metal surface, but with conventional electronic structure methods, the simulated potential, which is manifested as the metal's workfunction, varies over the course of the simulation as the electron is consumed in the new metal hydrogen bond. Here, we present a simple approach to allow the direct control of the electrochemical potential via charging of the electrode surface. This is achieved by changing the total number of electrons in the self-consistent cycle, while enforcing charge neutrality through the introduction of a jellium counter charge dispersed in an implicit solvent region above the slab. We observe that the excess electrons localize selectively at the metal's reactive surface and that the metal workfunction responds nearly linearly to the variation in electronic count. This linear response allows for control of the potential in simulations with a minimal computational penalty compared to standard electronic structure calculations. This scheme can be straightforwardly implemented with common electronic structure calculators (density functional theory in the present work), and we find this method to be compatible with the commonly used computational hydrogen electrode model, which we expect will make it useful in the construction of potential-dependent free-energy diagrams in electrochemistry. We apply this approach to the proton-deposition (Volmer) step on both Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and show that we can reliably control the simulated electrode potential and thus assess the potential dependence of the initial, transition, and final states. Our method allows us to directly assess the location along the reaction pathway with the greatest amount of charge transfer, which we find to correspond well with the reaction barrier, indicating this reaction is a concerted proton-electron transfer. Interestingly, we show that the Pt electrode has not only a more favorable equilibrium energy with adsorbed hydrogen but also a lower intrinsic barrier under thermoneutral conditions.									68	1	0	0	7	0	68			1932-7447			WOS:000436381600022

Herein, high-performance metal-free P,N-doped carbon catalysts (P-N-GFs-HMPA) with the E-1/2 potential of about 0.78 V are successfully prepared by constructing porous foams using graphene oxides and carbon nanotubes as building bricks and hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) as the special precursor of P and N. Impressively, the HMPA compound not only facilitated the remarkable increase in the content of both P and N in the carbon frameworks, but also offered high density of the coupled N-P moieties embedded in the graphene surface. Together with the optimized local structures including open porosities and high electron transportation capacity, this foam exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the ORR in acidic medium. It is markedly superior to the previously reported metal-free carbons and comparable to Fe- or Co-based ORR carbon electrocatalysts. Thus we have successfully developed a high-performance metal-free ORR catalyst in acidic medium by precisely tuning the carbon structure through coupling with non-metal elements.									23	2	0	0	1	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000426704100038

In the actinides series, uranium(IV) oxalate U(C2O4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O can be viewed as a peculiar case, as its sensibility toward oxidation leads to a specific series of reactions when heating under an oxygen atmosphere. In order to clarify the disagreements existing in the literature, particularly concerning potential carbonate intermediates and the possible transitory existence of UO3, we show here an extended characterization of the different intermediates through a combination of X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopies and X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy. In this frame, uranium oxidation was found to occur at low temperature (200 degrees C) concomitantly to the onset of oxalate groups decomposition, leading to an amorphous oxo-oxalato compound. Pursuing the thermal conversion up to 350 degrees C led to complete oxidation of U(IV) into U(VI), then to the formation of amorphous UO3 still bearing adsorbed carbonates. The first pure oxide formed during the thermal conversion was further identified to substoichiometric UO3-delta after heating at 550 degrees C. Finally, U3O8 was obtained as the final stable phase after heating above 660 degrees C. The mechanism of thermal conversion of uranium(IV) oxalate into oxide under oxygen is then driven by a complex interplay between redox reactions and decomposition of the organic fractions. Such chemical reactions were also found to significantly modify the morphology of the powder through high-temperature environmental scanning electron microscopy observations: decomposition led to a 20% reduction in the size of the aggregates, while uranium oxidation clearly promoted growth within the agglomerates.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000541873600075	32484336

The as prepared Co@N-CNTs composite exhibited electroactivity and long-term stability toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in both alkaline and acidic solutions. It was found that the gradient temperature synthesis and reduction of the gels in the presence of glucose played an important role in the formation of a thin carbon shell on the Co nanoparticles, which protected it from being destroyed during the electrochemical procedures. These processes also facilitated to the ordered arrangement of nitrogen-carbon precursors and the formation of enriched pyridinic, pyrrolic and quaternary nitrogen functional groups that led to the highly activity of Co@N-CNTs. In addition, the catalyst also presented tolerance to methanol oxidation. This synthetic method and mechanism enlighten the future design of state-of-the-art nanostructured materials as an alternation for precious metal based catalysts for highly efficient ORR.

Herein we report the fabrication of a series of amorphous NiFeB nanoparticles with varying atomic ratios of Fe to (Ni + Fe) (chi(Fe)) by a facile chemical-reduction method. The amorphous NiFeB (chi(Fe) = 0.20) nanoparticles, combining the merits of in situ formation of borate-enriched NiFeOOH catalytic surface layers, intrinsic amorphous nanostructures, and an optimized degree of Fe doping, displayed highly active electrocatalytic performance towards the OER in a broad range of pH values (from alkaline to neutral conditions). The catalyst exhibited a relatively low overpotential of 216 mV with a Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec on Ni foam and 251 mV with a Tafel slope of 43 mV/dec on glassy carbon at 10 mA/cm(2) in a 1 M KOH solution, demonstrating much greater OER efficiency than that of commercial RuO2. Long-term stability testing of the OER performance of NiFeB (chi(Fe) = 0.20) by chronoamperometry (overpotential (eta) = 320 mV) over 200 h revealed no evidence of degradation. Facile, scalable synthesis and highly active water oxidation make the NiFeB nanoparticles very attractive for OER electrocatalysis.									107	10	0	0	0	0	110			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000424049300043

The electrocatalytic performance of electrode materials is closely bound with their intrinsic electronic/ionic states and crystal structures. Apart from the nanoscale design and conductive composite strategies, heteroatom doping, particularly for nonmetal doping (e.g., hydrogen, boron, sulfur, selenium, phosphorus, and tellurium), is also another effective strategy to greatly promote the intrinsic activity of the electrode materials by tuning their atomic structures. From the perspective of electrocatalytic reactions, the effective atomic structure regulation could induce additional active sites, create rich defects, and optimize the adsorption capability, thereby contributing to the promotion of the electrocatalytic performance of noble metal-based electrocatalysts. Encouraged by the great progress achieved in this field, we have reviewed recent advancements in nonmetal doping for electrocatalytic energy conversion. Specifically, the doping effect on the atomic structure and intrinsic electronic/ionic state is also systematically illustrated and the relationship with the electrocatalytic performance is also investigated. It is believed that this review will provide guidance for the development of more efficient electrocatalysts.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000667704200001	34184008

Tobacco plants in the six-leaf stage were exposed to 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 to determine the activities of photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) reaction centers, the blocking site of PSII electron transport, the degree of membrane peroxidation and the relative expression of PsbA, PsbO and PsaA genes in the third fully expanded leaves by using gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence techniques, biochemical and RT-PCR analysis. The results showed that 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 caused necrotic lesions to form on leaves and significantly increased the generation rate of superoxide anions (O-2(-)) and the content of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in leaves of tobacco seedling, leading to damage to cell membrane, chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate reduction, and photosynthetic apparatus destruction. Fumigation with 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 decreased the activity of PSII reaction center and oxygen evolution complex, and the relative expression of PabA in leaves of tobacco seedlings to inhibit the electron transport from the donor side to the receptor side of PSII, especially blocking the electron transport from QA to QB on the receptor side. The activity of the PSI reaction center and the relative expression of PsaA decreased, weakening the ability to accept electrons and inhibiting the electron transfer from PSII to PSI, which further increased the damage of PSII of tobacco seedling leaves caused by 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2. Therefore, 16.0 mu L L-1 NO2 leaded to the accumulation of O-2(-) and ONOO-, which damaged the cell membrane and thylakoid membrane, inhibit the electron transport, and destroyed the photosynthetic apparatus in leaves of tobacco seedlings. The results from this study emphasized the importance of reducing the NO2 concentration in the atmosphere.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			0147-6513	1090-2414		WOS:000525763800023	32247242

The temperature range investigated extended from 1178 K to 1523 K. As the Ce4+/Ce3+ peak potential is situated near the silicate oxidation wall, its position was determined more precisely by superimposing the theoretical peak on voltammetry diagram. The results were then used to develop a model relating the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox ratio to the oxygen fugacity, temperature and optical basicity. In its general expression, the relation accounts for the evolution predicted by the laws of thermodynamics, and is similar to the relations established for the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple by other authors.

Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library				3				D973	84						1998 Sep 01	1998	This short review describes the molecular evolution and phylogeny of various defense molecules participating in the host defense of horseshoe crab. It is well known that invertebrate animals, which lack adaptive immune systems, have developed various defense systems, so called innate immunity, that respond to common antigens on the surface of potential pathogens. The systems include hemolymph coagulation, melanization, cell agglutination, antimicrobial action, active oxygen formation, and phagocytic action. Among them, hemolymph coagulation and phenoloxidase-mediated melanization, in addition to cell agglutination, are directly induced by foreign substances, that result in the engulfment of invading microbes. The immobilized invaders are finally killed by antimicrobial substances released mainly from many kinds of hemocytes. In the past two decades, we have investigated biochemically various defense molecules, using horseshoe crab as a model animal, and established extensively their molecular structures. These results now make it possible to discuss evolution and phylogeny of the defense molecules at a molecular level, in comparison with those derived from vertebrate animals. Here, the authors will describe the present state of our knowledge concerning molecules mainly associated with innate immunity.									34	0	1	0	30	0	35			1093-9946			MEDLINE:9727083	9727083

Mixed catalysts doped, some metal oxides were put also used. The cathodic polarization curves for oxygen reduction on various catalytic electrodes were measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). A Zn-air battery was made with various catalysts for oxygen reduction, and the performance of the battery was measured with a BS-9300SM rechargeable battery charge/discharge device. The results showed that the perovskite type catalyst (La0.6Ca0.4CoO3) doped with metal oxide is an excellent catalyst for the zinc-air battery, and can effectively stimulate the reduction of oxygen and improve the properties of zinc-air batteries, such as discharge capacity, etc. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Although hydrogen production occurs at high columbic efficiency, it causes a localized pH change. It leads to a higher cell voltage and solid deposition as significant challenges of seawater electrolysis. In this regard, the anolyte feed after oxygen evolution to the cathode compartment for hydrogen production is examined. The study aims to prevent the occurrence of a large pH difference on the cathode and anode in the electrolysis of a neutral solution if sufficient OH- ions are permeated through the membrane. The cell performance is evaluated with an anion exchange membrane for separation of the anode and cathode compartments. An inexpensive and efficient molybdenum-oxo catalyst with a turn-over frequency of 1200 is examined for the hydrogen evolving reaction. The flow rate and current density are parametrically studied to determine the effects on both bulk and surface precipitate formation. The effect of electrolyte circulation on the amount of precipitation is predicted based on a mass transfer approach. The mixing electrolyte volume and electrolyte flow rate are found to be significant parameters as they affect cathodic precipitation. Copyright (C) 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

It is shown that intrinsic activities of both reactions decrease with the increasing catalyst loadings, and a more significant decreasing trend was observed in glycine electrooxidation when compared to benzyl alcohol electrooxidation. These phenomena may be explained by an increasing of mass loading induced a decrease of the catalyst surface conductivity, structure changes of Ni(OH)(2) from alpha-phase to beta-phase, and the intercalation of glycine molecules into nickel hydroxide interlayers.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2073-4344		WOS:000516825000119

The first step of photosynthesis consists of the absorption of solar energy by pigments binding protein complexes named photosystems. Within photosystems, a family of proteins called Light Harvesting Complexes (LHC), responsible for light harvesting and energy transfer to reaction centers, has evolved along with eukaryotic organisms. Besides light absorption, these proteins catalyze photoprotective reactions which allowed functioning of oxygenic photosynthetic machinery in the increasingly oxidant environment. In this work we review current knowledge of LHC proteins serving Photosystem II. Balance between light harvesting and photoprotection is critical in Photosystem II, due to the lower quantum efficiency as compared to Photosystem I. In particular, we focus on the role of each antenna complex in light harvesting, energy transfer, scavenging of reactive oxygen species, chlorophyll triplet quenching and thermal dissipation of excess energy.

Understanding the underlying mechanism for irradiation-induced phenomena is of both scientific and technical importance. Here, CdS nanoribbons are used as a model system to study structural and chemical evolution under electron-beam irradiation by in situ transmission electron microscopy. Real-time imaging clearly shows that upon irradiation, CdS is transformed to CdO with the formation of orientation-dependent relationships at surface. The structural transition can always be triggered with a dose rate beyond 601 e/angstrom(2)s in this system. A lower dose rate instead leads to the deposition of an amorphous carbon layer on the surface. Based on real-time observations and density functional theory calculations, a mechanism for the oxidation of CdS to CdO is proposed. It is essentially a thermodynamically driven process that is mediated by the formation of sulfur vacancies due to the electron-beam irradiation. It is also demonstrated that the surface oxidation can be suppressed by pre-depositing a conductive carbon layer on the CdS surface. The carbon coating can effectively reduce the rate of sulfur vacancy creation, thus decreasing defect-mediated oxidation. In addition, it isolates the active oxygen radicals from the ribbon, blocking the pathway for oxygen diffusion.									8	2	0	0	2	0	8			2196-7350			WOS:000396444200020

J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 9149) is generalized here for the case of multisite-occupancy adsorption. Theoretical kinetic isotherms are developed for the systems with quasi-Gaussian distribution of adsorption energies and when all of the segments (mers) of the adsorbing molecule are identical. The two extreme cases of surface topography, that is, patchwise and random topography, are considered. The obtained theoretical equations are used to correlate successfully experimental data for kinetics of oxygen adsorption on polycrystalline tungsten. Six experimental isotherms, measured at different pressures, can be successfully fitted by appropriate choice of only three parameters. The analysis of the estimated best-fit parameters makes drawing certain conclusions possible, concerning the energetic topography of the polycrystalline tungsten surface.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1520-6106			WOS:000177354000018

Using this method, reasonable agreement is achieved with computed cell width and the available experimental data. Elevated initial pressures significantly reduce cell width for a wide range of equivalence ratios, yielding 80% reduction at stoichiometric conditions for a tenfold increase in pressure. Elevated initial temperatures have almost no effect on the cell width at stoichiometric conditions, but yield 80% reduction at lean conditions when the initial temperature is doubled. Reduced nitrogen dilution within the oxidizer dramatically reduces the cell width for the entire computed range of equivalence ratios. Introducing hydrogen as a fuel additive yields mild improvement to detonation sensitivity at stoichiometric conditions, but requires relatively high H-2 concentrations and is ineffective when coupled with elevated initial pressures. Introduction of supplemental oxygen and increasing the initial reactant pressure appears to be the most effective approach to enhance detonability for ethylene-oxidizer mixtures. (C) 2016 IM.

Herein, we first report that constructing a 0D/0D type-II(T-II)/T-II heterojunction is an effective strategy to ingeniously achieve long-range charge separation by taking a ternary heterojunction of TiO2 and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a proof-of-concept. Incorporating g-C3N4 quantum dots (QCN), as the third component, into the commercial P25 composed of anatase (a-TiO2) and rutile (r-TiO2) can be realized via simply mixing the commercially available Degussa P25 and QCN solution followed by heat treatment. The strong coupling and matching band structures among a-TiO2, r-TiO2 and QCN result in the construction of novel T-II/T-II heterojunctions, which would promote the spatial separation and transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, QCN plays a key role in reinforcing light absorption. Particularly, the unique 0D/0D architecture possesses the advantages of abundant active sites for the photocatalytic reaction. As a result, the optimized QCN/a-TiO2/r-TiO2 heterojunctions exhibit enhanced photocatalytic H-2 and O-2 evolution, especially the hydrogen evolution rate (49.3 mu mol h(-1)) is 11.7 times that of bare P25 under visible light irradiation, and sufficient catalytic stability as evidenced by the recycling experiments. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the energy level alignment at interfaces, the dimensionality and component of the heterojunctions. This work provides a stepping stone towards the design of novel heterojunctions for photocatalytic water splitting.									53	3	0	0	0	0	55			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000520487300028	32129406

Changes in the C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio and the carbon abundances were investigated in stars from 3500-4900 K in the galactic globular clusters M71, M5, M3 and M13, covering the metallicity range from 0.7 to 1.6. We found relatively low carbon abundances that are not affected by the value of oxygen abundance. For most giants, the (CC)-C-12-C-13 ratios determined are consistent with the equilibrium value for the CN cycle. This suggests complete mixing on the ascent of the red giant branch, in contrast to the substantially higher values predicted across this range of parameters by the current generation of models. We found some evidence for a larger dispersion of C-12/C-13 in giants of M71 of metallicity [mu] = [M/H] = 0.7 in comparison with the giants of M3, M5 and M13, which are more metal deficient. Finally, we show evidence for lower C-12/C-13 in giants of globular clusters with lower metallicities, as predicted by theory.									25	0	0	0	0	0	25			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000185735600026

The facile achievement of a practical Li-O-2 battery has been proven unrealistic, however. The most significant barrier to progress is the limited understanding of the reaction processes occurring in the battery, especially during the charging process on the positive electrode. Thus, understanding the charging mechanism is of crucial importance to enhance the Li-O-2 battery performance and lifetime. Here, recent progress in understanding the electrochemistry and chemistry related to charging in Li-O-2 batteries is reviewed along with the strategies to address the issues that exist in the charging process at the present stage. The properties of Li2O2 and the mechanisms of Li2O2 oxidation to O-2 on charge are discussed comprehensively, as are the accompanied parasitic chemistries, which are considered as the underlying issues hindering the reversibility of Li-O-2 batteries. Based on the detailed discussion of the charging mechanism, innovative strategies for addressing the issues for the charging process are discussed in detail. This review has profound implications for both a better understanding of charging chemistry and the development of reliable rechargeable Li-O-2 batteries in the future.									175	9	0	0	5	0	176			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000468033400001	30767276

Herein, defect-enriched hollow porous Co-N-doped carbon nanomaterials (Co-N/PCNs) towards ORR were obtained by pyrolyzing a ZIF-8 encapsulated Co ions nanocomposite. We found that the amount of the incorpo-ration of cobalt (II) into ZIF-8 precursors play very important role in the structural evolution of ZIF-8 derivatives during the high temperature pyrolysis. The experiments show that defect-enriched hollow porous Co-N-doped carbon derived from the incorporation of 2 wt% cobalt (II) into ZIF-8 precursors (Co-N/PCNs-2) showed excellent stability and activity towards ORR. The onset potential (E-onset) and the half-wave potential (E-1/2) on Co-N/PCNs-2 are 0.99 V and 0.88 V, respectively, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (E-onset = 0.98 V, E-1/2 = 0.85 V). Moreover, the Zn-air batteries with Co-N/PCNs-2 as an air electrode displays robust stability and high activity, affording a maximum power density of 135 mW cm(-2) in comparison with the Pt/C catalysts (114 mW cm(2)). The density functional theory (DFT) verified that the Co-N-X active site along with the defects are conducive to the O-2 adsorption and thus improve the ORR process compared with the pure Co-N-X active site.

Results of DLTS and high-resolution Laplace DLTS measurements of defects induced in n-type Ge and dilute Ge-rich SiGe by irradiations with 1-6 MeV electrons are presented in this work. The ensuing defect reactions that occur during annealing are discussed. This is compared with damage induced by 1-3 MeV Si or Ge ion implantations into Ge and SiGe at low and high doses and its subsequent removal by furnace annealing.After electron irradiation a sequence of point defects was generated, the detailed spectrum of which depended on the impurity content of the material. In oxygen lean Ge the DLTS spectrum was dominated by the E-center (vacancy group-V-impurity atom pair). In oxygen-rich material the V-O pair was the center present in the greatest concentration. The annealing kinetics of the observed centers are reported. The situation in ion-implanted material is more complex. It is often not possible to measure the as-implanted material with DLTS due to carrier removal and, in some cases, type conversion. DLTS spectra of the high-dose-implanted samples after annealing show evidence of broader features characteristic of defect clusters. The evolution of these defects with annealing is discussed in the context of known defect reactions. Because diffusion of dopant species in Ge is thought to be vacancy mediated the focus of this analysis is on vacancy-related clusters. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most currently designed Z-scheme systems are usually based on precious metal cocatalyst modified semiconductor photocatalysts, thus exploiting noble-metal-free cocatalysts to replace precious metals is of huge interest. Herein, a noble-metal-free Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system was constructed by using MoS2/CdS as the H-2 evolution photocatalyst, Co3O4/BiVO4 as the oxygen evolution photocatalyst and a [Co(bpy)(3)](3+)/[Co(bpy)(3)](2+) redox couple as an electron mediator under visible light irradiation. It is found that the H-2 and O-2 evolution rates are approximate to an ideal ratio of 2 : 1, and the highest H-2 and O-2 evolution rates under visible light irradiation (lambda > 420 nm) are found to be 14.5 and 7.1 mu mol h(-1), respectively, with an excellent stability exceeding 12 h. The apparent quantum yield reaches up to 1.04% at wavelength lambda = 420 nm even without any noble metal. The excellent stability and efficiency of this designed Z-scheme system in neutral water demonstrate its potential use for solar hydrogen generation. This work provides a noble-metal-free approach to construct the Z-scheme photocatalytic overall water splitting system.									79	5	0	0	6	0	79			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000413189100015

These enzymes promote energy conservation coupling the catalytic reaction to charge separation and charge translocation across the prokaryotic cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial membrane. In this way they contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the transmembrane difference of electrochemical potential, which is vital for solute/nutrient cell import, synthesis of ATP and motility. The HCO enzymes most probably share with the nitric oxide reductases. NORs, a common ancestor. We have proposed the classification of HCOs into three different types, A, B and C; based on the constituents of their proton channels (Pereira. Santana and Teixeira (2001) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1505, 185-208). This classification was recently challenged by the suggestion of other different types of HCOs. Using an enlarged sampling we performed an exhaustive bioinformatic reanalysis of HCOs family. Our results strengthened our previously proposed classification and showed no need for the existence of more divisions. Now, we analyze the taxonomic distribution of HCOs and NORs and the congruence of their sequence trees with the 16S rRNA tree. We observed that HCOs are widely distributed in the two prokaryotic domains and that the different types of enzymes are not confined to a specific taxonomic group or environmental niche.

Pristine carbon nanostructures are relatively inert and modifications like nitrogen doping are known for their beneficial effects on the electrochemical activity of carbon nanomaterials in both alkaline and acidic media. However, the long-term stability of these materials, especially in an acidic environment, is rarely mentioned. Here, we evaluate the stability and long-term degradation of nitrogen doped graphene flakes as an oxygen reduction electrocatalyst with theoretical and experimental techniques. We assume that nitrogen dopants in the graphene sheet interact with e(-) and H+ at the electrode-electrolyte interface, leading to NH3 scission and continuous catalyst deactivation. With Density Functional Theory calculations, NH3 scission pathways of pyridinic, graphitic and pyrrolic nitrogen species were analyzed and compared under different operating conditions which are relevant for low and intermediate temperature fuel cells. The computational results are correlated with electrochemical measurements in solid acid fuel cells in a humidified oxygen environment at 240 degrees C.									25	0	0	0	0	0	26			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000429530400053	29589847	
J	Martin, Sebastien; Maury, Bertrand					Maury, Bertrand/0000-0001-5474-4134			MODELING OF THE OXYGEN TRANSFER IN THE RESPIRATORY PROCESS								ESAIM-MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AND NUMERICAL ANALYSIS-MODELISATION MATHEMATIQUE ET ANALYSE NUMERIQUE				47	4			935	960		10.1051/m2an/2012052				JUL 2013	2013	In this article, we propose an integrated model for oxygen transfer into the blood, coupled with a lumped mechanical model for the ventilation process. Objectives. We aim at investigating oxygen transfer into the blood at rest or exercise. The first task consists in describing nonlinear effects of the oxygen transfer under normal conditions. We also include the possible diffusion limitation in oxygen transfer observed in extreme regimes involving parameters such as alveolar and venous blood oxygen partial pressures, capillary volume, diffusing capacity of the membrane, oxygen binding by hemoglobin and transit time of the red blood cells in the capillaries. The second task consists in discussing the oxygen concentration heterogeneity along the path length in the acinus. Method. A lumped mechanical model is considered: a double-balloon model is built upon physiological properties such as resistance of the branches connecting alveoli to the outside air, and elastic properties of the surrounding medium. Then, we focus on oxygen transfer: while the classical [F.J. Roughton and R.E. Forster, J. Appl. Physiol. 11 (1957) 290-302]. approach accounts for the reaction rate with hemoglobin by means of an extra resistance between alveolar air and blood, we propose an alternate description. Under normal conditions, the Hill's saturation curve simply quantifies the net oxygen transfer during the time that venous blood stays in the close neighborhood of alveoli (transit time). Under degraded and/or exercise conditions (impaired alveolar-capillary membrane, reduced transit time, high altitude) diffusion limitation of oxygen transfer is accounted for by means of the nonlinear equation representing the evolution of oxygen partial pressure in the plasma during the transit time. Finally, a one-dimensional model is proposed to investigate the effects of longitudinal heterogeneity of oxygen concentration in the respiratory tract during the ventilation cycle, including previous considerations on oxygen transfer. Results. This integrated approach allows us to recover the right orders of magnitudes in terms of oxygen transfer, at rest or exercise, by using well-documented data, without any parameter tuning or curve fitting procedure. The diffusing capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane does not affect the oxygen transfer rate in the normal regime but, as it decreases (e.g. because of emphysema) below a critical value, it becomes a significant parameter. The one-dimensional model allows to investigate the screening phenomenon, i.e. the possibility that oxygen transfer might be significantly affected by the fact that the exchange area in the peripheral acinus poorly participates to oxygen transfer at rest, thereby providing a natural reserve of transfer capacity for exercise condition. We do not recover this effect: in particular we show that, at rest, although the oxygen concentration is slightly smaller in terminal alveoli, transfer mainly occurs in the acinar periphery.									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0764-583X	1290-3841		WOS:000321571400002		
J	Matsukawa, Takeshi; Ishigaki, Toru								Effect of isothermal holding time on hydrogen-induced structural transitions of WO3								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				50	22			7590	7596		10.1039/d1dt01259b		MAY 2021		JUN 14 2021	2021	Tungsten trioxide (WO3) has the ability to transform oxygen-deficient structures (WO3-x; 0 <= x <= 1) at high temperatures under hydrogen. Because the band gap of WO3-x depends on the amount of W5+ species resulting from oxygen vacancies, this material is expected to have unique applications. Herein, to elucidate the WO3 reduction mechanism, we investigated the crystallographic changes of monoclinic WO3 powder samples using X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements under different reduction conditions, namely, under hydrogen at 500 or 800 degrees C for isothermal holding times of 30 min or 22 h. During heating, the yellow color of WO3 changed to various other colors, suggesting that WO3 underwent different reactions with hydrogen depending on the temperature and isothermal holding time. The X-ray powder diffraction results indicated that the hydrogen-treated WO3 crystals formed various oxygen-deficient structures, including stoichiometric WO3-x, non-stoichiometric WO3-x, and W metal. However, the formation of a single WO3-x phase was extremely difficult. For the blue WO3 sample obtained at short isothermal holding times, the total scattering analysis suggested that the oxygen vacancies in WO3 gradually formed at local positions. Furthermore, the neutron powder diffraction measurements revealed that the reduction of WO3 under hydrogen occurred on the surface. These results obtained by diffraction measurements enhance the knowledge in the chemical and physical properties of WO3-x.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000650321600001	33988207

These range from the most active, glutamate, with near wild-type rates of oxygen evolution to the totally inactive serine and alanine. Photosystem II core complexes lacking the tetranuclear Mn cluster responsible for water oxidation and isolated from wild-type and D1-Asp170Ser, were compared with respect to the kinetics of reduction by Mn2+ of the photooxidized redox-active tyrosine, Z+. The dependence of the rate of reduction of Z+ on the Mn2+ concentration shows mixed first and second-order behavior in the case of the wild-type and second-order behavior alone in the case of the mutant. The second-order rate constants for the wild-type and mutant complexes were 3.1.10(7) M-1 s-1 and 5.5.10(5) M-1 s-1, respectively. The ratio of these rate constants is consistent with the K(m) values determined earlier for the blockage of charge recombination by Mn2+. D1-Aspartate 170 is therefore implicated in a facilitated pathway for the oxidation of Mn2+, which most likely includes participation in a high-affinity metal binding site (Mn2+ and/or Mn3+) in the Photosystem II reaction center.					7TH EUROPEAN BIOENERGETICS CONF ( EBEC )7TH EUROPEAN BIOENERGETICS CONF ( EBEC )	JUL, 1992JUL, 1992		HELSINKI, FINLANDHELSINKI, FINLAND	54	0	0	0	45	0	54			0006-3002			WOS:A1992JE88400003

The resulted Bi2GdO4Cl (F-BG) nanosheets showed the highest photocatalytic activity for oxygen (O-2) evolution and trypan blue (TB) degradation than Bi2NdO4Cl (F-BN), Bi2GdO4Cl (S-BG) and Bi2NdO4Cl (S-BN) synthesized by a solid-state method. The F-BG nanosheets showed the larger specific surface areas and abundant pores, which could provide more reactive sites. The photoelectrochemical and photoluminescence (PL) results revealed that F-BG sample had the excellent separation and transfer rates of photogenerated charge carriers, leading to the highly photocatalytic performance for both O-2 evolution and TB degradation. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed all samples had the visible-light-responsive characteristic. The radical trapping experiment revealed hole (h(+)) played a major role, while superoxide radical (center dot O-2(-)) contributed a little to photocatalytic degradation process. Thus, a possible photocatalytic mechanism was proposed based on the radical trapping experiment. This work shows us a useful insight into the preparation of highly active bismuth-based oxyhalide nanosheets photocatalysts by a molten salt synthesis through surface modification and morphology control and provides the possibility of water splitting under visible light.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000737750100040

Accelerated lifetime testing showed that the best-accelerated service life could be measured only in Mn (3 mol%)/Re and Mn (4 mol%)/Re compared with other prepared Mn (0%,1%, and 2%)/Re electrodes under the condition of 500 mAcm(-2) current density in this study. The modified electrodes were then characterized, including oxygen evolution potential (OEP), crystal structure, and surface composition of the electrode coatings.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000537130600002

Diblock copolymer (PS-b-PEO) micelles are used as templates to assist in the fast complexation of molybdate (MoO42-) and poly-dopamine (PDA) precursors to make hollow precursor MoO42-/PDA/PS-b-PEO particles. Then these particles are carbonized to generate mesoporous N-doped carbon nanosheets riddled with ultrafine molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) nanoparticles (MMo2C/NCS). An N-doped carbon matrix serves as an electron conductor and helps to prevent the aggregation of the Mo2C nanoparticles. The Mo2C nanoparticles in turn enhance the catalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The unique mesoporous 2D nanosheet and its derived 3D hollow structure expose numerous active catalytic sites while enabling free diffusion of the electrolyte and mass transfer. Based on these properties, MMo2C/NCS show enhanced catalytic activity for the ORR.									143	5	0	0	4	0	144			2051-6347	2051-6355		WOS:000413945100022		
J	MCSWEEN, HY; LABOTKA, TC								OXIDATION DURING METAMORPHISM OF THE ORDINARY CHONDRITES								GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA				57	5			1105	1114		10.1016/0016-7037(93)90044-W				MAR 1993	1993	Subtle but progressive changes in the compositions and relative abundances of olivine, pyroxene, and metal with increasing metamorphic grade in equilibrated (types 4-6) ordinary chondrites indicate that these meteorites experienced oxidation of metallic Fe during heating. Oxygen fugacities calculated from these mineral assemblages increase with petrologic type. The hypothesis of oxidation during chondrite metamorphism differs from a commonly accepted idea that chondritic Fe was reduced by graphite. The mineralogies of unequilibrated (type 3) chondrites do not conform to the progressions in equilibrated chondrites, allowing the possibility that Fe may first have been reduced through reaction with graphite at the onset of metamorphism, although there are conflicting observations supporting both oxidation and reduction in these meteorites. As temperatures increased to levels appropriate for types 4-6 chondrites, the activity of graphite may have been lowered by its dissolution in taenite; and, in any case, oxygen fugacities appear to have been well within the stability field of graphite, precluding its reaction. At these temperatures oxidation state was largely controlled by equilibrium between ferromagnesian silicates and metal. Oxygen fugacities calculated from chondrite mineral equilibria are 2-3 log units below previously reported intrinsic f(O2) measurements. We propose that progressive oxidation during metamorphism was promoted by interaction with small amounts of an oxidizing vapor, derived by heating ices originally accreted into the parent asteroids. Assuming that this vapor was pure H2O, the water:rock weight ratio required to account for the observed oxidation of Fe in H and L chondrites is very modest, less than several per mil. Progressive oxidation in the metamorphic sequence resulted from different degrees of reaction with such a fluid, possibly caused by temperature variations or evolution of the composition of the fluid as it permeated through the body. The presence of even minor amounts of a vapor phase during metamorphism affects interpretations of the volatile trace-element and oxygen isotopic fractionations observed in ordinary chondrites and inferred to have formed by nebular or parent-body processes.									83	1	0	0	4	0	84			0016-7037			WOS:A1993KR47300013

Pristine MoS(2)exhibits poor alkaline HER activity due to weak water adsorption and dissociation. Precisely manipulating active water dissociation components to form a functional interface with MoS(2)would be an effective strategy. Herein, in-plane intergrowth CoS2/MoS(2)ultrathin nanosheets have been achievedviaa one-step pyrolytic sulfurization of a small-sized Co/Mo-MOF precursor. The in-plane intergrowth structure produced abundant interfaces and modulated the interfacial electronic structure, demonstrating an accelerated water dissociation process. Ultralow overpotentials at both onset (16 mV) and 10 mA cm(-2)(75 mV) have been obtained, which surpass those of most top-rated MoS2-based materials and are even proximate to those of commercial Pt/C (0 mV at onset and 60 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively). Under a large current density of 400 mA cm(-2), the intergrowth nanosheet exhibited long-term stability, showing potential for applications in alkaline water splitting devices.									31	1	0	0	2	0	32			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000541615200033

However, its industrial application is impeded by unsatisfactory energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a robust electrode composed of porous nickel foam (PNF) and Fe-doped Ni3S2 (Fe-Ni3S2) nanosheet arrays was fabricated and applied for industrial AWE. By conducting a scalable dynamic bubble-template method, PNF with high loading of active catalysts was prepared. The superhydrophilicity of PNF facilitates bubble detachment and promotes mass transfer, especially at high current densities. In addition, Fe-Ni3S2 with optimized electronic structure is featured with enhanced electrical conductivity, sufficient exposure of active sites, and optimized adsorption of intermediates. Benefiting from the concerted advantages of PNF and Fe-Ni3S2, the obtained Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5 electrode with an optimal Fe content of 5 mol% exhibits high catalytic activity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Compared with the Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF couple, the Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5||Fe-Ni3S2/PNF-5 couple delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.50 V for AWE. Under industrial conditions, a competitive cell voltage of 1.75 V is needed for achieving a high current density of 400 mA cm(-2). Besides, the couple can operate stably for 120 h, outperforming the commercial RN||RN couple. This work provides a novel strategy to elevate the loading amount of catalysts and improve the electrochemical performance of the electrode for practical AWE application.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

The X-ray powder diffraction data showed that the SmFe(0.5)Cr(0.5)O(3)perovskite crystallizes in an orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure, while the homogeneity of the sample was affirmed basing on scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The infrared spectra highlighted a set of absorption peaks corresponding to the stretching and bending vibrations of bands binding respectively iron and chromium with oxygen. Dielectric properties of SmFe0.5Cr0.5O3 were investigated in a wide frequency and temperature range. The evolution of epsilon' and tan(delta) with frequency illustrated the relaxation phenomenon, while their evolution as a function of temperature revealed a ferroelectric-paraelectric transition occurring in the material. It was also observed that the compound becomes conductor at high temperatures (T > 620K). The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity was also discussed and the activation energies were calculated. The fitted impedance spectroscopy data revealed that both grains and grain boundaries contribute in the electric conductivity of the SmFe(0.5)Cr(0.5)O(3)perovskite (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of pH, oxygen, and H2O2 on the photocatalytic degradation of these compounds has been established. The three organics were analyzed by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and their mineralization by total organic concentration (TOC) measurements. The evolution of the toxicity to Lemna minor of the aqueous solutions of the three organics during their photocatalytic treatment has also been studied. The obtained results have been interpreted according to Fourier transform infrared studies on the interaction of the molecules with the catalyst surface and their reaction mechanisms by gas chromatographpy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. The toxicity studies have shown that some intermediates acted as nutrients or toxicity antagonists as negative growth rate inhibitions were obtained. After 30 min of reaction, the resorcinol and pyrimethanil solutions were detoxified, although some amount of the organics still remained. In the case of triadimenol, a 92% detoxification was achieved after 60 min of reaction. The solar photocatalytic degradations of the pollutants have resulted to be comparable with those obtained with UV lamp. The obtained results suggest that the type of interaction of pyrimethanil and triadimenol with the TiO2 surface decides their degradation mechanism by which the effect of pH, H2O2, and dissolved oxygen is determined. It has also been confirmed that the photocatalytic techniques are very efficient at the detoxification of wastewaters contaminated with these fungicides.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0199-6231	1528-8986		WOS:000259805200002

So far, their edges, dopant heteroatoms and defects have been intensively explored as active sites for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) to split water. However, grain boundaries (GBs), a key type of defects in TMDs, have been overlooked due to their low density and large structural variations. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of wafer-size atom-thin TMD films with an ultra-high-density of GBs, up to similar to 10(12) cm(-2). We propose a climb and drive 0D/2D interaction to explain the underlying growth mechanism. The electrocatalytic activity of the nanograin film is comprehensively examined by micro-electrochemical measurements, showing an excellent hydrogen-evolution performance (onset potential: -25 mV and Tafel slope: 54 mV dec(-1)), thus indicating an intrinsically high activation of the TMD GBs.									90	12	0	0	5	0	89			2041-1723			WOS:000551398300001	31896753

Here, we performed the first systematic studies of lysine succinylation in cyanobacteria, which are the only prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis and the established model organisms for studying photosynthetic mechanisms. By using mass spectrometry analysis in combination with the enrichment of succinylated peptides from digested cell lysates, we identified 1,704 lysine succinylation sites on 691 proteins in a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that a large proportion of the succinylation sites were present on proteins in photosynthesis and metabolism. Among all identified succinylated proteins involved in photosynthesis, the PSII manganese-stabilizing protein (PsbO) was found to be succinylated on Lys99 and Lys234. Functional studies of PsbO were performed by site-directed mutagenesis, and mutants mimicking either constitutively succinylated (K99E and K234E) or non-succinylated states (K99R and K234R) were constructed. The succinylation-mimicking K234E mutant exhibited a decreased oxygen evolution rate of the PSII center and the efficiency of energy transfer during the photosynthetic reaction. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested a mechanism that may allow succinylation to influence the efficiency of photosynthesis by altering the conformation of PsbO, thereby hindering the interaction between PsbO and the PSII core. Our findings suggest that reversible succinylation may be an important regulatory mechanism during photosynthesis in Synechococcus, as well as in other photosynthetic organisms.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0032-0781	1471-9053		WOS:000438295800019	29912468

Yet, the nature of the catalytically active sites remains unclear. Herein, density functional theory calculations are applied to systematically assess the stability of low-Miller-index facets of beta-Mo2C as a function of carbon chemical potential (mu C) and surface-carbon coverage (nC). When reconstruction of surface carbon is considered to characterize beta-Mo2C under varying environments, the (111) and (101) surfaces are predicted to be most stable, dominating the Wulff particle surface area across a broad range of mu C. The surface-carbon coverage is predicted to steadily increase for all low-index facets under more carburizing reaction conditions, leading to distinct effects on the adsorption energetics for atomic hydrogen and oxygen. Whereas H binding is only slightly affected by surface carbon, O is systematically destabilized. The findings reported indicate that consideration of only bulk-terminated surfaces, and the common focus of theoretical studies on the bulk-truncated, close-packed (100) surface, is likely insufficient to capture the reactivity of the working beta-Mo2C catalyst. Similar to metal oxides, beta-Mo2C catalysts are predicted to be dynamic materials with surface compositions and reactivities that evolve in response to the environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000797914700003

This is important for process optimisation and control in deposition of wear and corrosion resistant PEO coatings, which currently attract significant interest. The oxidation was performed under galvanostatic conditions in the range of current densities from 400 to 1500 A m(-2), with concentration of aqueous alkaline electrolyte varied from 0.5 to 2 g l(-1) KOH. Electrolyte pH was evaluated before and after each PEO treatment. The volume of anodic gas evolved during the process was also measured, with the composition of the gaseous products being subsequently analysed using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. It was proposed that, within the studied ranges of experimental parameters, the evolution excessive oxygen is primarily caused by peroxide decomposition due to the interaction with both hydroxyl ions and radicals at the discharge-electrolyte interface. The interaction with the ions also results in electrolyte acidification, although this process is likely to be contributed by water decomposition due to the ion bombardment from discharge.

We conducted the two-step synthesis of cobalt oxide/N-doped graphene nanohybrids (CNG) with solvents of water, ethanol, and dimethylformamide (DMF), representing tree typical categories of aqueous, polar organic, and organic N-containing solvents commonly adopted for graphene nanocomposites preparation. The superior ORR performance of the DMF-hybrids can be attributed to the high nitrogen-doping, aggregation-free hybridization, and unique graphene porous structures. As DMF is the more effective N-source, the spectroscopic results support a catalytic nitrogenation potentially mediated by cobalt-DMF coordination complexes. The wide-distribution of porosity (covering micro-, meso-, to macro-pore) and micron-void assembly of graphene may further enhance the diffusion kinetics for ORR. As the results, CNG by DMF-synthesis exhibits the high ORR activities close to Pt/C (i.e. only 8 mV difference of half-wave potential with electron transfer number of 3.96) with the better durability in the alkaline condition. Additional graphene hybrids comprised of iron and manganese oxides also show the superior ORR activities by DMF-synthesis, confirming the general solvent-dependent protocol to achieve enhanced ORR activities.									19	0	0	0	3	0	19			2045-2322			WOS:000388232900001	27853187

Little is known about how these rates vary and covary in regional groundwater settings, as few studies have focused on regional datasets with multiple tracers and methods of analysis that account for effects of mixed residence times on apparent reaction rates. This study provides insight into the characteristics of residence times and rates of O-2 reduction and denitrification (NO3- reduction) by comparing reaction rates using multi-model analytical residence time distributions (RTDs) applied to a data set of atmospheric tracers of groundwater age and geochemical data from 141 well samples in the Central Eastern San Joaquin Valley, CA. The RTD approach accounts for mixtures of residence times in a single sample to provide estimates of in-situ rates. Tracers included SF6, CFCs, H-3, He from H-3 (tritiogenic He), C-14, and terrigenic He. Parameter estimation and multi-model averaging were used to establish RTDs with lower error variances than those produced by individual RTD models. The set of multi model RTDs was used in combination with NO3- and dissolved gas data to estimate zero order and first order rates of O-2 reduction and denitrification. Results indicated that O-2 reduction and denitrification rates followed approximately log-normal distributions. Rates of O-2 and NO3- reduction were correlated and, on an electron milliequivalent basis, denitrification rates tended to exceed O-2 reduction rates. Estimated historical NO3- trends were similar to historical measurements. Results show that the multi model approach can improve estimation of age distributions, and that relatively easily measured O-2 rates can provide information about trends in denitrification rates, which are more difficult to estimate.

J	Laisk, Agu; Oja, Vello								Variable fluorescence of closed photochemical reaction centers								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				143	3			335	346		10.1007/s11120-020-00712-3				MAR 2020	2020	Chlorophyll fluorescence induction during 0.4 to 200 ms multiple-turnover pulses (MTP) was measured in parallel with O-2 evolution induced by the MTP light. Additionally, a saturating single-turnover flash (STF) was applied at the end of each MTP and the total MTP +STF O-2 evolution was measured. Quantum yield of O-2 evolution during the MTP transients was calculated and related to the number of open PSII centers, found from the STF O-2 evolution. Proportionality between the number of open PSII and their running photochemical activity showed the quantum yield of open PSII remained constant independent of the closure of adjacent centers. During the induction, total fluorescence was partitioned between F-o of all the open centers and F-c of all the closed centers. The fluorescence yield of a closed center was 0.55 of the final F-m while less than a half of the centers were closed, but later increased, approaching F-m to the end of the induction. In the framework of the antenna/radical pair equilibrium model, the collective rise of the fluorescence of centers closed earlier during the induction is explained by an electric field, facilitating return of excitation energy from the Pheo(-) P680(+) radical pair to the antenna.									10	0	0	0	7	0	10			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000519797900009	31960223

A highly desirable yet great challenge is the preparation of stable Cu-based photocatalysts, and its application in photocatalytic H-2 evolution and photodegradation are desirable to explore. In this study, ultrathin graphene-coated metal Cu nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated through a two-step pyrolysis process using MOFs as precursors and show remarkable stability even in an oxidative atmosphere. Benefiting from the nanostructure, the optimized Cu@C/SrTiO3 shows a photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate of 255.3 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1), and the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) reaches 3.8% at 420 nm. The acetone evolution rate of Cu@C/SrTiO3 is approximately 21-fold higher than that of Cu/STO in photocatalytic isopropyl alcohol (IPA) degradation under visible light. Moreover, the graphene layer demonstrated a quasi-cocatalyst effect. Time-resolved photoluminescence and theoretical calculations reveal that the ultrathin graphene layer promotes charge separation and induces electron density redistribution over Cu@C, which distinctly boosts H-2 evolution. This work provides an effective method to protect Cu NPs and a broader prospect for exploring non-precious Cu-based nanocomposites in photocatalytic conversion.									35	2	0	0	5	0	35			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000522640100139

Mesoporous carbon was oxidized in concentrated nitric acid at 26 degrees C, 50 degrees C, 70 degrees C, and 100 degrees C. The evolution of mesopores and surface oxygen-containing functional groups (SOFGs) of the mesoporous carbons were studied by nitrogen cryosorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thenno-gravimetric analysis. The results demonstrate that the specific surface area and the mesopore volume decrease, while the SOFGs accumulate with increasing oxidation temperature. The supercapacitor performance Was characterized in a KOH aqueous electrolyte. An enhanced energy density with a highest value of 5.7Wh/kg is obtained after oxidation at 100 degrees C compared to 3.5Wh/kg before oxidation, demonstrating the possibility of using modified mesoporous carbons in high energy density applications. The enhanced energy density is attributed to the contribution of SOFGs to charge storage in both the electric double layer and the Faradic reaction. The power density is also improved with a highest value of 3 125 W/kg after oxidation at 76 degrees C compared to the original value of 2 015 W/kg. The improvement of power density relies on the improved wettability of carbon surfaces, which can facilitate the ion transport.									92	17	0	0	3	0	94			1007-8827	1872-5805		WOS:000252044000004

The resulting Fe1-xS/N, S-MGCS catalysts demonstrate excellent electrocatalytic activities towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline and acidic media, the activities of which are closely related to the content and distribution of iron sulfide species. The most optimized electrocatalytic activity achieved over (Fe1-xS/N, S-MGCS)(0.2) even outperforms that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst in alkaline media, and is close to that of highly active non-precious metal catalysts reported so far in acidic media. The remarkable catalytic performance is ascribed to the iron sulfide nanocrystals introduced into the highly conductive carbon supports for significantly enhancing the reactivity of catalytically active sites, and the raisin bread-like structure constructed for improving the characteristics of electron and ion transport and inhibiting the self-aggregation and leaching of iron sulfide species. Moreover, this work inspires a new consideration in the field for understanding the catalytic roles of the doped carbon species and transition metal chalcogenides during the ORR electrocatalysis.									48	4	0	0	4	0	48			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000402734600039

J	Shin, DB; Lee, IS								The fluid evolution related to talc mineralization in the Hwanggangri area, South Korea								RESOURCE GEOLOGY				52	3			273	278		10.1111/j.1751-3928.2002.tb00137.x				2002	2002	Scores of talc deposits distributed in the Hwanggangri Mineralized Zone, South Korea are interpreted to have resulted from the contact metamorphic process related to the igneous intrusion of the Muamsa Granite. Talc usually occurs as an alteration product from tremolite, which is crystallized during the prograde stage. It commonly forms fine-grained, fibrous aggregates, or pseudomorphs after tremolite, and abundant tremolite is included as impurities in the talc ore. Quantitative X-ray diffraction analysis has shown that the ores can be divided into three types depending on the concentrations of talc; talc-tremolite ore (talc > 50 %), tremolite-talc ore (10 % < talc < 50 %), and tremolite (talc < 10 %) ores. Oxygen isotope compositions of those talc ores become higher from 10.9similar to12.1 through 11.6similar to12.3 to 11.9similar to13.2 % with increasing tremolite concentrations, while hydrogen isotope compositions are not so variable, -73 to -69 %. The high value of the calculated delta(18)O(H2O) of the fluids equilibrated with the tremolite may have resulted from the mixing of magmatic water with O-18-enriched CO2 evolved from the decarbonation reaction during the prograde stage. However, as the decarbonation reaction ceased during the retrograde stage, the inferred oxygen isotope compositions of talc-forming fluids show similar values to those of the igneous fluids.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1344-1698			WOS:000178733600008

Prospects for neutrino spin coherence in supernovae								PHYSICAL REVIEW D				95	6					063004	10.1103/PhysRevD.95.063004				MAR 3 2017	2017	We present neutrino bulb model simulations of Majorana neutrino coherent spin transformation (i.e., neutrino-antineutrino transformation), coupled to neutrino flavor evolution, for conditions corresponding to the neutronization burst epoch of an oxygen-neon-magnesium core collapse supernova. Significant neutrino spin transformation in, for example, the neutronization burst could alter the fluences of neutrinos and antineutrinos in a way which is potentially detectable for a Galactic core collapse supernova. Our calculations for the first time incorporate geometric dilution in the spin evolution of the neutrinos and combine two-flavor and three-flavor evolution with spin mixing physics. We find that significant spin transformations can occur, but only with a large neutrino luminosity and an electron fraction (Ye) profile which facilitates adiabatic conditions for the spin-channel resonance. Using our adopted parameters of neutrino energy spectra, luminosity, density and Ye profiles, our calculations require an unrealistically large neutrino rest mass to sustain the spin transformation. It is an open question whether examining different density profiles or incorporating other sources of nonlinear feedback, such as Ye feedback, could mitigate this need. We find that spin transformations are not sensitive to the flavor structure of neutrinos; i.e., the spin transformations occur regardless of whether we simulate two-or three-flavor transformations. In the two-flavor case, spin transformations were insensitive to the choice of solar or atmospheric mass-squared splitting as well as the choice of the Majorana phase. Importantly, our three-flavor simulations, as well as our two-flavor simulations done with the atmospheric mass-squared splitting, show that the inclusion of spin degrees of freedom can significantly and qualitatively alter neutrino flavor evolution.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			2470-0010	2470-0029		WOS:000396031300004

Detailed mineralogical information is essential to understand underground reaction conditions far from the surface and optimize the operation parameters during the UCG process. It is also significant in identifying the environmental effects of UCG residue. In this paper, with regard to the underground gasification of lignite, UCG slag was prepared through simulation tests of oxygen-enriched gasification under different atmospheric conditions, and the minerals were identified by X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope coupled to an energy-dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Thermodynamic calculations performed using FactSage 6.4 were used to help to understand the transformation of minerals. The results indicate that an increased oxygen concentration is beneficial to the reformation of mineral crystal after ash fusion and the resulting crystal structures of minerals also tend to be more orderly. The dominant minerals in 60%-O-2 and 80%-O-2 UCG slag include anorthite, pyroxene, and gehlenite, while amorphous substances almost disappear. In addition, with increasing oxygen content, mullite might react with the calcium oxide existed in the slag to generate anorthite, which could then serve as a calcium source for the formation of gehlenite. In 80%-O-2 UCG slag, the iron-bearing mineral is transformed from sekaninaite to pyroxene.									10	2	0	0	0	0	12			2075-163X			WOS:000380038500004

The strong electronic interactions between PPy and NiCo alloy are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectra. Because these interations can remarkably reduce the apparent activation energy (E-a) for HER and enhance the turnover frequency of catalysts, the electrocatalytic performance of PPy@NiCo hybrid nanotube arrays are significantly improved. The electrochemical tests show that the PPy@NiCo hybrid catalysts exhibit a low overpotential of similar to 186 mV at 10.0 mAcm(-2) and a small tafel slope of 88.6 mVdeg(-1) for HER in the alkaline solution. The PPy@NiCo hybrid nanotubes also exhibit high catalytic activity and high stability for HER.y									10	3	0	0	1	0	10			2095-0179	2095-0187		WOS:000445220700019

The ideal material should be durable, low-cost, efficient and possess high surface area. Earth abundant Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are the potential group of materials for providing inexpensive source of durable HER catalysts with high surface area and active edges due to their layered structure. Here, we report a scalable single-step microwave-assisted solution phase synthesis of NiTe2 with core-shell configuration over porous three-dimensional nickel foam (3D-NF). This surface heterojunction catalyst possesses high surface area, unique needlelike morphology, and efficient performance for hydrogen evolution reactions. NiTe2 needles decorated on porous 3D-NF displayed fast HER kinetics with a reasonable overpotential of similar to -0.36 V to drive a current density of 100 mA cm-2. A small Tafel slope of similar to 55 mV dec(-1) is observed. The catalyst showed higher stability with negligible performance degradation even after 8 h of potential cycling operation. It also demonstrated negligible current density variation at a constant applied potential for more than 15 h in 0.5 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solution. The 3D porous skeleton allowed high impregnation of electrolyte while the dense needlelike morphology provided high surface area and active edge sites for reactions. A thin 7 nm of amorphous oxide overlayer shell on highly crystalline NiTe2 core structure makes it a surface heterojunction catalyst (SHC) which is reported to facilitate hydrogen desorption upon charge take up and makes it an efficient electrocatalyst.

To assess the potential water quality changes that occur during subsurface passage, a comprehensive deep-well injection experiment was carried out for a recharge scheme, where pretreated, aerobic surface water was injected at 300 m depth into an anaerobic aquifer. Water quality parameters were recorded over the 854-days long injection phase. The evolution of the major ion and redox chemistry was analyzed with a three-dimensional reactive multicomponent transport model. It was found that the oxidation of pyrite was the main driver for water quality changes and that reaction rates depended significantly on the spatially/temporally varying groundwater temperature. With the temperature dependency of the oxidation reactions incorporated into the model, the simulations give an accurate picture of the temporal and spatial evolution of the hydrochemical changes that occurred during the experiment. To delineate the influence of physical and chemical processes on local concentration changes the results of the reactive transport model simulations were compared with the corresponding results from nonreactive simulations. The study emphasizes the suitability of mechanistic multicomponent reactive transport modeling as an integrative tool for data analysis when physical transport and chemical processes interact.									113	2	0	0	55	0	116			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000228172600050	15871255

The eternal quest for sustainable energy production strategies has culminated in the electrocatalytic water splitting process integrated with renewable energy resources. The successful accomplishment of this process is thoroughly subject to competent, earth-abundant, and low-cost electrocatalysts to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), preferably, in the same electrolyte. The present contribution has been dedicated to studying the synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical properties of newfangled electrocatalysts with the formal composition of Mg1-xTMxB2 (x=0.025, 0.05, and 0.1; TM (transition metal)=Fe and Co) primarily in HER as well as OER under 1 M KOH medium. The electrochemical tests revealed that among all the metal-doped MgB2 catalysts, Mg0.95Co0.05B2 has the best HER performance showing an overpotential of 470 mV at-10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 80 mV dec(-1) on account of its high purity and fast electron transport. Further investigation shed some light on the fact that Fe concentration and overpotential for HER have adverse relation meaning that the highest amount of Fe doping (x=0.1) displayed the lowest overpotential. This contribution introduces not only highly competent electrocatalysts composed of low-cost precursors for the water-splitting process but also a facile scalable method for the assembly of highly porous electrodes paving the way for further stunning developments in the field.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			2045-2322			WOS:000617647000004	33558628

The phase evolution, morphology and discharge behavior at 500 degrees C were investigated by thermal gravimeter/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA), X-ray diffraction(XRD), scanning electron microscopy(SEM) and specific surface analysis(BET). The mixed vanadium oxides are obtained from the pyrolytic decomposition of ammonium metavanadate, with V6O13 as main phase. Results show that the lithiation reaction begins at about 258 degrees C, with gamma-LiV2O5 and VO2(B) as the product. VO2(B) can transit to VO2(R) in the range of 400-500 degrees C, following by grain growth and crystalline development with the increase of temperature and roasting time. The ratio of gamma-LiV2O5 to VO2 can be modified by the additive content of lithium bromide. A lattice shearing model about the nucleation and growth of LixV2O5 and VO2(B) inside mixed valence (+4, +5) vanadium oxides (e.g. V6O13, V3O7) is speculated, which is relative to oxygen-/vacancy-diffusion and structural evolution inspired by lithium-insertion. The open-circuit voltage of 2.6 V is observed in the single cell of Li-B/LiCl-KCl/(gamma-LiV2O5NO2) at 500 degrees C, and the specific capacities of 146 and 167 mA.h/g (cut-off voltage 1.4 V) are measured for the positive material at 100 mA/cm(2) and 200 mA/cm(2), respectively.									1	2	0	0	0	0	2			1003-6326	2210-3384		WOS:000249574400010

Operating conditions are chosen thanks to results of a preliminary modelling of an industrial EFR. Influence of addition of steam (0.55 g/g db), carbon dioxide (0.87 g/g db) and oxygen (Equivalent Ratio: 0-0.61) is investigated between 800 and 1400 degrees C with beech wood particles sieved between 315 and 450 mu m as feedstock. The model takes into account pyrolysis reaction, gas phase reaction with a detailed chemical scheme (176 species, 5988 reactions), char gasification by steam and CO2 and soot formation. H2O or CO2 addition has no influence on gasification product yields at 800 and 1000 degrees C, while at 1200 and 1400 degrees C the char gasification is significantly enhanced and soot formation is certainly inhibited by OH radical which reacts with soot precursors. The modification of output gas phase composition is mostly due to WGS reaction which reaches thermodynamic equilibrium from about 1200 degrees C. As expected, O-2 has a significant influence on gas and tar yields through combustion reactions. Char and soot yields decrease as ER increases. The GASPAR model allows a good prediction of gas and char and gives relevant evolution of soot and tar yields on the large majority of conditions studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The plasma was sustained with an inductively coupled radiofrequency generator operating at various power levels in either E-mode (up to the forward power of 300 W) or H-mode (above 500 W). The treatments that used H-mode caused nearly instant thermal degradation of the polymer samples. The density of the charged particles in E-mode was on the order of 10(16) m(-3), which prevented material destruction upon plasma treatment, but the density of neutral O-atoms in the ground state was on the order of 10(21) m(-3). The evolution of plasma characteristics during sample treatment in E-mode was determined by optical emission spectroscopy; surface modifications were determined by water adsorption kinetics and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; and etching intensity was determined by residual gas analysis. The results showed moderate surface functionalization with hydroxyl and carboxyl/ester groups, weak etching at a rate of several nm/s, rather slow activation down to a water contact angle of 30 degrees and an ability to rapidly absorb water.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2073-4360			WOS:000375159900047	30979239

The products exhibited remarkable HER performance with small Tafel slope (58.5 mV dec(-1)), low overpotential (169.8 mV) at 10 mA cm(-2), high conductivity and durable stability, which are attribute to the mechanisms (1) 3D hollow framework furnishes large specific surface area, (2) hierarchical structure generates more active sites, (3) like-Pacific Plate architecture facilitates the touch of electrolyte and catalyst, and (4) closely packed arrays expedite the migration of electron. The current work indicates that unique 3D hierarchical hollow sphere arrays with like-Pacific Plate architecture will be a potential candidate for effective electrocatalytic water splitting catalyst material with energy source application.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000482553700001	31370057

High pore volume fraction of 0.71 cm(3) g(-1) and very developed surface area of 468 m(2) g(-1) were evidenced by mercury porosimetry and BET adsorption measurements. The influence of the doping metal on the electrochemical behavior of Ni-GC/electrolyte interface was studied, using Ni-GC both as synthesized and surface doped with platinum, while aqueous 2.5 mM H2SO4 + 1 M Na2SO4 solution served as an electrolyte. Hydrogen and the oxygen evolution was used as test electrode reactions.

After exposition to NO of the Si(111) surface, an oxynitride/silicon interface is formed. The evolution with irradiation time of the oxynitridation of silicon and of the oxynitride/silicon interface formation is examined in situ by means of core-level and valence-band photoemission spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and work-function measurements. The analysis of the valence band and Si 2p, O 2s, and N 2s photoelectron spectra, together with the Auger Si transition, clearly exhibits additional oxynitride formation under USR. The oxygen-to-nitrogen ratio, O/N, from the thin oxynitride layer increased after a long time (> 10 min) of exposure to USR. Hence, USR appears to have the opposite effect to the one produced by thermal activation in which the nitridation is favored.									10	0	0	0	0	0	10			0021-8979			WOS:A1991GC09800075

Human genomics				2	5			329	35						2006-Mar	2006	The NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) gene family belongs to the flavoprotein clan and, in the human genome, consists of two genes (NQO1 and NQO2). These two genes encode cytosolic flavoenzymes that catalyse the beneficial two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. This reaction prevents the unwanted one-electron reduction of quinones by other quinone reductases; one-electron reduction results in the formation of reactive oxygen species, generated by redox cycling of semiquinones in the presence of molecular oxygen. Both the mammalian NQO1 and NQO2 genes are upregulated as a part of the oxidative stress response and are inexplicably overexpressed in particular types of tumours. A non-synonymous mutation in the NQO1 gene, leading to absence of enzyme activity, has been associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukaemia and other types of blood dyscrasia in workers exposed to benzene. NQO2 has a melatonin-binding site, which may explain the anti-oxidant role of melatonin. An ancient NQO3 subfamily exists in eubacteria and the authors suggest that there should be additional divisions of the NQO family to include the NQO4 subfamily in fungi and NQO5 subfamily in archaebacteria. Interestingly, no NQO genes could be identified in the worm, fly, sea squirt or plants; because these taxa carry quinone reductases capable of one- and two-electron reductions, there has been either convergent evolution or redundancy to account for the appearance of these enzyme functions whenever they have been needed during evolution.									122	4	1	0	99	0	128				1479-7364		MEDLINE:16595077	16595077

Herein a simple and feasible ammonia defective activation strategy is explored on ordered mesoporous carbon (APC) to confine hematin precursor and suppress the formation of inorganic Fe-based derivatives during pyrolysis. Thus, a hierarchically nanoporous Fe/N/APC catalyst with high numbers of exposed iron nitrogen sites exhibits an impressive performance for oxygen reduction reaction in alkaline media, with large diffusion-limited current density and positive half-wave potential with respect to commercial Pt/C catalyst. The enhanced ORR properties can be majorly ascribed to synergistic contributions of high numbers of exposed catalytic sites completion from high contents of Fe-N and pyridinic N along with the fast mass-transport properties arising from the etched high permeable porous structure. When applied as cathodic catalyst in Zn-air battery, it demonstrates a power density of 200 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 605 mA h g(Zn)(-1) higher than those of Pt/C catalyst.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			2168-0485			WOS:000419536800058

Nanostructures and carbon-based hybrids are introduced to increase active-site abundance and to promote mass transportation. Herein, we reported a facile strategy for the in situ synthesis of bimetallic alloy-metal carbide heterostructures on ultra-fine chitin derived N-doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs). The chitin nanofibers have abundant functional groups including hydroxyl (-OH) and amino (-NH2), which can strongly catch the metal ions. After the carbonization process, the Mo0.84Ni0.16-Mo2C nanoparticles were in situ formed throughout the whole NCNFs. Owing to the unique 3D nanofibers network structure, large specific surface area and synergistic effects between the Mo0.84Ni0.16 alloy and Mo2C, the Mo0.84Ni0.16-Mo2C/NCNFs electrocatalysts exhibit excellent HER activity with low overpotentials of 183 mV (10 mA cm(-2)) and Tafel slope of 71 mV dec(-1) in alkaline solution. Heterointerface engineering can optimize the chemical configurations of active sites toward intrinsically boosted HER kinetics. The Mo0.84Ni0.16-Mo2C/NCNFs display temperature-dependent HER activity and the 750 degrees C is the best carbonization temperature. In addition, the electrocatalysts exhibit outstanding stability during continuous HER electrolysis. This work provides a simple strategy to fabricate bimetal alloy metal carbide heterostructures.

However, its production is still dependent on the traditional Haber-Bosch process under high temperature and pressure, which has enormous pressure on both the world energy supply and global warming issue. In this work, bismuth molybdate nanosheets rich in oxygen vacancies were created via NaOH treatment of bismuth molybdate nanosheets by a simple, robust and cost-effective process of NaOH etching treatment at room temperature to boost the photocatalytic nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia under visible light illumination at room temperature and ambient pressure. It was found that rich oxygen vacancies largely improved both the photo generated charge carrier separation and N-2 adsorption/activation capabilities of bismuth molybdate nanosheets. Thus, an enhanced, stable photocatalytic N-2 fixation performance with a superior average ammonia production rate of near 800 mu mol.g(-1).h(-1) was achieved under visible light illumination in repeated uses. Even better photocatalytic N-2 fixation performance was observed under simulated solar illumination. The photocatalyst showed good tolerance to oxygen, allowing the use of air rather pure N-2 in the reaction. Thus, it is promising for ammonia production from the photocatalytic N-2 fixation with solar energy by these bismuth molybdate nano sheets with rich oxygen vacancies, which could provide a greener and more sustainable alternative than the traditional Haber-Bosch process.									25	1	0	0	0	0	25			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000600984100004

Ln addition to Ta2C, Ta2O5 also formed as an intermediate product before full conversion to TaC. A thermodynamic analysis showed that such a complex reaction path was followed because the carburizing reactions generate enough CO2 to oxidize the metal. The reaction of tantalum with CO-CO2 gas mixtures was also investigated. The kinetics of reaction is discussed in terms of the reaction mechanisms and the reacting gas composition.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0921-5093			WOS:A1995QW53600016

(a) The kinetics of P680(+) reduction become markedly slower in the presence of 100 mu M CuSO4. (b) The CuSO4-induced kinetics of P680(+) reduction are dominated by a 140-160-mu s decay, (c) The extent of these 140-160-mu s kinetics, normalized to the overall decay, remains virtually unaffected by addition of the exogenous PS II donor, NH2OH. (d) In thoroughly dark-adapted samples the CuSO4-induced 140-160-mu s kinetics are already observed after the first flash and remain unchanged by a train of excitation flashes. (e) The extent of P680(+) and Q(A)(-) formation under repetitive flash excitation is not diminished by addition of 100 mu M CuSO4. (f) The induction of mu s kinetics of P680(+) reduction at the expense of ns kinetics and the inhibition of the saturation rate of oxygen evolution exhibit the same dependence on CuSO4 concentration, (g) CuSO4 also transforms the 10-20-mu s reduction of P680(+) by Tyr(Z) in Tris-washed PS II membrane fragments into 140-160-mu s kinetics without any effect on the extent of flash-induced P680(+) formation. These results unambiguously show that Cu(II) does not affect the charge separation (P680(+)Q(A)(-)), but instead specifically modifies Tyr(Z) and/or its micro environment so that the electron transfer to P680(+) becomes blocked.									49	2	1	0	44	1	52			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:A1994QA63800025	7806512

The discharge ( current pulse duration of 60 ns) has allowed the generation of a transient homogeneous non-equilibrium plasma, and the time evolution of the OH density has been measured ( relative value) in the afterglow ( up to 200 mu s) by laser induced fluorescence ( LIF). Experimental results have been explained using predictions of a self-consistent 0D discharge and plasma reactivity modelling, and reduced kinetic schemes for OH have been validated. It has been shown that recombination of H- and O-atoms, as well as reaction of O with the hydroperoxy radical HO2, plays a very important role in the production of OH radicals in the mixture with ethane. H is a key species for production of OH and HO2 radicals. As for ethane, O, H and HO2 are key species for the production of OH in the case of ethene, but carbonated radicals, following the partial oxidation of the hydrocarbon molecule by O, also play a non-negligible role. The rate constant for O- and H-atom recombination has been estimated to be 3 x 10(-30) cm(6) s(-1) at near ambient temperature, consistent with LIF measurements on OH for both mixtures with ethane and ethene.									48	0	0	0	2	0	48			0022-3727			WOS:000246577200018

We successfully synthesized Co-CoOx anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon via a facile sand-bath method (SBM), i.e., Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM). The as-obtained Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM) exhibited overwhelming superiorities to Co-CoO/N-C prepared by conventional heat treatment (CHT), particularly in electrochemical performance of ORR. Although Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM) showed smaller specific surface area of 276.8 m(2)/g than that of 939.5 m(2)/g from Co-CoO/N-C (CHT), the Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM) performed larger pore diameter and more Co3O4 active component resulting in better ORR performance in 0.1 mol/L KOH solution. The Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM) delivered onset potential of 0.91 V vs. RHE, mid-wave potential of 0.85 V vs. RHE and limited current density of 5.46 mA/cm(2) much better than those of the Co-CoO/N-C (CHT). Furthermore, Co-CoOx/N-C (SBM) showed greater stability and better methanol tolerance superior to the commercial 20 wt% Pt/C.

However, it delivers a low reversible practical capacity (<200 mA h g(-1)) due to the irreversible oxygen redox at high potentials (>4.5 V). Herein, heavy fluorination (9.5%) is successfully implemented in the layered anionic framework of a Li-Mn-O-F (LMOF) cathode through a unique ion-exchange route. F substitution with O stabilizes the layered anionic framework, completely inhibits the O-2 evolution during the first cycle, and greatly enhances the reversibility of oxygen redox, delivering an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 389 mA h g(-1), which is 85% of the theoretical capacity of Li2MnO3. Moreover, it also induces a thin spinel shell coherently forming on the particle surface, which greatly improves the surface structure stability, making LMOF exhibit a superior cycling stability (a capacity retention of 91.8% after 120 cycles at 50 mA g(-1)) and excellent rate capability. These findings stress the importance of stabilizing the anionic framework in developing high-performance low-cost cathodes for next-generation Li-ion batteries.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000724097600001	34850552

The oxides were prepared at 150 degrees C and deposited by spray pyrolysis onto titanium substrates. The oxygen reduction reaction (orr) occurs through "interactive" and "parallel" pathways, and the ratio of O-2 molecules reduced to OH- ions with respect to those reduced to HO2- ions depends on the oxide stoichiometry and on the applied overpotential. The formation of HO2- increases when the manganese concentration increases. The results obtained for the orr show that the number of electrons transferred per O-2 molecule decreases from 3 to 2 and the ratio k(1)/k(2) (the rate constants for direct reduction to OH- and indirect reduction to HO2-) increases, respectively, in the overpotential studied range (-0.05 to -0.6 V). The Mn3+, ions placed in the B-sites of the spinel structure seem to be the active centres, where hydrogen peroxide is formed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focused on phase evolution, microstructural changes and element distribution during the roasting of the widely used Nd-Fe-B and high-potential Ce-Fe-B scrap powders at 800 degrees C. The sustained oxidation of Fe to Fe2O3 and the constant formation of composite RE oxides were the main reaction processes with increasing roasting cycles for the two scrap powders. The complete oxidation phases consisted of NdBO3, NdFeO3 and Fe2O3 for the Nd-Fe-B scrap powder, while the final products were NdBO3, GdFeO3 and Fe2O3 as well as individual CeO2 for the Ce-Fe-B scrap powder. An oxygen diffusion front was observed, forming a dark gray oxidized layer with almost the same thickness on the large particle surface. Additionally, a Fe2O3 layer covered the particle surface when the oxidation of the two scrap powders was complete. In oxidized Nd-Fe-B particles, the observed white regions corresponded to the oxidized intergranular Ndrich phase as indicated by the almost same size and position before and after roasting. In Ce-Fe-B particles, the oxidized intergranular phase appeared to gather and grow, and a RE-rich layer appeared between the oxide/unoxidized layer. Conclusively, the iron-outward diffusion and the oxygeninward diffusion were dominated by the oxidation of both Nd-Fe-B and Ce-Fe-B particles.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0334-6455	2191-0324		WOS:000573621600009

Here, taking advantage of the memory effect of layered double hydroxide (LDH), we report an energy-efficient neutral water electrolyzer material based on LDH with multiple vacancy defects. Benefiting from the improved electrical conductivity, larger electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and faster charge transfer, the NiFe LDH with O, Ni, and Fe vacancies exhibits a low overpotential of 87 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in a pH 7 buffer electrolyte. Impressively, the as-fabricated vacancy-containing NiFe LDH (v-NiFe LDH) splits water with a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) at similar to 1.60 V in a two-electrode device, outperforming most other water-splitting catalysts in neutral media. Such an electrolyzer setup could be powered by a commercial 2.0 V solar cell, producing hydrogen at a current density as high as 100 mA/cm(2).									63	8	0	0	4	0	65			2380-8195			WOS:000472121800027

The structural parameters were extracted from the XRD traces by performing a Rietveld refinement analysis. The phase formation occurs in three distinct stages. In stage I (first 10 min of milling), RuO2 and Ti reacts to form RuTi, Ru, and TiO, with some other oxide phases of titanium (Ti2O3, and TiO2). In stage II (between 10 and 60 min), the reaction slows down and the titanium dioxides are being reduced. In stage III, decomposition of RuTi through reaction with Ti2O3 occurs, to yield to the formation of TiO and Ru. In stage I, the reaction rate is very high, for example, 34.7 wt % of RuTi is formed after only 10 min of milling. It is argued that such rapid reaction rate is due to the enthalpy of the redox reaction occurring between Ti and RuO2 which raised the local temperature and thus favors the atomic interdiffusion. Finally, a series of experiments performed as a function of the milling intensity points to the existence of an energy threshold below which the combustion reaction between Ti and RuO2 does not occur.

However, the heat treatment involved in the material preparation excites Fe aggregating into nanosized species with low activity rather than single-atom Fe sites. Herein, we propose a ceria-assisted strategy to preferentially generate active single-atom Fe sites in Fe-N-C materials, which involves oxidative polymerization of pyrrole, Ce3+ and Fe3+ adsorption, and subsequent heat treatment. Because of its spatial confinement and strong trapping for Fe atoms, ceria can effectively suppress agglomeration of isolated Fe atoms and stabilize the Fe atoms by bonding to O in the lattice during the heat treatment, leading to a high content of atomically dispersed Fe (4.6 wt %). Accordingly, the final catalyst showed ultrahigh ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.915 V and kinetic current density of 7.15 mA cm(-2) at 0.9 V. When used at the cathode in anion exchange membrane fuel cell, a maximum power density of 496 mW cm(-2) was achieved, which is one of the best performance reported in the literature for Fe-N-C-type electrocatalysts.									57	6	0	0	1	0	59			2155-5435			WOS:000516887400006

Changes in photoluminescence (PL) energy following hydrosilylation of SiNCs with alkyl-terminated surfaces are most often ascribed to enhanced quantum confinement in the smaller cores of oxidized NCs or to oxygen-induced defect emission. We have investigated the PL properties of alkyl-functionalized SiNCs prepared using two related methods: thermal and photochemical hydrosilylation. Photochemically functionalized SiNCs exhibit higher emission energies than the thermally functionalized equivalent. While microsecond lifetime emission attributed to carrier recombination within the NC core was observed from all samples, much faster, size-independent nanosecond lifetime components were only observed in samples prepared using photochemical hydrosilylation that possessed substantial surface oxidation. In addition, photochemically modified SiNCs exhibit higher absolute photoluminescent quantum yields (AQY), consistent with radiative recombination processes occurring at the oxygen-based defects. Correlating spectrally- and time-resolved PL measurements and XPS-derived relative surface oxidation for NCs prepared using different photoassisted hydrosilylation reaction times provides evidence the PL blue-shift as well as the short-lived PL emission observed for photochemically functionalized SiNCs are related to the relative concentration of oxygen surface defects.									50	0	0	0	3	0	50			2330-4022			WOS:000355066900006

Three different supports (MgAl2O4, NiAl2O4 and CoAl2O4) were prepared by coprecipitation. X-ray diffraction line broadening indicated that the mean particle size of the deposited perovskite depended on the spinel used as support. Oxygen evolution measurements carried out in helium in the temperature range from 300 to 1360 K showed that the thermal decomposition proceeded similarly on all three supported catalysts, beginning at about 800 K. The amount of oxygen which evolved was found to depend on the particle size of the perovskite. The smaller the perovskite particles were, the more stable they were toward thermal decomposition. Kinetic tests were performed in a fixed-bed microreactor at 600-1200 K and atmospheric pressure using a reactant mixture with a ratio CH4:O2 = 1:4. The reaction rate per gram perovskite, measured at 770 K, was more than ten times higher for La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x/MgAl2O4 than for unsupported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x. The high activity of the MgAl2O4-supported perovskite is attributed to the high dispersion of the perovskite on this catalyst, leading to a larger active surface area compared to the unsupported La0.8Sr0.2MnO3+x.									58	3	0	0	0	1	62			0926-3373			WOS:A1994PK27700008

However, these goals are difficult to achieve simultaneously due to the severe side reaction - the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we successfully synthesized coordinatively unsaturated nickel-nitrogen (Ni-N) sites doped within porous carbon with a nickel loading as high as 5.44 wt% by pyrolysis of Zn/Ni bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework-8. Over the Ni-N composite catalysts, the CO current density increases with the overpotential and reaches 71.5 +/- 2.9 mA cm(-2) at -1.03 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), while maintaining a high CO Faradaic efficiency of 92.0-98.0% over a wide potential range of -0.53 to -1.03 V (vs. the RHE). Density functional theory calculations suggest that the CO2RR occurs more easily than the HER over the coordinatively unsaturated Ni-N site. Therefore, highly doped and coordinatively unsaturated Ni-N sites achieve high current density and Faradaic efficiency of the CO2RR simultaneously, breaking current limits in metal-nitrogen composite catalysts.									431	29	0	0	19	0	434			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000432599100007

Water electrolysis, a green and sustainable method for hydrogen production, is limited by the lack of nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that exhibit high performance. In this study, novel S-substituted Ni2P nanowires with large aspect ratios were successfully grown on nickel foam (Ni2P(S)/NF) using a facile one-step phosphating-sulfuration heat treatment process. The as-prepared Ni2P(S)/NF exhibited enhanced activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performed both in alkaline and acidic media. It only required overpotentials of 171 and 208 mV to drive current densities of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH solution and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. The characterization studies and density functional theory calculations suggested that the enhanced catalytic activity can be ascribed to the in situ growth of nanowires on nickel foam, the 1D nanowires morphology with high length-to-diameter ratio, appropriate free energy of hydrogen adsorption, and enhanced H2O binding activity. This work will provide inspiration for the development of non-precious metal HER catalysts.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0363-907X	1099-114X		WOS:000658039200001

Here, we design a new class of valence-variable metal-modified CuCo2S4 thiospinels, termed as v-M-CuCo2S4/NF (v-M = Mn, V, Cr), to achieve large-current-density OER performance. The introduction of valence-variable metals (v-M) can promote the generation of a special oxyhydroxide-like active phase with a contractive interatomic Co-Co distance, which breaks the limit of the inherent linear scaling relationship and causes the OER on v-M-CuCo2S4/NF to follow a more efficient oxide path mechanism. Therefore, v-M-CuCo2S4/NF, taking Mn-CuCo2S4/NF as a representative, delivers low overpotentials of 255 and 378 mV to achieve large current densities of 500 and 1500 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolytes. The optimal catalyst shows a large mass activity of 3000 A g(metal)(-1) and a high turnover frequency of 16 500 h(-1) at a low overpotential of 378 mV (1500 mA cm(-2)), tens of times larger than commercial RuO2/NF. The design principle provides some hints for optimizing abundant spinel materials as large current density OER catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000869390500001

Ag-based alloys have many advantages over platinum group catalysts due to their low cost, high stability, and acceptable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in alkaline solutions. Nevertheless, compared to commercial Pt/C-20%, their catalytic activity still cannot meet the demand of commercialization. In this study, a kind of catalysts screening strategy on AgxCu100-x nanoalloys is reported, containing the surface modification method, studies of activity enhancement mechanism, and applied research on zinc-air batteries. The results exhibit that the role of selective dealloying (DE) or galvanic displacement (GD) is limited by the "parting limitation", and this "parting limitation" determines the surface topography, position of d-band center, and ORR performance of AgxCu100-x alloys. The GD-Ag55Cu45 and DE-Ag25Cu75 catalysts alloys present excellent ORR performance that is comparable to Pt/C-20%. The relationship between electronic perturbation and specific activity demonstrates that positive shift of the d-band center (approximate to 0.12 eV, relative to Ag) for GD-Ag55Cu45 is beneficial for ORR, which is contrary to Pt-based alloys (negative shift, approximate to 0.1 eV). Meanwhile, extensive electrochemical and electronic structure characterization indicates that the high work function of GD-Ag55Cu45 (4.8 eV) is the reason behind their excellent durability for zinc-air batteries.									20	1	0	0	1	0	20			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000400982300007	28296197

Random mass change observed during the first hour stems from a non-protective scale. The variation of mass gain with time is expressed by near-parabolic rate law during 0-8 h time period, and by relations indicating slower kinetics during 8-24 h, with parabolic rate constants (k(p)) decreasing sharply. Microstructural examination has shown a continuously evolving layered oxide scale comprising La2Si2O7, borosilicate glass (BSG), ZrSiO4, and ZrO2, where the BSG layer growth rate scales linearly with LaB6 content during 0-8 h, but shows an opposite trend on further exposure. During both time periods (0-8 and 8-24 h), k(p) decreased following a linear relationship with increasing BSG layer thickness, indicating its key role as diffusion barrier for oxygen.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0955-2219	1873-619X		WOS:000564255500004

The transparent film of SnO2(Sb) on silica prepared by spray pyrolysis has a uniform and smooth surface with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness ranging from 1 to 2 nm. Its microstructure is constituted of coalesced particles with an average diameter and height of 30 and 6 nm, respectively. Anodic polarization at potentials near the oxygen evolution reaction region (OER) or potential cycling induces small alterations on the microstructure of the electrode, observable only in submicron range by AFM analysis. Cathodic polarization at potentials in the region of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), however, strongly damages the film. AFM and STM examination revealed that the particle boundaries are attached and both vertical and lateral dimensions of the particles decrease. From the observations, it can be inferred that during the cathodic polarization SnO is formed, and destruction of the film occurs by dissolution of that more soluble oxide. In situ STM experiments showed that at the initial stages the particles of the damaged film can acquire dimensions even larger than the initial size by anodic polarization. Finally, ii can be concluded that a smooth and compact film with few defects is less susceptible to degradation. (C) 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

The structure, phase, morphology and electronic environment of MoO3, g-C3N4 and Cu in the composite were determined by various characterization methods. The oxygen vacancies of MoO3 were ascertained by UV-DRS, Raman, and XPS analysis. The formation of the heterostructure was characterised by electrochemical measurements. The photocatalytic performance of the composite was investigated by the water reduction reaction and the reduction of an important inorganic pollutant, Cr(VI). In the presence of Cu NPs, the H-2 evolution of the MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid was found to be 652 mu mol h(-1) with an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 13.46%, and up to 95% of Cr(VI) was reduced using citric acid as a hole scavenger. The remarkably enhanced photocatalytic performance was attributed to the combined effect of the double Z-scheme mechanism and defective MoO3. The in situ formation process of the MoO3/g-C3N4 hybrid followed a direct Z-scheme charge transfer by generating a great number of defects at the solid-solid interface, similar to that of a conductor, and offered low electrical resistance, whereas loading of Cu NPs built up an indirect Z-scheme charge transfer to establish the double Z-scheme charge transfer mechanism. This hybrid material produces a photocurrent density of 12.1 mA cm(-2), in good agreement with the photo-catalytic activity. This study highlights the facilitation effect of MoO3 due to oxygen vacancies and charge transfer through the double Z-scheme mechanism to open up a new window in the field of 2D nanostructured photocatalytic materials.									160	8	0	0	25	0	161			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000428788200021	29542755

Here, we demonstrate the carbon dotsPt modified polyaniline nanosheets grown on carbon cloth (CDs/Pt-PANI) can serve as stable and high-efficient electrocatalyst in pH-universal electrolyte for HER. The overpotential for optimal CDs/Pt-PANI electrocatalyst can be lowered to 30 mV at 10 mA.cm(-2) when Pt loading was only 8.1 mu g.cm(-2) (the Pt content in commercial 20 wt% Pt/C is 22.4 mu g.cm(-2)), showing exceptional HER efficiency with a small Tafel slope 41.7 mV.dec(-1) in acidic solution. Meanwhile, the optimal CDs/Pt-PANI electrocatalyst exhibits well stability with 17 mV potential shift after 20 h, which is 0.06 times than that of commercial 20 wt% Pt/C (286 mV). It is noticeable, the optimal CDs/Pt-PANI electrocatalyst is superior to 20 wt% Pt/C with HER performance in pH-universal electrolyte (acidic, neutral and basic). The efficient and stable HER performance of CDs/Pt-PANI should ascribe to the synergy in the CDs, Pt and PANI, in which the surface functional groups of CDs can connect tightly with PANI and improve the stability of Pt, simultaneously, the PANI and Pt provide the high-efficiency in HER.									48	0	0	0	1	0	48			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000480669500028

However, the side effects of hybrid anion and cation redox (HACR) reactions, such as oxygen release and phase collapse that result from global oxygen migration (GOM), have prohibited the commercialization of LXMO. GOM not only destabilizes the oxygen sublattice in cycling, aggravating the well-known voltage fading, but also intensifies electrolyte decomposition and Mn dissolution, causing severe full-cell performance degradation. Herein, an artificial surface prereconstruction (ASR) for Li(1.2)Mn(0.6)Ni(0.2)O(2)particles with a molten-molybdate leaching is conducted, which creates a crystal-dense anion-redox-free LiMn(1.5)Ni(0.5)O(4)shell that completely encloses the LXMO lattice (ASR-LXMO). Differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrate that GOM is shut down in cycling, which not only stabilizes HACR in ASR-LXMO, but also mitigates the electrolyte decomposition and Mn dissolution. ASR-LXMO displays greatly stabilized cycling performance as it retains 237.4 mAh g(-1)with an average discharge voltage of 3.30 V after 200 cycles. More crucially, while the pristine LXMO cycling cannot survive 90 cycles in a pouch full-cell matched with a commercial graphite anode and lean (2 g A(-1)h(-1)) electrolyte, ASR-LXMO shows high capacity retention of 76% after 125 cycles in full-cell cycling.									45	2	0	0	3	0	46			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000555860300001

Monitoring well-known surface adsorption processes of H-2, O-2, NO, and CO by in operando angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we selectively modify the oxidation state of individual Ru surface sites and identify the electronic nature of the FBSS: stabilized by bridging oxygen O-br, p(z), the FBSS disperses along < 001 > oriented chains of bridging Ru-br, 4d(z)(2), orbitals, collapses upon O hr removal, yet remains surprisingly unaffected by the oxidation state of the undercoordinated 1f-cus-Ru species. This directly reflects in the ability of RuO2(110) to oxidize CO and H-2 along with its inability to oxidize NO, demonstrating the FBSS's active role in catalytic charge transfer processes at the oxygen bridge sites. Our synergetic approach provides momentum-resolved insights to the interplay of a catalyst's delocalized electronic band structure and the localized orbitals of its surface reactants-a route toward a microscopic understanding of heterogeneous catalysis.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2155-5435			WOS:000618540300055

Pyrolysis experiments at two different Curie temperatures of 485 degrees C and 590 degrees C were carried out on all the three oil shales respectively to study the influence of temperature on the pyrolysis shale oils. The results showed that in the sedimentation process of kerogen, part of the aliphatic chains are transferred into aromatic rings leading to the decrease of aliphatics and increase of aromatics. Also, part of the oxygen-containing functional groups are removed leading to the decrease of oxygen-containing organic compound proportion in the shale oil. With the increase of temperature from 485 degrees C to 590 degrees C, large amounts of n-alkanes were transferred into cycloalkanes and alkenes due to the secondary cracking reactions. Oxygen-containing organic compounds including phenols, alcohols, esters, and ketones existed in the pyrolysis oil products of all samples. Contents of alcohols increased with temperature while that of esters and ketones decreased obviously. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that the conventionally surface-supported Ru electrocatalysts are actually not stable under harsh conditions due to the weak interaction between Ru and supports, although they are stable under mild conditions. Here, we report a lattice-confined approach to concurrently enhance the stability and intrinsic activity of Ru via confining ultrafine Ru clusters into TiO2 lattice frameworks. Impressively, such confined Ru delivers outstanding performance for HER under harsh conditions, such as a small overpotenital of 116 mV at 800 mA cm(-2), and long-time stability for 200-h continuous HER at 300 mA cm(-2). As uncovered by both computational and experimental results, the lattice-confined strategy can significantly enhance the interaction between Ru and TiO2 for promoting the electron transfer from Ru to TiO2, thereby strongly stabilizing Ru for avoiding the dissociation and aggregation of Ru during the stability test. Therefore, the lattice-confined strategy may stand out as a robust approach for boosting the activity and stability of electrocatalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000833421000004

Facile hydrogen production through water splitting has become a popular alternative source of energy owing to the numerous environmentally friendly and economic benefits it provides. Additionally, it is preferred due to the depletion of non-renewable energy resources, pollution caused by the burning of non-renewable energy resources, and climate change. Hydrogen is generated from water and acts as a clean energy without contributing to carbon emissions. Various water-splitting methods such as electrolysis, thermochemical, mechanocatalysis, plasmolysis, photocatalysis, and photoelectrocatalysis can be applied to obtain hydrogen and oxygen. This review highlights the multifunctional materials used in photo-electrochemical water splitting and their superior properties for producing carbon-free energy from water. Multifunctional materials help reduce aqueous protons to hydrogen and oxidize water to oxygen during the splitting of water. This paper discusses a wide class of materials such as carbon materials, metal-organic frameworks, perovskites, and semiconducting oxides for efficient hydrogen production. Different types of water-splitting methods and multifunctional materials with varying properties can lead to improved results. The review sheds light upon the hydrogen economy and future prospects, elucidating the selection of multifunctional materials for efficient hydrogen production.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000827660400001

This method involved the protection of nanoclusters with PVP and the assembly of CeMOF around Pd nanoclusters under mild condition. The small size and high dispersion resulting from physical confinement effect were inherited in the derivates as CeO2 nanosheets confining Pd nanoclusters catalysts. The relative position of Pd and Ce was regulated via varying pyrolysis parameter, which determined the confinement state of Pd clusters. A critical state was found where Pd clusters were maintained at high dispersion and possessed unlimited accessibility for CO. The specific confining structure and low surface concentration depressed the oxygen supply, resulting in the formation of substoichiometric PdOx, which interacted with CeO2 and formed Pd-Ce-O(s) clusters. With the improved dispersion and high content of Pd-Ce-O(s) clusters, the catalyst converted 100% CO at 63 degrees C with a Pd loading of 1.07%. The reaction followed Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which CO adsorbed on Pd-Ce-O(s) clusters and reacted with the highly active oxygen species. (C) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Urea. was used as a combustion fuel. The calcinations were affected at the 400-700 degrees C temperature range. The produced catalysts were characterized by using XRD and SEM analyses. The obtained results revealed that silver metal supported on Al2O3 and/or Fe2O3 represent the major constituents of all the calcinations products, i.e. Ag/FexAl2-xO3. However, two different interfaces are involved in the two test reactions, all the catalysts were able to decompose both reactants yielding oxygen as a joint product. Meanwhile, it was found nitrous oxide destruction activity increases with decreasing both silver particles size and iron content in the catalysts substrate. On the contrary, increasing iron content in the different catalyst was found to enhance hydrogen peroxide decomposition activity. Moreover, a synergic effect was observed for the catalysts having Al:Fe ratio of 0.5:1.5. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance of hematite photoanodes can be improved by modification with the oxygen evolution catalyst CoBi. The current density at 1.23 V of the pristine hematite under one sun is 0.88 mA cm(-2) and it increases to 1.12 mA cm(-2) after CoBi modification (similar to 27% improvement). The presence of a CoBi cocatalayst layer is proposed to improve the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and also to prevent electron-hole recombination at the surface via passivating surface defects as well as suppressing the tunneling of electrons from the hematite core, thus improving the photocurrents and resulting in a negative shift of photocurrent onset potentials. These effects of CoBi modification are supported by experimental data obtained by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), PEC and incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) measurements. To investigate the electronic structure of the CoBi cocatalyst deposited on hematite, XPS and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) are employed. Co K-edge spectra at different potentials and light conditions are recorded. This makes the present work different from most of the previous studies. Using a quantitative analysis method, information on the mean oxidation state of Co in the CoBi film under applied potential and illumination is revealed. We also compare different methods for determining the oxidation state from the edge position and find that the integral method and half height methods are most suitable. In summary, the present work underlines the improvement of the semi-conductor/cocatalyst interface of oxygen evolving photoanodes and strengthens the importance of in situ XAS spectroscopy when studying catalysts. This study is the first report so far combining the studies of the PEC performance of a CoBi modified hematite nanorod array photoanode and in situ XAS at the Co K-edge.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000415989000016	29095446

KGPDC catalyzes the Mg2+ ion-dependent decarboxylation of 3-keto-L-gulonate 6-phosphate to yield L-xylulose 5-phosphate and CO2; OMPDC catalyzes the metal ion-independent decarboxylation of OMP to UMP and CO2. Structural studies have shown that KGPDC and OMPDC share several strictly conserved active site residues that are used differently by each enzyme to catalyze their mechanistically distinct reactions. Although the mechanism of the KGPDC-catalyzed reaction has yet to be elucidated, it is thought to proceed via a Mg2+ ion-stabilized 1,2-enediolate intermediate. Here we report the crystal structures of KGPDC complexed with L-gulonate 6-phosphate, L-threonohydroxamate 4-phosphate, and L-xylitol 5-phosphate, analogues of the substrate, enediolate intermediate, and product, as well as with the product, L-Xylulose 5-phosphate, at 1.2, 1.8, 1.7, and 1.8 Angstrom resolution, respectively. These structures support a mechanism that involves the formation of a cis-1,2-enediolate intermediate. Contrary to expectations, the geometry of the intermediate does not involve bidentate coordination of both enediolate oxygen atoms to the Mg2+ ion but rather involves only the coordination of the oxygen on C2 to the Mg2+ ion. The oxygen atom on Cl instead forms hydrogen bonds to both Lys64 and Asp67, two strictly conserved active site residues. Lys64 also interacts with the oxygen on C2 and may serve to stabilize a cis conformation of the 1,2-enediolate. These structures also implicate His136 to be the general acid that protonates the 1,2-enediolate intermediate. This study further demonstrates that multiple unrelated enzyme functions can evolve from a single active site architecture without regard for substrate binding affinity or mechanism.									12	0	0	0	12	0	14			0006-2960			WOS:000186133900002	14567674

O atom losses compared to C2H2 losses on TiO2 surface after plasma exposure: an explanation for plasma/TiO2 synergy								2008 IEEE 35th International Conference on Plasma Science								1 pp.	1 pp.		10.1109/PLASMA.2008.4590896				2008	2008	Plasma photocatalyst coupling is an interesting combination for air treatment, but the mechanisms of plasma TiO2 synergy is still not well understood. The time evolution of O atom density in the gas phase during the post-discharge of a pulsed N2-O2 DC plasma is studied using a plasma induced fluorescence technique (PIF) where a main long pulse creates the plasma and a shorter one re-excites atoms in the time post-discharge. The surface loss coefficient of O atoms on pyrex, porous silica, porous TiO2 is measured, this latter being a photocatalytic material. When nano cluster of TiO2 are deposited on porous silica, the loss coefficient is first high and comparable to the case of the porous silica, but decrease after 1 ms. In parallel the time evolution of the O atoms is monitored during the main plasma pulse as already measured (Guaitella et al. 2005). It is shown that, when nanoclusters of TiO2 are deposited on silica fibers a large amount of O atoms are desorbed at the beginning of plasma pulses. These O atoms which stay available after duration longer than 1 s could explain the IR laser absorption measurement performed to monitor C2H2 decay on surface pre-treated by oxygen containing plasmas. Indeed, when TiO2 surface is exposed during several minutes to air plasma, C2H2 introduced in the reactor after shut off the plasma is lost on the surface probably because of oxidation reactions at the surface with the adsorbed O atoms on TiO2.					2008 IEEE 35th International Conference on Plasma Science2008 IEEE 35th International Conference on Plasma Science	15-19 June 200815-19 June 2008		Karlsruhe, GermanyKarlsruhe, Germany	0	0	0		0	0	0					978-1-4244-1929-6	INSPEC:10154070

The formation of an ion-pair surface complex of protonated dimethylketimine (DMKH+)/skeletal oxygen anion was observed in the IR spectra at room temperature. The complex is characterized by the stretching vibration v(C=N) of the > C=NH2+ group at 1707 cm(-1). The assignment was confirmed by a new band at 1683 cm(-1), corresponding to > C=NHD+ group formed after the H/D exchange of one proton bonded to nitrogen at temperatures above 120 degrees C. The formation of DMKH+ was also found on other acidic zeolites, in particular H-beta, HY, and HM. It is suggested that the activity of zeolites in the formation of DMKH+ increases with their increasing acidity. Gaseous desorption products during temperature-programmed desorption, probed by MS, revealed the evolution of acetonitrile, propene, allene, and isobutene. The experimental results are compared with quantum chemical calculations based on the optimized model system of DMKIH+/zeolite cluster using density functional theory.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1463-9076			WOS:000080565200034

Although bonding-confinement strategies can be used to effectively regulate and strengthen the coordination of isolated metal atoms, the precise control of the coordination environment of metal centers remains a challenge. Herein, we report a rational strategy by which to bond iron phthalocyanine (FePc) on pre-synthesized Fe-N-C materials to further obtain anatomically dispersed Fe-N-4 catalysts. The axial coordination of O-FeN4 sites to form a Fe-O-Fe bridge bond lowers the overpotential for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Incorporation of the O atom stimulates the adsorbed O-2 to obtain more electrons, thereby enhancing the adsorption and activation of O-2. The catalyst demonstrates a half-wave potential of 0.866 V (versus RHE) and kinetic current density of 11.49 mA cm(-2), significantly outperforming commercial Pt/C. The primary Zn-air battery assembled with such a catalyst exhibits a high current density of 136 mA cm(-2) @ 1.0 V and a maximum power density of 205 mW cm(-2), supporting its potential feasibility in practical applications. Our findings provide a new avenue for tuning the coordination environment of single-atom catalysts to enhance their ORR activity.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2052-1553			WOS:000803087000001		
J	Ergut, Ali; Levendis, Yiannis A.; Richter, Henning; Howard, Jack B.; Carlson, Joel								The effect of equivalence ratio on the soot onset chemistry in one-dimensional, atmospheric-pressure, premixed ethylbenzene flames								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				151	1-2			173	195		10.1016/j.combustflame.2007.04.009				OCT 2007	2007	An investigation was conducted on the evolution of products of incomplete combustion (PIC) emitted from one-dimensional, laminar, atmospheric-pressure ethylbenzene flames in the vicinity of the soot onset threshold. The objective of this study was to identify the role of the fuel-to-air equivalence ratio in the evolution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and other PIC as soot precursors, just prior to and subsequent to soot onset in premixed flames. Liquid ethylbenzene was prevaporized in nitrogen and blended with an oxygen-nitrogen mixture. Upon ignition, premixed flat flames were stabilized over a burner at atmospheric pressure. Temperature measurements and product sampling were conducted at various heights above the burner. Collected samples were analyzed for soot, PAH, oxygenated species, fixed gases, and light hydrocarbons. Three flames were investigated in the vicinity of the observed soot onset threshold, at equivalence ratios of phi(1) = 1.68, phi(2) = 1.74, and phi(3) = 1.83. By adjusting the amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, and fuel, both the maximum measured flame temperature and the spatial profile of the temperature were kept nearly constant as the equivalence ratio was varied. The cold gas velocity through the burner was also kept nearly constant. Changes in species concentration profiles prior to, at and beyond the sooting limit were evaluated. The results indicated that the soot onset limit is not a function of flame temperature alone; i.e., while the maximum measured flame temperatures was kept fairly constant, the flame could be either sooting, at the sooting limit or nonsooting depending on the equivalence ratio. A detailed chemical kinetic model, previously tested against sooting premixed benzene and ethylbenzene flames, was used to gain insight in chemical processes involved in soot formation. A reaction flux analysis was conducted to determine the pathways for ethylbenzene consumption, as well as for benzene and naphthalene formation. Examination of experimental measurements of species along the axis of the flame, in view of the theoretical predictions, showed a rather direct correlation of acetylene to soot formation. Moreover, a correlation between the consumption of ethylbenzene pyrolyzates, such as styrene, and soot formation at the soot onset was also apparent. Whereas the model's results were very encouraging, additional development is deemed necessary to improve its predictive capability in the challenging regime of soot inception.

To prepare nitrogen-doped graphene aerogel (N-rGO) and to decorate IrO2 nanoparticles on N-rGO, combination of modified Hummers' method and hydrothermal method was employed. Successful fabrication of IrO2/N-rGO was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and its catalytic activity was evaluated by electrochemical methods. TEM image of IrO2/N-rGO shows that the IrO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 1.2 nm are uniformly dispersed on the N-rGO surface. The XPS results revealed the presence of nitrogen and IrO2 in the N-rGO aerogel substrate. The IrO2/N-rGO catalyst also shows high activity for OER. Our results suggest IrO2/N-rGO is a promising candidate as anode for water electrolysis system.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			1938-5862			INSPEC:18500738

Different compositions of MCr2O4 (M=Ni, NiFe, Zn, Mg) and MTi2O4 (Li, Mg, Mn) have been synthesized by solid state synthesis. Pure and doped Cr-based spinels exhibit low conductivities at the operating temperatures of PEMECs (<10-4 S cm-1), while Ti-based spinels showed very high conductivities at room temperature (~10-100 S cm-1). Cr-spinels proved to be very stable to chemical corrosion testing, while Ti-spinels manifested substantial weight loss. The most promising materials (LiTi2O4, MnCr2O4, Cu-MnCr2O4) showed redox activity at potentials >1.5 V vs SHE. LiTi2O4 is completely oxidized upon cycling up to 2.0 V vs SHE. Mixtures of IrO2/oxide support deposited on glassy carbon were tested toward OER, which showed a 10% higher absolute current at 2.0 V vs SHE in the case of IrO2/Cu-MnCr2O4 compared with pure IrO2.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1938-5862			INSPEC:18500740		
J	Yu, Ming-Jia; Chen, Shi-Lu								From NAD(+) to Nickel Pincer Complex: A Significant Cofactor Evolution Presented by Lactate Racemase								CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL				23	31			7545	7557		10.1002/chem.201700405				JUN 1 2017	2017	Lactate racemase (LarA), a new nickel enzyme discovered recently, catalyzes the racemization between d-and l-lactates with a novel nickel pincer cofactor (Ni-PTTMN) derived from nicotinic acid. In this study, by using DFT and a 200-atom active-site model, LarA is revealed to employ a modified proton-coupled hydride-transfer mechanism in which a hydride is transferred to a cofactor pyridine carbon from the substrate a-carbon along with proton transfer from the substrate hydroxy group to a histidine, and then moved back from the opposite side. Tyr294 and Lys298 provide significant acceleration effects by orientating substrates and stabilizing the negative charge developing at the substrate hydroxy oxygen. The barrier was determined to be 12.0 kcal mol(-1), which reveals enhanced racemase activity relative to the LarA reaction using NAD(+)-like cofactors. Compared with NAD(+), Ni-PTTMN has a stronger hydride-addition reactivity in moderate and high environmental polarity and may fit perfectly the moderately polar active site of LarA.									12	0	0	0	2	0	12			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000402648500023	28374531

In contrast to BiOCl and Ag-deposited BiOCl, Bi@BiOCl displayed enhanced photocatalytic activity and stability for NO removal under visible light irradiation. The surface plasmon resonance of Bi nanowires with different configurations was first simulated with a rigorous Maxwell solver. A significant enhancement of the electric field under visible light irradiation could be observed in the vicinity of the nanowires, and the maximum value of the field intensity was reached at the sharp corners, which behaved as the main active sites for the NO removal reaction. A new visible light photocatalysis mechanism was proposed for the enhanced performance of Bi@BiOCl with plasmonic Bi metal, exposed facets, and oxygen defects. Binanowires-deposited BiOCl with exposed {010} facets exhibited superior photocatalytic activity in comparison with the counterpart with {001} facets, which resulted from higher separation ability of charge carriers and their favorable morphological structure. The present work sheds new light on the photocatalysis mechanism involved with the cooperative effects of surface plasmon resonance (SPR), facets, and defects. As the Bi-based structured materials are abundant, there are numerous opportunities for construction of other high-performance plasmonic photocatalysts based on elemental Bi. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Then the paper compares the calculation of model with experimental results of references, and verifies the accuracy of the model. The evolution characteristics of nanosecond pulse discharge plasma under different air temperatures are obtained. Because the O, O-3 and NO have close relationship with the combustion, their formation mechanisms are discussed especially. With increasing temperature, there is no significant addition in O atoms and O-3 molecules. It is found that most of the O-2 molecules become O-2(V1) in higher temperature. The decreasing time of the O atoms is in accordance with the increasing time of O-3 molecules. Thus, the O-3 molecules are produced mainly by decayed O atoms. Increased air temperature will not produce more active particles which could assist the combustion. With the increasing temperature, the particle number density of NO increases fast. At last, they have reached an equilibrium value of the same. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									9	1	0	0	0	0	9			1359-4311			WOS:000373863000027

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were acquired in neutral phosphate buffer demonstrating that corroles exhibit a superior catalytic activity towards ORR than porphyrins, as demonstrated by more positive oxygen reduction peak potential (E-pr) and half-wave potential (E-1/2) values of corroles. Also, iron complexes performed better than cobalt ones, showing an ORR activity even superior to that of platinum taken as reference, as demonstrated by RDE experiments. We investigated the role of the axial ligand on the ORR activity of the macrocycles, and we found that E-pr and E-1/2 values are more positive along the series: PPh3Co < py(2)Co = mu-oxoFe(2) < FeCl. By contrast, there was not much difference in activity supporting the porphyrinoids on carbon nanotubes or carbon black pearls, indicating that the effect of carbon support is less important to that of the axial ligand. The results allowed pointing at iron corroles as a promising class of molecular catalysts for application as cathodes in biolectrochemical systems at neutral pH, such as microbial fuel cells.									9	0	0	0	3	0	9			1434-1948	1099-0682		WOS:000496008500001

However, the efficiency is still low and the influence of laser engraving on the microstructure and properties of engraved surface also needs further study. By varying the assist gas (Argon, Compressed air, and Oxygen) of nanosecond laser engraving of Cr12MoV mould steel, the material removal rate and surface quality were compared, and the mechanisms of elemental diffusion and microstructural evolution in surface remelting layer were investigated to understand the variation in micro-hardness values. The results showed that the exothermal chemical reactions significantly increased the efficiency of laser engraving, but the surface quality was deteriorated and the detachment of elements C and Cr in remelting layer was promoted. Thus, lower hardness was observed for the remelted layer in the presence of oxygen or compressed air compared to Argon, although the micro-hardness of remelted layers was all increased attributed to grain refinements. Results suggested that the use of oxygen gas during rough engraving increased the material removal rate and reduced the cost, and the use of Argon gas at final engraving steps improved the quality and mechanical properties of the engraved surface.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0030-3992	1879-2545		WOS:000687055500004

Erstwhile efforts have culminated in the form of bioinspired models that not only mimic the function of the enzymes but also follow enzyme-like mechanism. Some of these synthetic mimics can override limitations such as oxygen sensitivity that has deterred the practical application of hydrogenase enzymes/models as viable hydrogen generation catalysts. This account summarizes a few such recent discoveries.									22	0	0	0	5	0	22			2451-9103			WOS:000483330900023		
J	Hasegawa, K; Kimura, Y; Ono, TA								Chloride cofactor in the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy								BIOCHEMISTRY				41	46			13839	13850		10.1021/bi026595n				NOV 19 2002	2002	Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, using midfrequency S-2/S-1 FTIR difference spectra, has been applied to studies of chloride cofactor in the photosynthetic oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) to determine the effects of Cl- depletion and monovalent anion substitution. Cl- depletion resulted in the disappearance of a large part of the amide I and II vibrational modes, and induced characteristic modification in the features of the stretching modes of the carboxylate ligands of the Mn cluster. The normal spectral features were largely restored by replenishment of Cl- except for some changes in amide bands. The overall features of Br--, I--, or NO3--substituted spectra were similar to those of the Cl-reconstituted spectrum, consistent with their ability to support oxygen evolution. In contrast, the spectrum was significantly altered by the replacement of Cl- with F- or CH3COO-, which resulted in marked suppression and distortion of both the carboxylate and amide bands. The activity of oxygen evolution restored by NO3- was as high as that. by Cl- when measured under limited light conditions, indicating that the NO3--substituted OEC is fully active in oxygen evolution, although with a slow turnover rate. The double-difference spectrum between the (NO3-)-N-14-substituted and (NO3-)-N-15-substituted S-2/S-1 difference spectrum showed isotopic bands for asymmetric NO stretching mode in the region of 1400-1300 cm(-1) due to NO3- bound to the Cl- site. This demonstrated structural coupling between the Cl- site and the Mn cluster. A proposed model for the isotopic bands suggested that Cl- as well as NO3- is not directly associated with the Mn cluster and exists in a more symmetric configuration and weaker binding state in the S-2 state than in the S-1 state. These results also suggest that Cl- is required for changes in the structure of the specific carboxylate ligand of the Mn cluster as well as the peptide backbone of protein matrixes upon the transition from S-1 to S-2.									48	2	0	0	33	0	48			0006-2960			WOS:000179236200042	12427048

To accelerate catalyst discovery, it is of pivotal importance to develop an approach that efficiently maps catalytic activity of nanoparticles onto geometry-based descriptors while considering the geometric strain and metal ligand of an active site. We demonstrate that there exist linear correlations between orbitalwise coordination numbers CN alpha and free formation energies of oxygen species (e.g., *OH and *OOH) at Pt sites. Kinetic analysis along with herein developed structure-activity relationships accurately predicts the activity trend of pure Pt nanoparticles (similar to 1-7 nm) toward oxygen reduction. Application of the approach to a search of Pt nanoalloys leads to several Pt monolayer core-shell nanostructures with enhanced oxygen reduction activity and reduced cost. The approach presented here facilitates a transition from traditional single-crystal models to nanoparticles in theory-guided catalyst discovery.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2156-8952	2156-8944		WOS:000447118400001	30183261

This work reports a hierarchical micro-sphere constructed by MoNi porous nanosheets derived from NiMoO4 microsphere, as a rapid Tafel-step-decided electrocatalyst towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Consequently, the synthesized MoNi hierarchical microsphere (MoNi HM) electrocatalyst exhibits an onset potential of as small as -7 mV vs. RHE, an operating potential of 72 mV for 10 mA cm(-2), and a low Tafel slope of 36.6 mV per decade in 1.0 M KOH. Furthermore, MoNi HM as cocatalyst and CdS nanowires as photocatalyst are physically mixed (MoNi HM/CdS NWs) and presentes a champion photocatalytic performance for H-2 production with a prominent H-2 generation rate of as high as 151.7 mu mol mg(-1) h(-1) at lambda > 420 nm light illumination. The large contact area between MoNi nanosheets and CdS nanowires endows the fast separation of photogenerated charge carriers to significantly facilitate the photocatalytic H-2 production.									68	3	0	0	3	1	69			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000464487500011

This has led researchers to focus towards developing highly active electrocatalysts. Our work takes a wholistic approach to understanding the key factors that influence the OER process. We focused on preparing a metallic electrocatalyst and tested out its OER performance using two different supporting electrolytes. We also studied the effect of crystal planes of the electrocatalyst on the OER process using computational simulation (CS) methods. For this, rhodium (Rh) thin film (RhTF) electrocatalysts on indium tin oxide (RhTF_ITO) were fabricated for OER through aerosol assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD). The prepared electrodes showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for OER (for 10 mA/cm(2) eta = 273 mV in 1.0 M KOH). The effect of the supporting electrolytes and the crystal planes of RhTF electrodes were analyzed using electroanalytical techniques and CS methods. Tafel slope (TS) analysis revealed that electron transfer kinetics was slower for the NaOH compared to the KOH. The scan rate (v) analysis indicated that there is weak electrostatic interaction between the hydrated outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) of Na+ and K+ ions with the adsorbed OH(ad) that impacts the OER process. With increasing v the restructuring of the electrochemical double layer (EDL) increases resulting in similar OER performance for both the supporting electrolytes. The micro-kinetic analysis showed that the rate determining step (RDS) for NaOH and KOH required around 1.67 eV and 1.07 eV. The density functional theory (DFT) analysis revealed that these energy values are closest to the Rh (111) plane reaction pathway. Adsorption locator (AL) analysis further revealed that the hydrated cations could directly get adsorbed on the Rh crystal planes hindering the electron transfer (ET) in the OER process. The DFT analysis further revealed that the lowest energy pathway for the OER process is followed on the Rh (220) plane. These analyses demonstrated that it is possible to fine tune the OER using supporting electrolyte and electrocatalysts that can work synergistically for getting the optimal OER performance.

Experiments and theory show that CeOx nanoparticles affect the dispersion of copper on titania, and on the formed copper-ceria interface, there are synergistic effects which favor water dissociation and the WGS reaction. The minimum energy path for the WGS reaction on the new highly active catalytic system Cu/CeOx/TiO2(110) has been predicted by theoretical calculations. Main steps such as adsorption-dissociation of water and *OCOH carboxyl intermediate formation-deprotonation have been characterized. In this very particular system, water splitting is no longer the rate-limiting step because it can dissociate overcoming an energy barrier of only 0.92 kcal/mol. One important insight of the present work is to show that easy full hydration of the ceria particles strongly lowers the reaction barrier for the deprotonation of the *OCOH intermediate and facilitates the evolution of the WGS reaction. For the first time, a system has been found on which the WGS reaction is able to work with all the involved energy barriers below 12 kcal/mol. This remarkable behavior makes the metal/CeOx/TiO2 family a potential candidate for industrial application as catalysts in the WGS reaction. The change in the metal-support interactions when going from Cu/TiO2 to Cu/CeOx/TiO2 illustrates the importance of optimizing the oxide phase when improving the performance of metal/oxide catalysts for the WGS.									35	2	0	0	1	0	36			2155-5435			WOS:000379457300065

Then, these Au-dt NPs were used as the cores for the fabrication of core-shell (CS) Au-dt-Pd NPs with ultrathin Pd layers, which also can bear compressive strain because of the formation of corrugated structured Pd shells led by the lateral confinement imposed by deformation twinning in the Au cores. The presence of compressive strain in the CS Au-dt-Pd NPs can result in the widening of the d-band width of the Pd shell and further the downshift of their d-band center, which can then improve the desorption ability of intermediates and still maintain the adsorption ability of the reactants because of the broad adsorption potentia range. Taking the oxidation reduction reaction and the ethanol oxidation reaction as examples, the as-prepared Au-dt-Pd NPs indeed exhibited superior catalytic performances because of the synergism of compressive strain and the electronic effect. Thus, our work opens a new way to introduce compressive strain in the Pd-based CS NP catalysts, which can achieve the enhancement in the electrocatalytic performance by combining the merit of compressive strain and the electronic effect.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000503918300053	31775499

The motile microaerophilic bacterium Azospirillum brasilense navigates oxygen gradients by aerotaxis in order to locate low oxygen concentrations that can support metabolism. When cells are exposed to elevated levels of oxygen in their surroundings, motile A. brasilense cells implement an alternative response to aerotaxis and form transient clumps by cell-to-cell interactions. Clumping was suggested to represent a behavior protecting motile cells from transiently elevated levels of aeration. Using the proteomics of wild-type and mutant strains affected in the extent of their clumping abilities, we show that cell-to-cell clumping represents a metabolic scavenging strategy that likely prepares the cells for further metabolic stresses. Analysis of mutants affected in carbon or nitrogen metabolism confirmed this assumption. The metabolic changes experienced as clumping progresses prime cells for flocculation, a morphological and metabolic shift of cells triggered under elevated-aeration conditions and nitrogen limitation. The analysis of various mutants during clumping and flocculation characterized an ordered set of changes in cell envelope properties accompanying the metabolic changes. These data also identify clumping and early flocculation to be behaviors compatible with the expression of nitrogen fixation genes, despite the elevated-aeration conditions. Cell-to-cell clumping may thus license diazotrophy to microaerophilic A. brasilense cells under elevated oxygen conditions and prime them for long-term survival via flocculation if metabolic stress persists.									28	0	0	0	26	0	28			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000365212800010	26407887

Quite originally, instead of saturating non-bridging oxygen (NBO) with hydrogen atoms as generally found in the literature for similar approaches, NBOs, which hold a negative charge if not saturated, have been substituted by isoelectronic fluorines whose mass is corrected in normal mode calculations to be equal to that of an oxygen. By adjusting the number of fluorines per silicon, the different Q coordination types characterizing the different classes of silicates are modeled. The relevance of this ensemble of clusters as a model to study the effect of polymerization on Raman intensities is established in several steps, the most important one being the qualitative reproduction of evolution of the Ip polymerization index with the number of bridging oxygen per silicon.

The composite photocatalyst prepared by this route exhibits closely contact interfaces between g-C3N4 and CNTs, as compared with the two ones obtained from the two-step and one-step methods previously reported, which lead to the reduced photoluminescence emission and longer life-time of the photogenerated carriers, and the increased photocurrent response. As a result, the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution rates of the WCN/CNTs composite are up to 45.1 mu mol/h and 7.14 mu mol/h, 10.02 and 4.61 times that of BCN, respectively, which are higher than those of the other two ones prepared by the previously reported methods. This one-pot microwave-assisted heating synthesis route is suitable for preparing the g-C3N4 based composite photocatalysts.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			0025-5408	1873-4227		WOS:000441491900020

A screen-printable ink has been developed that allows for the tailoring of the 2D-MoS2 content/mass used in the fabrication of the 2D-MoS2-SPEs, which critically affects the observed ORR. performance. In comparison to the graphite SPEs (GSPEs), the 2D-MoS2-SPEs are shown to exhibit an electrocatalytic behavior toward the ORR which is found, critically, to be reliant upon the percentage mass incorporation of 2D-MoS2 in the 2D-MoS2-SPEs; greater percentage mass of 2D-MoS2 incorporated into the 2D-MoS2SPEs results in a significantly less electronegative ORR onset potential and a greater signal output (current density). Using optimally fabricated 2D-MoS2-SPEs, an ORR onset and a peak current of approximately +0.16 V [vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)] and 1.62 mA cm(-2), respectively, are observed, which exceeds the 0.53 V (vs SCE) and 635,mu A cm(-2) performance of unmodified G-SPEs, indicating an electrocatalytic response toward the ORR utilizing the 2DMoS(2)-SP,Es. An investigation of the underlying electrochemical reaction mechanism of the ORR within acidic aqueous solutions reveals that the reaction proceeds via a direct four-electron process for all of the 2D-MoS2-SPE variants studied herein, where oxygen is electrochemically favorably reduced to water. The fabricated 2D-MoS2-SPEs are found to exhibit no degradation in the observed achievable current over the course of 1000 repeat scans. The production of such inks and the resultant mass-producible 2D-MoS2-SPEs mitigates the need to modify post hoc an electrode via the drop-casting technique that has.been previously shown to result in a loss of achievable current over the course of 1000 repeat scans. The 2D-MoS2-SPEs designed, fabricated, and tested herein could have commercial viability as electrocatalytic fuel cell electrodes because of being economical as a result of their scales of economy and inherent tailorability. The technique utilized herein to produce the 2D-MoS2-SPEs could be adapted for the incorporation of different 2D nanomaterials, resulting in SPEs with the inherent advantages identified above.									35	0	0	0	5	0	35			1944-8244			WOS:000405764700047	28573849

It has been the subject of several recent experimental studies with titanium dioxide and titania-based semiconductors as catalysts. The TiO2-mediated photocatalytic NH3 production from H2O and N-2 is a very complex process that is not yet well understood mechanistically, which hampers further advances. In the present work, we address the detailed mechanism of N-2 reduction to NH3 driven by the photolysis of water adsorbed on the rutile TiO2 (110) surface containing oxygen vacancies, by means of reliable density functional calculations (HSE06+D3//PBE+U+D3). We show that each major step of the reaction is driven by H2O photolysis and can proceed under ambient conditions. The initial N-2 adsorption, the activation of the inert N N bond, and the N-N cleavage are all efficiently promoted by TiO2 surface hydroxylation and photogenerated electrons, as well as their synergistic effects, while proton-coupled electron transfers play a decisive role in the N-2 reduction to NH3. These mechanistic insights can probably guide further experimental studies of TiO2 photocatalytic nitrogen fixation and NH3 photosynthesis.									29	3	0	0	1	0	30			2155-5435			WOS:000489204000037		
J	Kichigin, V.I.; Shein, A.B.								Effect of anodising on the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction on cobalt silicides in sulphuric acid solution								Condensed Matter and Interphases				19	3			359	67						2017	2017	The effect of the anodizing of Co2Si and CoSi2 electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 with the potentials of oxide formation Ef from 0.4 up to 2.0 V (standard hydrogen electrode) on the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in 0.5 M H2SO4 at ambient temperature was studied. It has been discovered that the behavior of the anode oxide on cobalt silicides with low and high silicon content significantly differ: the oxide films on Co2Si obtained for all the Ef studied are cathodically reduced, but the oxide films on CoSi2 (close to SiO2) are retained in the cathodic region. Polarization curves were obtained for HER on CoSi2 with the thickness d of the oxide film remaining practically unchanged during the measurements. The rate of HER on CoSi2 decreases by ~ 2.5 orders of magnitude with increasing Ef from 0.5 to 2.0 V. In the intervals 0.5 lesEfles 1.5 V and 1.8 lesEfles 2.0 V the current density of HER, with a constant cathodic potential, decreases exponentially with increasing Ef (and, therefore, with increasing d), and in the Ef region from 1.5 to 1.8 V there is a delay in the change of current density i. The linear dependence of lni on Ef is explained in the framework of the mechanism of direct tunneling of electrons from the conduction band of cobalt disilicide to the unoccupied states of the redox system in the electrolyte. The delay in the change of the HER current at the potentials of formation of the oxide from 1.5 to 1.8 V, which correspond to the beginning of the transpassive region for CoSi2, is explained by the development of an additional tunneling mechanism through the intermediate states, whose role can be played by the oxygen vacancies generated at the silicide/oxide interface upon transition from the passive to the transpassive state. Based on impedance measurements on an anodized CoSi2 electrode in 0.5 M H2SO4, it was concluded that the cathodic hydrogen evolution at sufficiently low electrode potentials occurs via the discharge-recombination mechanism with the limiting discharge step (electron transfer to protonated silanol groups equivSi-OH2+ on the surface of the oxide film).									0	0	1	0	0	0	1			1606-867X			INSPEC:18010808

The formation of interconnected Ag/Ag2MoO4 spheres with an average diameter of 1-2 mu m has been revealed by morphological details. The presence of metallic Ag on the surface of Ag2MoO4 with an average particle size of 0.5-1 nm was confirmed by the apparent resolution of transmission electron microscopic images and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic details. The optical characterization suggested that metallic Ag NPs have an SPR effect. These Ag nanoparticles, when combined with phosphomolybdic acid, increased light absorptivity, resulting in a blueshift in the energy gap. The novel photochemical synthesis method resulted in the disorder-order structure and oxygen vacancies created during preparation for possible suppression of electron-hole recombinations. Under UV-Visible irradiation, the photocatalytic performance of the as-synthesized composite was tested for hydrogen production using ethanol as a sacrificial donor and Pt-as cocatalyst. Metallic Pt deposition on the surface of an Ag/Ag2MoO4 nanocomposite synergistically enhanced electron transport and accelerated proton reduction at an unprecedented rate. Despite the fact that the nanocomposite contains only 0.3% Pt0, the photocatalytic hydrogen production rate reached 0.4 mmol/h/g and remained stable at 0.63 mmol after four cycles of continuous catalytic process.. In 24 h of continuous reaction, total hydrogen evolution of 0.8 mmol was obtained by photocatalytic water splitting reaction with Pt0.3%/Ag/ Ag2MoO4 nanocomposite without ethanol replenishment. The manuscript represents a novel synthesis approach for the development of spherical Ag/Ag2MoO4 nanocomposite imparting significant contribution towards practical application PMA based composite for various photocatalytic applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000810126000006

Value-added formate and hydrogen could be co produced by selective oxidation of methanol without carbon dioxide emissions and water reduction over Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays bifunctional electrocatalysts. Energy depletion for hydrogen evolution from water could be reduced by integrating with selective methanol oxidation rather than oxygen evolution. The prepared Ni(OH)(2) nanosheet arrays exhibits high activity for selective methanol oxidation in alkaline methanol-water solution. It gives a low potential of only 1.36 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) to drive the current density of 100 mA cm(-2). The faradaic efficiencies of formate are approximately 100% with the current densities from 10 mA cm(-2) to 100 mA cm(-2). Moreover, it is easy to separate the anodic and cathodic products without help of any membrane, which greatly simplifies the electrolysis system.									60	1	0	0	4	0	61			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000591342100006

Many oxyfunctionalization reactions catalyzed by UPOs are favored in organic solvents, a milieu in which their enzymatic activity is drastically reduced. Using as departure point the UPO secretion mutant from Agrocybe aegerita (PaDa-I variant), in the current study we have improved its activity in organic solvents by directed evolution. Mutant libraries constructed by random mutagenesis and in vivo DNA shuffling were screened in the presence of increasing concentrations of organic solvents that differed both in regard to their chemical nature and polarity. In addition, a palette of neutral mutations generated by genetic drift that improved activity in organic solvents was evaluated by site directed recombination in vivo. The final UPO variant of this evolutionary campaign carried nine mutations that enhanced its activity in the presence of 30% acetonitrile (vol/vol) up to 23-fold over PaDa-I parental type, and it was also active and stable in aqueous acetone, methanol and dimethyl sulfoxide mixtures. These mutations, which are located at the surface of the protein and in the heme channel, seemingly helped to protect UPO from harmful effects of cosolvents by modifying interactions with surrounding residues and influencing critical loops.									8	0	0	0	6	0	8			0006-3592	1097-0290		WOS:000650287100001	33964174

The as-prepared CoS2 NP/Al2O3 NSs display combined properties of high nanoporosity, thin thickness and good structural stability. When used as an electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the composite demonstrates high catalytic activity, including a small overpotential of similar to 53 mV, a small Tafel slope of 50.9 mV dec(-1) and remarkable stability. Moreover, the CoS2 NP/Al2O3 NSs have a promising lithium-storage capability with high specific capacity (similar to 1150 mA h g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) in the first cycle) and enhanced cycling stability (coulombic efficiency of around 96% for 150 cycles). The facile strategy used to synthesize the unique architecture could be expanded to the preparation of other transition metal sulfides for the HER and lithium ion batteries (LIBs).									39	0	0	0	2	0	39			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395075600052

Two new EPR signals were observed in such samples: a stable and modified S2 multiline signal and an S3 signal [(1989) Biochemistry 28, 8984-8989]. Here, we report what factors are responsible for the modifications of the S2 signal and the observation of the S3 signal. The following results were obtained. (i) The stable, modified, S2 multiline signal can be induced by the addition of high concentrations of EGTA or citrate to PS-II membranes which are already inhibited by Ca2+-depletion. (ii) The carboxylic acids act in the S3-state, are much less effective in S2 and have no effect in the S1-state. (iii) The extrinsic polypeptides (17- and 23-kDa) are not required to observe either the modified S2 signal or the S3 signal. However, they do influence the splitting and the lifetime of the S3 signal, and they seem to have a slight influence on the hyperfine pattern of the S2 signal. (iv) The S3 signal can be observed in Ca2+-depleted PS-II which does not exhibit the modified multiline signal. Then, it is proposed that formation of histidine radical during the S2 to S3 transition in Ca2+-depleted PS-II[(1990) Nature 347, 303-306] also occurs in functional PS-II.									88	1	1	0	65	0	90			0014-5793			WOS:A1990EP60600018	2176622

The prime hurdles for effectively utilizing commercial RuO2 as (OER) electrocatalysts are its very low stability, catalyst deactivation, and high cost. In this work, we explored a Ru-integrated porous organic polymer (Ru@Bpy-POP) by a facile one-pot Friedel Crafts alkylation strategy between redox-active (Ru(demob)(3)Cl-2) and a carbazole unit, which is composed of unique features including an extended framework unit, isolated active sites, and tunable electrode kinetics. Ru@Bpy-POP can serve as a bridge between a Metal Organic Framework (MOF) and POP-based catalytic systems with a balanced combination of covalent bonds (structural stability) and open metal sites (single site catalysis). Ru@Bpy-POP, deposited on a three-dimensional nickel foam electrode support, exhibits a promising electrocatalytic OER activity with an ultra-low ruthenium loading compared to a benchmark RuO2 catalyst, providing an overpotential of about 270 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2) in an alkaline medium. Moreover, a high current density of 248 mA cm(-2) was achieved for the Ru@Bpy-POP catalyst at only 1.6 V (vs. RHE), which is much higher than 91 mA cm(-2) for commercial RuO2. The robust, albeit highly conjugated, POP framework not only triggered facile electro-kinetics but also suppressed aggregation and metallic corrosion during electrolysis. In particular, the benefits of covalent integration of distinct Ru sites into the framework can modulate intermediate adsorption and charge density, which contributes to its exceptional OER activity. All of the critical steps involved in OER are complemented by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which suggest that electrocatalytic water oxidation proceeds from a closed-shell configuration to open-shell electronic configurations with high-spin states. These open-shell configurations are more stable than their closed-shell counter-parts by 1 eV, improving the overall catalytic activity.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000793453300001	35545095

In both symptomatic and asymptomatic leaves of virus-infected plants, photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem II (PSII) was reduced. In all cases analyzed, viral infection affected the polypeptide pattern of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) in thylakoid membranes. The levels of both the 24 and 16 kDa proteins were reduced to a differing extent when compared with the levels in healthy control. This loss of the OEC extrinsic proteins affected the oxygen evolution rates of thylakoid membranes and leaves from infected plants. Additionally, viral coat protein (CP) was found associated with the chloroplasts and the thylakoid membranes of the infected plants. The CP accumulation level was dependent upon both the post-infection time and the virus analyzed, but independent of the CP itself since hybrid viruses did not behave as their parental viruses with the same CP, with respect to PSII inhibition, CP accumulation rates and OEC protein levels. Modulated chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence and oxygen evolution measurements carried out in both types of leaves showed that the quantum yield of PSII electron transport was diminished in infected plants with respect to those of control plants. The decrease in electron transport efficiency was mainly caused by a reduction in the fraction of open reaction centers. The infected plants also showed a reduction in the efficiency of excitation capture in PSII by photoprotective thermal dissipation of excess excitation energy.									141	5	0	0	131	0	148			0031-9317			WOS:000089828700020

Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to environmental changes linked with human activities in river catchments. For instance, the clogging of bottom substratum by fine sediments is observed in many rivers and usually leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in gravel beds. Such hypoxic stress can alter the development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population. Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no population effect in both treatments. We also detected significant sire x treatment interactions in most populations and a tendency for heritability values to be lower under stressful conditions. Overall, these results reveal a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in salmon populations that nevertheless differ in their adaptive potential to hypoxia given the distinct reaction norms observed between and within populations.									13	0	0	0	13	0	14			1010-061X	1420-9101		WOS:000311296500019	23107024

Solar fuels can be effectively produced by the photocatalytic spitting of water into O-2 and H-2 using appropriate catalysts. In this work BiVO4 was evaluated as a candidate material for carrying out the water oxidation or O-2 evolution half reaction, considered as the limiting step for overall water splitting. In particular, the morphology optimization of this material was targeted as a first approach to produce a highly active photocatalyst. Therefore, a series of hydrothermal samples were prepared and different synthesis parameters were investigated (pH and synthesis time), in order to understand the morphology changes and the resultant differences in O-2 production activity. A bubbling reaction system and a recently developed mathematical model were used to estimate more accurately the O-2 production rate versus time in every single test performed. The main outcomes of this work indicate that the synthesis procedure utilized here was effective for the preparation of highly organized leaf-like powders with preferential growth towards the (040) facet when pH 10 and 12 h were used. In addition, we found that crystallite size was the main parameter controlling the O-2 production activity of BiVO4 samples, whereas exposure of (040) was only a secondary parameter. Finally, it was observed that the sacrificial reagent utilized (AgNO3) had a larger impact in the deactivation of samples with a larger exposure of (040) facet (pH 10, 12 h) as compared to the sample without preferential growth (pH 0).

J	Thomas, BC; Li, XQ; Gegenheimer, P				Gegenheimer, Peter Albert/E-2271-2013	Gegenheimer, Peter Albert/0000-0001-9863-1545			Chloroplast ribonuclease P does not utilize the ribozyme-type pre-tRNA cleavage mechanism								RNA				6	4			545	553		10.1017/S1355838200991465				APR 2000	2000	The transfer RNA 5' maturation enzyme RNase P has been characterized in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The purified enzyme from all three kingdoms is a ribonucleoprotein containing an essential RNA subunit; indeed, the RNA subunit of bacterial RNase P RNA is the sole catalytic component. In contrast, the RNase P activity isolated from spinach chloroplasts lacks an RNA component and appears to function as a catalytic protein. Nonetheless, the chloroplast enzyme recognizes a pre-tRNA substrate for E. coli RNase P and cleaves it as efficiently and precisely as does the bacterial enzyme. To ascertain whether there are differences in catalytic mechanism between an all-RNA and an all-protein RNase P, we took advantage of the fact that phosphodiester bond selection and hydrolysis by the E. coli RNase P ribozyme is directed by a Mg2+ ion coordinated to the nonbridging pro-R-P oxygen of the scissile bond, and is blocked by sulfur replacement of this oxygen. We therefore tested the ability of the chloroplast enzyme to process a precursor tRNA containing this sulfur substitution. Partially purified RNase P from spinach chloroplasts can accurately and efficiently process phosphorothioate-substituted pre-tRNAs; cleavage occurs exclusively at the thio-containing scissile bond. The enzymatic throughput is fivefold slower, consistent with a general chemical effect of the phosphorothioate substitution rather than with a metal coordination deficiency. The chloroplast RNase P reaction mechanism therefore does not involve a catalytic Mg2+ bonded to the pro-R-P phosphate oxygen, and hence is distinct from the mechanism of the bacterial ribozyme RNase P.									53	0	1	0	45	0	54			1355-8382	1469-9001		WOS:000086642400009	10786845

To be specific, this included temperature evolution in a coal mass and fluctuating periodic characteristics. The nonlinear gain of coal spontaneous combustion caused by oscillatory heat flux conditions was researched. The results show that the thermal fluctuation at 0.1 Hz is conducive to coal ignition. The ignition delay time (IDT) exponentially decreases with the growth of both the thermal convection velocity and radiation heat flux. Under external thermal disturbance, the temperature, convection velocity, oxygen concentration, and depth of the sensitive area all vary periodically. Under different types of heat disturbance, the temperature and convection velocity fluctuate with an increasing trend, while the oxygen concentration fluctuates with a decreasing trend. There is a low phase difference between the temperature and the convection velocity while the phase difference between the temperature and oxygen concentration is about 90 degrees Besides, the peak fluctuation of the oxidation rate of coal changes inversely with the depth of fluctuations of the sensitive area.

Numerous reports have demonstrated the importance of high donor number (DN) solvents for enhanced ORR, and attributed this phenomenon to the stabilizing interactions between the reduced oxygen species and the solvent molecules. We focus herein on the often overlooked effect of the Li salt used in the electrolyte solution. We show that the level of dissociation of the salt used plays a significant role in the ORR, even as important as the effect of the solvent DN. We clearly show that the salt used dictates the kinetics and thermodynamic of the ORR, and also enables control of the reduced Li2O2 morphology. By optimizing the salt composition, we have managed to demonstrate a superior ORR behavior in diglyme solutions, even when compared to the high DN DMSO solutions. Our work paves the way for optimization of various solvents with reasonable anodic and cathodic stabilities, which have so far been overlooked due to their relatively low DN.									99	1	0	0	6	0	98			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000371453600027	26854802

The fronds lost their pigments. The O-2 evolution was also decreased. The Cr effect was found to be dose dependent. The toxic effects of Cr have further been studied on the photosynthetic activity of Spirodela polyrhiza by means of the chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient O-J-I-P. The Chl a fluorescence transients were recorded in vivo with high time resolution and analyzed according to the JIP-test which can quantify the photosystem II behavior. Cr treated plants show a decrease in yield for primary photochemistry, phi (Po). The performance index of PSII, PIABS, which is the combination of the indexes of three independent parameters, (1) the total number of active reaction centers per absorption (RC/ABS), (2) yield of primary photochemistry (phi (Po)) and (3) efficiency with which a trapped exciton can move an electron into the electron transport chain (psi (0)), decreased due to Cr treatment. Chromate sensitivity varies within plant populations. In summary Cr affects several targets of PSII. More specifically, the main targets of Cr, according to the JIP-test, can be listed as a decrease in the number of active reaction centers and damage to the oxygen-evolving complex.

Herein, we display for the first time that nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon-supported vanadium nitride (VN/NC/C-x) catalysts can be regulated by dicyandiamide (DCDA). The introduction of DCDA not only effectively controls the pore structure, but also plays an important role in adjusting oxygen vacancies and d-electrons. In addition, DCDA is not only a significant raw material for the N-doped carbon, but also a nitrogen source for the preparation of vanadium nitride. The VN/NC/C-3 catalyst was prepared after optimization of the preparation parameters, and the macro/micro structure demonstrates a superior ORR performance in alkaline media with a positive onset potential of 0.85 V and a half-wave potential of 0.75 V, the limiting current density is as high as 4.52 mA center dot cm(-2), and the Tafel slope is only 75.54 mV center dot dec(-1). The VN/NC/C-3-based Zn-air battery exhibits a highest peak power density (161.82 mW center dot cm(-2)) and an excellent energy density (702.28 mAh center dot kg(Zn)(-1) and 861.51 Wh center dot kg(Zn)(-1)). This work provides a valuable synthetic approach for the preparation of other transition metal nitride catalysts with a relative economic value and high performance.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000847080000001

For this, the data of satellite measurements acquired in the first decade of the 21st century were used. The results of the model calculations showed that, in addition to the increase in the spectral flux in the absorption bands of molecular oxygen that leads to the growth of the ozone content, the changes in the flux at longer wavelengths are significant for the composition and temperature of the atmosphere. The changes of the ozone destruction rate in different catalytic cycles partly compensate each other; in these processes, the destruction rate increases in the reaction with atomic oxygen, while it decreases in the hydrogen and chlorine cycles.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0001-4338	1555-628X		WOS:000373860200002

This paper reports a type of S,N co-doped mesoporous carbon hybrids decorated with encapsulated cobalt sulfide nanoparticles (CoxSy/SNC) by a facile method. The hybrid pyrolyzed at 800 degrees C (CoxSy/SNC-800) shows optimal microstructure, and possesses abundant active sites. Additionally, the synergistic effect between the Co(x)S(y )nanoparticles and graphitic-carbon matrices can effectively improve the electrocatalytic activities. Therefore, CoxSy/SNC-800 exhibits a high half-wave potential of 0.80 V towards oxygen reduction, low overpotential of 350 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) towards oxygen evolution, and excellent electrocatalytic stability. The bifunctional oxygen activity is super to the commercial catalysts and comparable with the recent reported electrocatalysts. Moreover, a ZAB with the CoxSy/SNC-800 as air-electrode catalyst displays a peak power density of 136 mW cm(-2), low charge/discharge voltage gap and outstanding cycling stability. Undoubtedly, this finding provides a simple strategy for preparing low-cost bifunctional catalyst in advanced energy conversion and storage devices. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

PCC 7942 treated with either DCMU (a phenylurea PS II inhibitor) or BNT (a phenolic PS II inhibitor). The irradiance response of photoinactivation of PS II oxygen evolution indicated a BNT-specific photoinhibition that saturated at relatively low intensity of light. This BNT-specific process was slowed down under anaerobiosis, was accompanied by the oxygen-dependent formation of a 39 kDa D1 protein adduct, and was not related to stable Q(A) reduction or the ADRY effect. In the BNT-treated cells, the light-induced, oxygen-independent initial drop of PS II electron flow was not affected by formate, an anion modifying properties of the PS II non-heme iron. For DCMU-treated cells, anaerobiosis did not significantly affect PS II photoinactivation, the D1 adduct was not observed and addition of formate induced similar initial decrease of PS II electron flow as in the BNT-treated cells. Our results indicate that reactive oxygen species (most likely singlet oxygen) and modification of the PS II acceptor side are responsible for the fast BNT-induced photoinactivation of PS II.									10	0	0	0	10	2	12			0166-8595	1573-5079		WOS:000087601900003	16228424

Toray Carbon paper, consisting of carbon fibres, exhibited high current density towards water oxidation after repeated cycling in the anodic region. This activity was due to electrochemical surface modification. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that the carbon oxidizes to form oxygen rich functional groups, assisting the water oxidation. The surface was analysed by non- destructive Kelvin probe (work function) and Raman spectroscopy to support the enhanced electrocatalytic activity. Surface charge measurements (Zeta potential) were performed to support the surface oxidation. Obtained Zeta potentials were accounted for the surface carbon oxidation. It was found that increased work function of carbon paper after continual cycling in the anodic region increased the water splitting ability of carbon electrode. Herein, we observed that functional groups existing on carbon electrode after electrochemical oxidation exhibit excellent catalytic activity and may be a promising low cost material for OER.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0947-8396	1432-0630		WOS:000471154000001

Hydrolase stabilization via entanglement in poly(propylene sulfide) nanoparticles: stability towards reactive oxygen species								NANOTECHNOLOGY				23	29					294009	10.1088/0957-4484/23/29/294009				JUL 27 2012	2012	In the advancement of green syntheses and sustainable reactions, enzymatic biocatalysis offers extremely high reaction rates and selectivity that goes far beyond the reach of chemical catalysts; however, these enzymes suffer from typical environmental constraints, e. g. operational temperature, pH and tolerance to oxidative environments. A common hydrolase enzyme, diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase, EC 3.1.8.2), has demonstrated a pronounced efficacy for the hydrolysis of a variety of substrates for potential toxin remediation, but suffers from the aforementioned limitations. As a means to enhance DFPase's stability in oxidative environments, enzymatic covalent immobilization within the polymeric matrix of poly(propylene sulfide) (PPS) nanoparticles was performed. By modifying the enzyme's exposed lysine residues via thiolation, DFPase is utilized as a comonomer/crosslinker in a mild emulsion polymerization. The resultant polymeric polysulfide shell acts as a 'sacrificial barrier' by first oxidizing to polysulfoxides and polysulfones, rendering DFPase in an active state. DFPase-PPS nanoparticles thus retain activity upon exposure to as high as 50 parts per million (ppm) of hypochlorous acid (HOCl), while native DFPase is observed as inactive at 500 parts per billion (ppb). This trend is also confirmed by enzyme-generated (chloroperoxidase (CPO), EC 1.11.1.10) reactive oxygen species (ROS) including both HOCl (3 ppm) and ClO2 (100 ppm).									7	0	0	0	2	0	7			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000305972900010	22743846

NH3 was readily formed at temperatures below 375 degrees C, and the onset of its formation was typically observed coincident with reductant breakthrough. N2O was also observed at these lower test temperatures. The rate of NOx release, as both NO and NO2, increased with increasing temperature due to decreasing nitrate stability. Reduction of NOx necessarily involved the presence of reductant, which was also used to titrate oxygen species from oxygen-storage components such as ceria. Changes in the release of unreduced NO from the catalyst as a function of temperature were directly attributable to the temperature dependencies of nitrate stability and decomposition, NOx diffusion to the precious metal sites, the rate of the NOx reduction reaction and the rate of reduction of these oxygen-storage components. Furthermore, by accounting for the amount of reductant needed for titration of the oxygen-storage components and the amount of NOx trapped, mass balance calculations were performed and used to estimate the amounts of residual nitrates on the catalyst surface after regeneration. These calculations indicate that only at the lower temperatures were the regenerations not effective enough to remove all the trapped NOx. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The nanowires with a CuO phase are found to be the most active, and their degree of crystallinity is important in achieving efficient water oxidation. For the crystalline CuO nanowires in a weakly basic Na2CO3 electrolyte, a Tafel slope of 41 mV/decade, an overpotential of approximately 500 mV at 10 mA/cm(2) (without compensation for the solution resistance), and a faradaic efficiency of nearly 100% are obtained. This electrode maintains a stable current for over 15 h. The low overpotential of 500 mV at -10 mA/cm(2), small Tafel slope, long-term stability, and low cost make CuO one of the most promising catalysts for water oxidation. Moreover, the evolution of the CuO nanowire morphology over time is studied by electron microscopy, revealing that the diffusion of Cu ions from the interior of the nanowires to their surface causes the aggregation of individual nanowires over time. However, despite this aggregation, the current density remains nearly constant, because the total electrochemically active surface area of CuO does not change.									32	1	0	0	1	0	32			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000440733100032

The development of co-catalysts for promoting exciton splitting and charge separation has therefore gained continuous attention. Herein, "Co4O4" cubane complex Co4O4(O2CMe)(4)(PY)(4) (1a, py = pyridine derivatives), serves as a homogeneous molecular co-catalyst which is engineered into the framework of pristine polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) for water oxidation with light illumination. This modification strategy maximizes the contact areas between co-catalysts and reactants, reduces the over-potential of oxygen producing and accelerates the interface transfer rate of electron-hole pairs, thus leading to enhanced reaction kinetics for photocatalytic water oxidation. Compared with pristine PCN, the photocatalytic O-2 production rate up to 19-fold-enhanced in the presence of molecular co-catalyst. This work emphasizes the importance of developing effective, stable and earth-abundant molecular co-catalysts for the promotion of water-splitting photocatalysis.									32	2	0	0	3	0	32			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000443666000069

To tailor fatty acids for desired properties, an engineered P450 monooxygenase has been employed here for enhanced selective hydroxylation of fatty acids. After oxidation of the hydroxy groups to the corresponding ketones, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation could be applied to introduce an oxygen atom into the hydrocarbon chains to form esters, which were finally hydrolyzed to afford either hydroxylated fatty acids or dicarboxylic fatty acids. Using this strategy, we have demonstrated that the high-value-added flavors exaltolide and silvanone supra can be synthesized from stearic acid through a hydroxylation/carbonylation/esterification/hydrolysis/lactonization reaction sequence with isolated yields of about 36 % (for omega-1 hydroxylated stearic acid; 100, 60, 80, 75 % yields for the individual reactions, respectively) or 24 % (for omega-2 hydroxylated stearic acid).

Specimens annealed under Po, and temperature conditions for which the (Bi,Pb)2223 phase itself is stable, based on a critical assessment of the literature, revealed a silver/(Bi,Pb)2223 interface-limited reaction, producing both solid and liquid decomposition phases. The (Bi,Pb)2223 not in direct contact with silver exhibited no reaction under the same conditions. Solid silver dissolves into the (Bi,Pb)2223 incongruent liquid, facilitating the incongruent melting reaction.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising candidate, but its catalytic activity is kinetically retarded in alkaline media due to the unfavorable water adsorption and dissociation feature. A heterogeneous electrocatalyst is reported that is constructed by selenium-doped MoS2 (Se-MoS2) particles on 3D interwoven cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) nanowire arrays that drives the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with fast reaction kinetics in base. The resultant Se-MoS2/CoSe2 hybrid exhibits an outstanding catalytic HER performance with extremely low overpotentials of 30 and 93 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) in base, respectively, which outperforms most of the inexpensive alkaline HER catalysts, and is among the best alkaline catalytic activity reported so far. Moreover, this hybrid catalyst shows exceptional catalytic performance with very low overpotentials of 84 and 95 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic and neutral electrolytes, respectively, implying robust pH universality of this hybrid catalyst. This work may provide new inspirations for the development of high-performance MoS2-based HER electrocatalysts in unfavorable basic media for promising catalytic applications.									53	3	0	0	2	0	52			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000523482400004	32133786

Analysis of intermediates is required to elucidate the reaction paths of reductive O-2 cleavage. An oxidase protein from the bacterium Geobacillus kaustophilus, R2lox, was used for aerobic in-vitro reconstitution with only Fe-57(II) or Mn(II) plus Fe-57(II) ions to yield [FeFe] or [MnFe] cofactors under various oxygen and solvent isotopic conditions including O-16/18 and H/D exchange. Fe-57-specific X-ray scattering techniques were employed to collect nuclear forward scattering (NFS) and nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS) data of the R2lox proteins. NFS revealed Fe/Mn(III)Fe(III) cofactor states and Mossbauer quadrupole splitting energies. Quantum chemical calculations of NRVS spectra assigned molecular structures, vibrational modes, and protonation patterns of the cofactors, featuring a terminal water (H2O) bound at iron or manganese in site 1 and a metal-bridging hydroxide (mu OH-) ligand. A procedure for quantitation and correlation of experimental and computational NRVS difference signals due to isotope labeling was developed. This approach revealed that the protons of the ligands as well as the terminal water at the R2lox cofactors exchange with the bulk solvent whereas O-18 from O-18(2) cleavage is incorporated in the hydroxide bridge. In R2lox, the two water molecules from four-electron O-2 reduction are released in a two-step reaction to the solvent. These results establish combined NRVS and QM/MM for tracking of iron-based oxygen activation in biological and chemical catalysts and clarify the reductive O-2 cleavage route in an enzyme.									1	0	1	0	0	0	1			0005-2728	1879-2650		WOS:000504950800002	31394094

Carboxylate-bridged diiron enzymes including ferritin have the common mechanism of oxygen activation via peroxodiferric intermediates. However, the route for iron uptake and the structural identification of intermediates still remain incomplete. The 4-fold symmetry channel of Helicobacter pylori ferritin was previously proposed as the iron-uptake route in eubacteria, but the amino acid residues at the 4-fold channel are not highly conserved. Here, we show evidence for a short path for iron uptake from His93 on the surface to the ferroxidase center in H. pylori ferritin and Escherichia coli ferritin. The amino acid residues along this path are highly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria and some archaea, and the mutants containing S20A and H93L showed significantly decreased iron oxidation. Surprisingly, the E. coli ferritin S20A crystal structure showed oxygen binding and side-on, symmetric mu-eta(2):eta(2) peroxodiferric and oxodiferric intermediates. The results provide the structural basis for understanding the chemical nature of intermediates in iron oxidation in bacteria and some of archaea. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination of high surface area, aspect ratio, and porosity of electrospun NCO nanofibers (NCO-NF) enhance their electrocatalytic performance by improved electron mobility and more active sites. In the present study, NCO-NF fabricated using poly (styrene-co-acrylonitrile) (SAN) as a sacrificial polymer, were embellished with graphene nanoclusters (GNC), which augment the electrocatalytic performance of the NCO-NF. The in situ formed GNC along the NCO-NF are result of the interaction between the polar functional groups of the polymer, and the cations of precursor salts during the calcination of precursor nanofibers. The GNC/NCO-NF with least crystallite size and high aspect ratio having porous NCO nanoparticles and in situ grown GNC were developed using sol-gel electrospinning process assisted by calcination of precursor nanofibers. This simple, eco-friendly, and economical synthesis route with unique structure chemistry of SAN to form GNC and the presence of dual cations (Ni and Co) provides enhanced performance and multifunctionality to GNC/NCO-NF electrodes for electrocatalytic applications, such as biosensors and water-splitting. In the present study, the modified electrodes (GNC/NCO-NF/graphite electrode) exhibited excellent non-enzymatic glucose detection over a wide range of concentration with a lower limit of 1.2 mu M and sensitivity of 1827.5 mu A mM(-1) mg(-1) in 0.1 M NaOH. Further, the modified electrodes were also tuned for H2O2 detection to aid enzymatic glucose sensing. When examined for bifunctional water-splitting in 1 M NaOH, the electrode reached an onset potential of -0.537 V and 0.735 V against reversible hydrogen reference electrode and a Tafel slope of 37.6 mV.dec(-1) and 67.0 mV.dec(-1) for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The results prove that GNC/NCO-NF are promising candidates as multifunctional electrocatalyst.									11	2	0	0	0	0	11			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000495498100015

However, there have recently been some clinical papers reporting hypersensitivity and allergic reactions to Ti. The purpose of this study was to assess the corrosive properties of Ti in the intra-oral environment in vitro. Cast pure Ti specimens were immersed in artificial saliva, physiological saline solution, and 128 mmol L-1 of lactic, formic and acetic acids for 3 weeks at 37 degreesC with shaking. The colour, weight, surface morphologies and chemical binding state of specimens were observed before and after immersion. Marked discoloration was recognized on the surface of specimens immersed in formic acid, and a significant difference was found between the immersion solutions. Weight changes also varied with solutions; a tendency to increase in formic acid and to decrease in lactic acid. A slight loss was observed in specimens immersed in lactic acid and artificial saliva. The oxide layer composed mainly of Ti-oxide on the surface of the immersed specimens was thinnest in lactic acid, and thickest in formic acid. The present study indicates that both hydrogen evolution type and oxygen diffusion type corrosion on Ti surfaces are possible in the living body. (Our results also confirm some clinical studies reporting Ti accumulation in surrounding tissues and Ti causing allergic reactions.)									34	1	0	0	10	1	34			0305-182X			WOS:000169481600007	11422680

Distribution of manganese species formed in the oxidative dimerization reaction of [Mn-II(terpy)(2)](2+) (terpy = 2,2':6',2 ''-terpyridine) (1') with various oxidants in water was revealed. 1' was stoichiometrically oxidized to form di-mu-oxo dinuclear manganese complex, [(OH2)(terpy)Mn-III(mu-O)(2)Mn-IV(terpy)(OH2)](3+) (1) by KMnO4 as an oxidant. When Oxone and Ce(IV) oxidants were used, the further oxidation of 1 to [(OH2)(terpy)Mn-IV(mu-O)(2)Mn-IV(terpy)(OH2)](4+) (2) was observed after the oxidative dimerization reaction of 1'. The mica adsorbates with various composition of 1', 1 and 2 were prepared by adding mica suspension to the various oxidant-treated solutions followed by filtration. The heterogeneous water oxidation catalysis by the mica adsorbates was examined using a Ce(IV) oxidant. The observed catalytic activity of the mica adsorbates corresponded to a content of 1 (1(ads)) adsorbed on mica for KMnO4- and Oxone-treated systems, indicating that 1' (1'(ads)) and 2 (2(ads)) adsorbed on mica do not work for the catalysis. The kinetic analysis suggested that lads works for the catalysis through cooperation with adjacent lads or 2(ads), meaning that 2(ads) assists the cooperative catalysis by lads though 2(ads) is not able to work for the catalysis alone. For the Ce(IV)-treated system, O-2 evolution was hardly observed although the sufficient amount of 1(ads) was contained in the mica adsorbates. This was explained by the impeded penetration of Ce(IV) ions (as an oxidant for water oxidation) into mica by Ce3+ cations (generated in oxidative dimerization of 1') co-adsorbed with 1(ads).

Recent developments in heavy-ion fusion reactions								REVIEWS OF MODERN PHYSICS				86	1						10.1103/RevModPhys.86.317				MAR 28 2014	2014	In this review the main advances in heavy-ion fusion research that have taken place over the last decade are addressed. During this period, experimental studies have been extended to deep sub-barrier energies to reveal the unexpected phenomenon of fusion hindrance. The coupled-channels descriptions have been refined to include the effects of nucleon transfer and to account for the fusion hindrance in terms of the ion-ion potential in the strongly overlapping region. Substantial progress has been made in time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory to the point that this approach now can make parameter-free predictions of heavy-ion fusion excitation functions. As several heavy-ion fusion reactions are of crucial importance in late-stage giant-star evolution, these reactions continue to be studied with better experimental and theoretical tools in order to provide improved input to astrophysical models. The effects of loosely bound valence nucleons on the fusion cross sections are the focus of a number of experimental studies involving radioactive beams, which have only recently become available. And finally, as the active field of synthesizing superheavy elements relies on heavy-ion fusion to reach the nuclei of interest, it is important to understand the fusion dynamics that plays a crucial role in both the "cold-fusion"and "hot-fusion"approaches to the superheavy island of stability. Also this area has seen significant progress in several different approaches to the problem of predicting the cross sections for formation and survival of these rare nuclei.									357	20	1	0	0	1	368			0034-6861	1539-0756		WOS:000334225600003

In this composite material, WO3-x particles with the size about 10-15 nm disperse evenly in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon matrix. WO3-x@NC presents low overpotentials (eta(10)) of 61 and 306 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for HER and OER in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. With WO3-x@NC as both cathode and anode at the same time, an electrolyzer, WO3-x@NC//WO3-x@NC was constructed for overall water splitting, which only needs a cell voltage of 1.60 V to achieve a current of 10 mA/cm(2). During this process, WO3-x@NC//WO3-x@NC exhibits remarkable stability in 48 h. Moreover, besides HER and OER, WO3-x,@NC also shows striking catalytic activity for reductive conversion of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. Oxygen vacancies from WO3-x and good electron transportation property of nitrogen doped carbon matrix play important roles in overall water electrocatalytic splitting and 4-nitrophenol reductive removal. We expect WO3-x@NC will find its way as a new resource for hydrogen energy as well as a promising material in 4-nitrophenol removal from water.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1293-2558	1873-3085		WOS:000441881100004

The effects of electro-activity (i.e., electron-withdrawing ability of BPDA, 6FDA and FeDATPP when these units were binding with DO) and the roles of the nanofiber orientation in DO sensing were investigated. Electrochemical characterization indicates that the current values in Cyclic Voltammograms (CV) exhibits linear correlation with the DO concentration, with the correlation coefficient R2 varying from 0.9461 to 0.9958, suggesting the excellent DO sensing performance of the synthesized porphyrinated polyimides. Meanwhile, it is found that the oxygen reduction behaviors in DO sensing were vastly altered due to the different electro-activity and orientation structures of the porphyrinated polyimides nanofibers. An unusual side-on porphyrin-O2 configuration and charge transfer mechanism during DO sensing were clarified upon molecular simulation. The present work provides two novel porphyrinated polyimides for DO sensor applications.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			0143-7208	1873-3743		WOS:000449241200009

Platinum-based catalysts are the most efficient to catalyze and convert water into molecular hydrogen; however, their large-scale application is prevented by scarcity and cost of Pt. In this work, we propose a new ternary composite of Ag2S, MoS2, and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) flakes via a one-pot synthesis. The RGO support assists the growth of two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets partially covered by silver sulfides as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Compared with the bare MoS2 and MoS2/RGO, the Ag2S/MoS2 anchored on the RGO surface (the ternary system Ag2S/MoS2/RGO) demonstrated a high catalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Its superior electrochemical activity toward HER is evidenced by the positively shifted (-190 mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) overpotential at a current density of -10 mA/cm(2) and a small Tafel slope (56 mV/dec) compared with a bare and binary system. The Ag2S/MoS2/RGO ternary catalyst at an overpotential of -200 mV demonstrated a turnover frequency equal to 0.38 s(-1). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was applied to understand the charge-transfer resistance; the ternary sample shows a very small charge transfer resistance (98 Omega) at -155 mV vs RHE. Such a large improvement can be attributed to the synergistic effect resulting from the enhanced active site density of both sulfides and to the improved electrical conductivity at the interfaces between MoS2 and Ag2S. This ternary catalyst opens up further optimization strategies to design a stable and cheap catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction, which holds great promise for the development of a clean energy landscape.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000473251100036	31145582

VOn (nges3) defects in irradiated and heat-treated silicon								Diffusion and Defect Data Part B (Solid State Phenomena)				108-109				267	72						2005	2005	Local vibrational mode (LVM) spectroscopy has been used to study the evolution of vacancy-oxygen-related defects (VOn) in the temperature range 300-700degC in carbon-lean Cz-Si samples irradiated with MeV electrons or neutrons. New experimental data confirming an attribution of the absorption bands at 910, 976 and 1105 cm-1 to the VO3 complex are obtained. In particular, a correlated generation of VO3 and the oxygen trimer is observed upon irradiation of Cz Si crystals in the temperature range 300-400degC. Strong evidence for the assignment of the bands at 991 and 1014 cm-1 to a VO4 defect is presented. The lines are found to develop very efficiently in the VO2 containing materials enriched with the oxygen dimer. In such materials the formation of VO4 is enhanced due to occurrence of the reaction O2i+ VO2 rArr VO4. Annealing of the VO3 and VO4 defects at T ges 550degC is found to result in the appearance of new defects giving rise to a number of O-related LVM bands in the range 990-1110 cm-1. These bands are suggested to arise from VO5 and/or VO6 defects. Similar bands also appear upon the annihilation of oxygen-related thermal double donors at 650degC in Cz-Si crystals pre-annealed at 450degC.									0	0	0		0	0	0			1012-0394			INSPEC:8691586

The chemical behaviors of this system were investigated under an ultrahigh temperature that can be induced by a high-energy density laser and compared to those at high temperature. According to some experimental data, we assume that an ultrahigh temperature can be used to mimic laser irradiation. The conclusions of this simulation are as follows. First, the ReaxFF MD simulations showed that the decomposition rates of benzene were significantly accelerated by laser irradiation or in the presence of oxygen. Second, additional initiation pathways were opened up by these two factors. The primary initiation pathway involves only the hydrogen atom loss in the pyrolysis of benzene at 3000 K, and the initiation pathways become much more complicated after laser irradiation or the involvement of oxygen. Third, the ReaxFF MD simulations formed a reasonable carbon black (CB) texture of various sizes in the pyrolysis of benzene, and we also focused on the evolution of the texture of CB. The calculation results of the final gaseous products, hydrocarbons, and the formation of CB are in a good agreement with the literature.

Photocatalysts can in fact be used in hydrogen (H-2) production (e.g., via water splitting or photo-reforming of organic substrates), CO2 reduction, pollution mitigation and water or air remediation via oxidation (photodegradation) of pollutants. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a "benchmark" photocatalyst, thanks to many favorable characteristics. We here review the basic knowledge on the charge carrier processes that define the optical and photophysical properties of intrinsic TiO2. We describe the main characteristics and advantages of TiO2 as photocatalyst, followed by a summary of historical facts about its application. Next, the dynamics of photogenerated electrons and holes is reviewed, including energy levels and trapping states, charge separation and charge recombination. A section on optical absorption and optical properties follows, including a discussion on TiO2 photoluminescence and on the effect of molecular oxygen (O-2) on radiative recombination. We next summarize the elementary photocatalytic processes in aqueous solution, including the photogeneration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the hydrogen evolution reaction. We pinpoint the TiO2 limitations and possible ways to overcome them by discussing some of the "hottest" research trends toward solar hydrogen production, which are classified in two categories: (1) approaches based on the use of engineered TiO2 without any cocatalysts. Discussed topics are highly-reduced "black TiO2", grey and colored TiO2, surface-engineered anatase nanocrystals; (2) strategies based on heterojunction photocatalysts, where TiO2 is electronically coupled with a different material acting as cocatalyst or as sensitizer. Examples discussed include TiO2 composites or heterostructures with metals (e.g., Pt-TiO2, Au-TiO2), with other metal oxides (e.g., Cu2O, NiO, etc.), direct Z-scheme heterojunctions with g-C3N4 (graphitic carbon nitride) and dye-sensitized TiO2.									46	1	0	0	5	0	46				1996-1944		WOS:000638711900001	33801646

Practically, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for HER in alkaline media is of great importance for the conversion of renewable energy to hydrogen fuel via photoelectrochemical water splitting. However, both mechanistic exploration and materials development for HER under alkaline conditions are very limited. Precious. Pt metal, which still serves as the state-of-the-art catalyst for HER, is unable to guarantee a sustainable hydrogen supply. Here we report an anomalously structured Ru catalyst that shows 2.5 times higher hydrogen generation rate than Pt and is among the most active HER electrocatalysts yet reported in alkaline solutions. The identification of new face-centered cubic crystallographic structure of Ru nanoparticles was investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging, and its formation mechanism was revealed by spectroscopic characterization and theoretical analysis. For the first time, it is found that the Ru nano catalyst showed a pronounced effect of the crystal structure on the electrocatalytic activity tested under different conditions. The combination of electrochemical reaction rate measurements and density functional theory computation shows that the high activity of anomalous Ru catalyst in alkaline solution originates from its suitable adsorption energies to some key reaction intermediates and reaction kinetics in the HER process.									613	30	0	0	36	0	614			0002-7863			WOS:000389962800057	27960327

While iron nitrogen carbon materials pyrolytically prepared from ZIF-8, a specific zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with sodalite topology, have shown enhanced activities toward oxygen reduction in acidic electrolyte, the rational design of sacrificial metal organic frameworks toward this application has hitherto remained elusive. Here, we report for the first time that the oxygen reduction activity of Fe-N-C catalysts positively correlates with the cavity size and mass specific pore volume in pristine ZIFs. The high activity of Fe-N-C materials prepared from ZIF-8 could be rationalized, and another ZIF structure leading to even higher activity was identified. In contrast, the ORR. activity is mostly unaffected by the ligand chemistry in pristine ZIFs. These structure property relationships will help identifying novel sacrificial ZIF or porous metal organic frameworks leading to even more active Fe-N-C catalysts. The findings are of great interest for a broader application of the class of inexpensive metal-nitrogen carbon catalysts that have shown promising activity also for the hydrogen evolution (Co-N-C) and carbon dioxide reduction (Fe-N-C and Mn-N-C).									136	9	0	0	7	0	137			0002-7863			WOS:000392036900064	27936673

In this work, novel nanoneedle-like rGO/V-NaxMnO2/CC cathode material with oxygen vacancies has been prepared, where rGO and CC represent reduced graphene oxide and carbon cloth, respectively. By using surface-protection strategy and introduction of abundant oxygen vacancies, high capacitance of rGO/V-NaxMnO2/CC is obtained with 362.5 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1). After the current density increases to 24 A g(-1), the capacitance retention is 56.56%, presenting excellent rate performance. In addition, after 10,000 charge discharge cycles at 5 A g(-1), the capacitance retention rate is 90.17%, showing excellent cycle stability. The aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) of ACMK-3 // rGO/V-NaxMnO2/CC has a wide potential window of 0 similar to 2.5 V. And the energy density is as high as 72.2 Wh kg(-1) at 1254 W kg(-1). After 10,000 charge-discharge cycles at 4 A g(-1), the ASC still remains a capacitance retention rate of 88.5%. This work provides a facial method to improve electrochemical properties and shed a light on fabricating a novel cathode for aqueous supercapacitors. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show for the first time that suspended microcrystals CuWO4 evolve oxygen photocatalytically under visible illumination from solutions of 0.05 M AgNO3 (10.8 mu mol/hour; AQE of 0.56% at 400 nm) and 0.0002 M FeCl3 (1.5 mu mol/hour). No oxygen is detected with 0.002 M [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) as sacrificial agent. The activity dependence on the redox potential of the acceptors is due to the presence of Cu2+ based electron trap states in CuWO4. According to surface photovoltage spectroscopy and electrochemistry, these states are located on the particle surface, 1.8 eV above the valence band edge of the material. Controlling the chemistry of these states will be key to uses of CuWO4 particles in tandem catalysts for overall water splitting. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

The ultrathin Bi nanofilms with 3D structures were synthesized using a safe approach of non-combustion explosion in H2O/DMF solution at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The violent reaction between H2O2 and NH3 H2O resulted in a non-combustion explosion due to the fast evolution of gases. Then under high temperature and high pressure during solvothermal process, the further slight explosion occurred where the oxygen-containing molecules of H2O2 and NO3- acted as oxidants, while the hydrogen-containing molecules of NaBH4, NH3 H2O and DMF acted as reductants. The release of gases was accompanied with Bi-III reduction by NaBH4. The 3D structure of ultrathin Bi nanofilms with many void spaces formed due to the explosive force and foams from the sharp liberation of gases. Such ultrathin Bi nanofilms with 3D structure exhibited outstanding catalytic activity for p-nitrophenol hydrogenation which is important to treat the environmental pollution from p-nitrophenol discharge. Within only several seconds p-nitrophenol hydrogenation was completed without delay. The non-combustion explosion exhibits potential applications for the synthesis of 3D ultrathin film materials as high efficient catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000520193000001	31891926

However, the reactions of both are water based and thus, it is extremely challenging to conduct both processes on one catalyst. Herein, a function-switchable metal-free catalyst was designed and synthesized through the polycondensation of procyanidin and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde. Impressively, the catalyst developed here not only split water to produce hydrogenviaa four-electron reaction process in the absence of air, but also generated hydrogen peroxide by preferentially reducing oxygenviaa two-electron pathway in air. The production rates of hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide reached 252.02 and 1385.42 mu mol h(-1)g(-1), respectively. Throughin situtransient photovoltage tests and kinetic analysis, a clear and fundamental understanding of the highly efficient and switchable functions was acquired for this photocatalyst. This study highlights the unique behavior and provides an insight into the design of function-switchable catalysts and the regulation of catalytic reactions.									23	1	0	0	6	0	23			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000542761900029		
J	Li, Changhao; Shen, Ping; Pan, Hongdi								Mineralogy of the Aktogai giant porphyry Cu deposit in Kazakhstan: Insights into the fluid composition and oxygen fugacity evolution								ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS				95				899	916		10.1016/j.oregeorev.2018.03.027				APR 2018	2018	It has been proposed that most giant porphyry Cu deposits are closely associated with oxidized magmas. Most recently, many methods, including zircon trace elements, Mn content in apatite and magnetite-ilmenite mineral pair, were used to reveal the primary magmatic oxygen fugacity of the porphyry Cu deposits. Hydrothermal alterations are products of water-rock reactions and can form various hydrothermal minerals which can be used for exploration. The Aktogai Group, including Aktogai, Aidarly and Kyzilkia, contains more than 12.5 Mt Cu @ 0.4 wt% and 80 t Au @ 0.007 g/t-0.4 g/t. Chlorites show significant variations in the Aktogai deposit, which are responsible for degrees of Tschermak and Di-trioctahedral substitution. Chlorites are divided into type I and II based on Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios of chlorites which are predominately controlled by hydrothermal fluid composition and oxygen fugacity. The chlorite I have higher Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios than chlorite II. The formation temperatures of chlorite are 248-322 degrees C based on empirical geothermometry T5. Sericites belong to muscovite and phengitic muscovite, and their compositions are controlled by Tschermak and Fe3+VI = Al3+VI substitution. Water-rock reaction leaches out some elements into hydrothermal fluids, therein Si4+ and K+ precipitate as quartz and sericite at all alteration stages, but Fe2+ and Ca2+ precipitate as specific minerals (such as chalcopyrite and calcite) at main mineralization or late stage. The chlorite I form under a Fe-rich condition with high water/rock ratio, while chlorite II form under a low water/rock ratio and Fe-poor condition which may be responsible for the sulfides and epidote precipitation. According to zircon trace elements, Mn content in apatite, magnetite-ilmenite mineral pair, and Fe/(Fe + Mg) and Fe3+/TFe ratios of chlorites, the oxygen fugacity changes from high at magmatic and early hydrothermal stages, through low at main mineralization stage, to slightly high at late or post mineralization stage. Our results, combined with previous works suggest that Fe contents and Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratios of chlorites are good indicators for exploration.									7	1	0	0	0	0	7			0169-1368	1872-7360		WOS:000432760500049

In alloys containing oxygen contents lower than 1.2 at. %, alloys display massive gamma(m) structure regions and regions having a two-phase (alpha(2) + gamma) ultrafine lamellar structure. gamma(m) regions contain very thin alpha(2) plates. These plates are formed according a gamma --> alpha(2) transformation involved in gamma(m) regions after the alpha --> gamma(m) massive transformation. alpha(2) precipitation in gamma(m) lowers both Ti and O concentrations in the gamma(m) structure. Ti and O in excess within gamma(m) are hence found to favour alpha(2) precipitation. Within ultrafine lamellar structure regions, oxygen is concentrated in alpha(2) lamellae and is found to be responsible for the high volume fraction of alpha(2)-phase. Above a critical oxygen content (similar to1.2 at. %), the alloy exhibit a fully (alpha(2) + gamma) ultrafine lamellar structure. Analysis of the classical lamellar structure formed within the (alpha + gamma) dual-phase field shows that the To line for the alpha --> alpha(2) chemical ordering reaction is shifted towards high temperature when oxygen content is increased. It has therefore been inferred that, above 1.2 at. % the alpha --> gamma(m) massive transformation is suppressed and replaced by the alpha --> alpha(2) --> alpha + gamma transformation paths. On the basis of these new results, hypotheses have been proposed to explain the divergences between former results, concerning the shape of the alpha(2) single phase field and the composition dependence of the alpha --> gamma(m) massive transformation.

We investigated in detail the electrochemical oxidation of SrFeO2.5 to SrFeO3 on a spherical single crystal of 70 mu m diameter by in situ diffraction at an ambient temperature. Complete data sets were obtained by scanning the whole reciprocal space using a 2M Pilatus detector, resulting in 3600 frames with a resolution of 0.1 degrees per data set, each obtained in 18 min. The crystal was mounted in a specially designed electrochemical cell with 1N KOH used as the electrolyte. During the electrochemical oxidation, the reaction proceeds following the phase sequence SrFeO2.5/SrFeO2.75/SrFeO2.875/SrFeO3, structurally accompanied by establishing a complex series of long-range oxygen vacancy ordering, which gets instantly organized at ambient temperature. The topotactic reaction pathway is discussed in terms of the evolution of the twin domain structure. The formation of SrFeO2.875 is accompanied by the formation of diffuse streaks along the [1 0 0]-direction of the perovskite cell, reaching high d-spacings. The diffuse streaks are discussed and are thought to originate from a modified twin structure induced by the SrFeO2.75 to SrFeO2.875 transition, and the associated changes in the domain structure, developed during the oxygen intercalation. We equally analysed and discussed in detail the twin structure of all the title compounds. We confirm the ground state of SrFeO2.5 is able to adopt the Imma space group symmetry, showing stacking faults of the tetrahedral layers along the stacking axis of the brownmillerite unit cell, indicated by the 1D diffuse rods. We showed that in situ single crystal diffraction has huge potential in the study of non-stoichiometric compounds under operando conditions, in order to obtain structural information i.e. about diffuse scattering, and microstructural information related to domain effects such as twinning-information far beyond that which powder diffraction methods allow us to obtain.									23	0	1	0	0	0	25			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000368443100006

In addition, higher-indexed beta-alumina species beta''' and beta(IV), which show a relation to beta- and beta''-alumina respectively, can also be prepared. Alumina precursors exhibiting a cubic-close-packed (gamma) oxygen sublattice, lead to the direct formation of the beta''-alumina family, whereas precursors with a hexagonal-close-packed oxygen ion array (alpha) form beta-alumina. K-beta''-alumina forms between 1100 and 1200 degrees C. Ternary K-beta''-alumina is stable until it decomposes into spinel, corundum and K2O vapor at 1900 degrees C.									10	1	0	0	0	0	11			0167-2738			WOS:A1995TB25500006

The effect of O/F molar ratio on the oxygen defect and photochemical property are mainly investigated. It is found that BiO0.51F1.98, BiO0.67F1.66, Bi7O5F11 and BiF3 can form in acetic acid/water (AA/W) medium; whereas in tetrahydrofuran/water (THF/W) medium, BiF3 and BiOF can only form. Moreover, with decreasing O/F ratio, the energy band of BixOyFz down shifts and the band gap becomes wider; but the amount of oxygen defect decreases with decreasing O/F ratio, namely, Bi7O5F11 (O/F = 0.4545, g = 307 mT) > BiO0.67F1.66 (O/F = 0.4036, g = 260 mT) > BiO0.51F1.98 (O/F = 0.2576, g = 130 mT).

In this work, novel carbon and nitrogen self-doped TiO2 hollow spheres (CNTH) with oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ were synthesized by a one-pot hydrothermal strategy in H2O-C2H5OH-HF-H2O2 mixed solution with TiCN as a precursor of anatase TiO2 and self-doping source of N and C. The presence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ in the resulting CNTH photocatalyst was supported by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the C and N atoms were successfully self-doped into TiO2 lattice, which resulted in the CNTH materials exhibiting the enhanced absorption in the UV-visible region with a clear red shift at the absorption edges. The electronic structure of CNTH was examined by first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which further confirmed the optical properties of CNTH for the enhanced visible-light absorption properties and the red-shift phenomenon of the absorption edges. The resulting CNTH photocatalyst showed enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity for H-2 production. The enhanced activity of CNTH was due to the introduction of C and N self-doping and the existence of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+. The former can promote the photocatalytic reactions of the photogeneration electrons and holes on CNTH under visible-light irradiation, while the latter create more active sites and prolong the life time of electrons and holes by their donor states.

J	Li, Mengting; Zheng, Xingqun; Li, Li; Wei, Zidong								Research Progress of Hydrogen Oxidation and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Mechanism in Alkaline Media								ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA				37	9					2007054	10.3866/PKU.WHXB202007054				SEP 15 2021	2021	Hydrogen oxygen fuel cells and water electrolysis serves as two important systems for realizing the recycling of hydrogen energy, which involves two crucial electrochemical reactions, the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The kinetics of HOR/HER in alkaline media is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude slower than that in acidic media, which is the main bottleneck that hinders the development of alkaline membrane fuel cells and alkaline water electrolysis. Thus, clarifying the underlying difference of HOR/HER activity in alkaline and acid electrolytes, and exploring the alkaline HOR/HER mechanism are the significant challenges for widely commercial application of low temperature alkaline energy conversion devices. Here, this paper briefly reviews the related explanations and controversies about the alkaline HOR/HER mechanism in recent years, including bifunctional mechanism, hydrogen binding energy (HBE) theory and electronic effect. The bifunctional mechanism emphasizes the influence of water dissociation and OH adsorption on HER and HOR, respectively, which possesses guiding significance for designing and fabricating composite catalysts. The HBE theory stresses that Had is the key reaction intermediate of HOR/HER, and other external factors, such as electrode potential, pH, ions and so on, affect the HOR/HER mechanism and kinetics by disturbing HBE. HBE is widely considered to be the only activity descriptor of HOR/HER. The electronic effect emphasizes the role of catalysts' composition and reaction intermediates in regulating electronic structure of active sites and changing HOR/HER mechanism. It provides an effective strategy to construct active sites and optimize catalytic activity. In addition, we summarize the theoretical simulation methods of electrochemical interface and their applications in exploring HOR/HER mechanism. In-depth theoretical simulation of HOR/HER mechanism requires the establishment of a more reasonable explicit solvation model on electrode/electrolyte interface and the combination of density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and microkinetic model, to calculate the electronic structure and the dynamic processes of electrode/electrolyte interface, such as bond breaking and formation, solvent recombination, and proton migration in the electric double layer during reaction process, and then to analyze the HOR/HER mechanism and reaction kinetics under different electrode potentials and electrolytes. The present review is helpful for understanding the ongoing developments of HOR/HER mechanism. And the combination of experiment and theoretical calculation can be employed to explore the pH-dependence of HOR/HER deeply, and design novel HOR/HER catalysts with high activity and stability.									15	3	0	0	1	0	14			1000-6818			WOS:000614110200015

A model of the enzyme active site was built by starting from the enzyme X-ray structure, and by testing different subsystems comprising different sets of aminoacyl residues. In this process, the stability of the enzyme-substrate complex was taken as a measure of the accuracy of the model. The activated transfer of the amino acid a-hydrogen from the substrate to the flavin N5 position was then induced by constraining a suitable transfer reaction coordinate, and the free energy profile of the reaction was calculated. The evolution of electronic and structural properties of both enzyme-bound substrate and flavin cofactor along the reaction path is consistent with a hydride-transfer mechanism. The calculated free energy barrier for this process (13 kcal/mol) is in excellent agreement with the activation energy value derived from the experimentally determined rate constant for the corresponding enzyme-catalyzed reaction. The electronic distribution of the reduced flavin shows that the transferred electrons tend to be centered near the C4a position rather than delocalized over the flavin pyrimidine ring. This feature is mechanistically relevant in that such an electronic distribution may promote the subsequent enzyme-catalyzed reduction of molecular oxygen to yield hydrogen peroxide via a postulated flavin 4a-peroxide intermediate. These results also show that a first-principles molecular dynamics approach is suitable to study the mechanism of complex enzymatic processes, provided that a smaller, yet reliable, subsystem of the enzyme can be identified, and special computational techniques are employed to enhance the sampling of the reactive event.									27	0	0	0	15	0	27			0006-2960			WOS:000179517000004	12450374

At present, how to make efficient catalysts with superior catalytic activity from cheap raw materials in large scale remains a great challenge. Here, we report a new nickel phosphide-based hybrid nanosheet arrays electrocatalyst, synthesized by a one-step phosphorization of commercial nickel (Ni) foam, for hydrogen evolution in water splitting. In acidic medium, the nickel phosphide nanosheet arrays exhibit very stable and fast hydrogen evolution kinetics with a relatively low overpotentials of 61mV and 121mV to achieve current densities of -10 and -100mA cm(-2), respectively, with a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1), showing comparable performance to the most efficient non-noble metal based hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts reported so far. This robust electrocatalyst, made from commercially available materials, holds a potential for the industrialization of clean hydrogen energy. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

When doped with late transition metals, the redox reactions ensuring the charge compensation upon Na+ removal can rely on the direct participation of anionic chemistry, with encouraging outcomes in terms of both energy density and power. However, the control of reversible O2-/O- reactions is still a major issue, as the undesired release of O2 can lead to detrimental effects on cathode capacity and overall cell stability. The fine-tuning of metal-oxygen bond covalency has recently emerged as a promising strategy toward the reversible access of oxygen redox. Following the route paved by Ru-based Li-rich cathode materials, we hereby present a first-principles investigation of a Ru-doped NaxTMO2 (TM = Ru, Ni, and Mn) system and the related structural and electronic properties of interest for NIB applications. We aim to dissect the specific role of each element sublattice in compensating the electronic charge along desodiation, with a major focus on the anionic contribution. The oxygen activity is addressed in the high-voltage range (i.e.,xNa = 0.25), and the underlying mechanism is derived from PBE + U(-D3BJ) calculations. We also discuss the effects of Mn deficiency as a suitable site for the formation of low-energy superoxide species via preferential breaking of the Ni-O bond. Conversely, breaking a Ru-O bond is unlikely to occur, which assesses the key role of the Ru dopant in stabilizing the oxide lattice and enabling the desired reversible conditions. Our results also highlight the oxygen vacancy formation energy as an effective descriptor for different activities toward the O2-/O-/O2 evolution. All these theoretical insights can be useful to drive further experimental efforts toward the optimal design of efficient and high-energy NIB cathodes with enhanced practical reversible capacity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2574-0962			WOS:000851412400001

It is a great challenge and long-standing issue to reveal the synthesizing mechanism of this Mn4CaO5 cluster in both natural and artificial photosynthesis. Herein, efforts were made to reveal the synthesizing mechanism of an artificial Mn4CaO4 cluster, a close mimic of the OEC. Four key intermediates were successfully isolated and structurally characterized for the first time. It was demonstrated that the Mn4CaO4 cluster could be formed through a reaction between a thermodynamically stable Mn3CaO4 cluster and an unusual four-coordinated Mn-III ion, followed by stabilization process through binding an organic base (e.g., pyridine) on the "dangling" Mn ion. These findings shed new light on the synthesizing mechanism of the OEC and rational design of new artificial water-splitting catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1864-5631	1864-564X		WOS:000753688600001	35075776

One of the difficulties for recovery is the recycling cost high and restricting the economic drivers. In this research, a process is developed to directly reuse nickel-manganese-cobalt oxides from spent lithium ion batteries to prepare air electrodes based on a simple thermal treatment method. 100% value metals (cobalt, nickel and manganese) were regenerated from the cathode. By heated at 600 degrees C, the Ni-Co-Mn oxides experienced a significant phase change from an alpha-NaFeO2-type structure to spinel structure. Electrochemical tests revealed that the regenerated nickel-manganese-cobalt oxides exhibited remarkable bifunctional catalytic activities towards the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions in aqueous KOH electrolyte. The nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide powders were applied in an air battery, the energy efficiency was 75% at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which was better than commercal zinc-air batteries.									28	8	0	0	9	0	35			0921-3449	1879-0658		WOS:000419417300015

Here, by using earth-abundant corncob (CC) as the carbon source, Co(OH)(2), NaH2PO4, and melamine as the precursors, and KOH as the chemical activator, CoNP@bio-C-a is obtained and comparative studies are carried out with three other types of CC-derived carbon-based catalytic materials, namely, bio-C, CoP@bio-C, and CoNP@bio-C. Depending mainly on the formation of Co2O3/Co2N0.67 active sites (as p-n heterojunctions) and N, P, O-containing functional groups, the resultant CoNP@bio-C-a catalyst exhibits best electrocatalytic activity among the four types of catalysts; via a 4-electron pathway, it has good stability and good methanol tolerance. In addition, its unique honeycomb-like porous structure, high graphitization degree, and abundant oxygen-containing groups contribute to its excellent ORR activity. This study provides insights for exploring the application of heteroatom-doped biomass-derived carbon catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2046-2069		WOS:000731780400001	35424525

It was demonstrated that the TM atoms can remain stable in the cavity of g-C3N4 and interact with the substrate via charge transfer from the TM atoms to g-C3N4. Among all the TM/g-C3N4 samples, Pd/g-C3N4 stands out with a low overpotential of 0.46 V, showing good performance for ORR; thus, it has great potential to replace the noble Pt catalyst. The ORR activity of TM/g-C3N4 is a function of Delta E-*OH (an energy descriptor). Furthermore, the d-band center and ICOHP (electronic structure descriptors) can quantitatively describe the variation trend of Delta E-*OH in addition to Bader charge analysis (a charge transfer descriptor). Considering the number of d orbital electrons and the electronegativity of TM, phi (an intrinsic descriptor) can be applied to predict and reveal the origin of the ORR activity. A bridge from intrinsic characteristics to electronic structures, to charge transfer, to electronic structures and then to adsorption energy has been established, which is conducive to better reveal the ORR activity origin and provide guidance for designing effective ORR electrocatalysts.									68	0	0	0	2	0	68			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000526953200010

Among them, transition metal nitrides (TMNs) are suitable for a wide range of devices because they have better electrical conductivity than the oxides and excellent catalytic properties. In particular, properly designed nanostructured TMNs offer additional advantages for performance enhancement. However, reviews of the rapid utilization of metal nitrides as electrode materials are still not much. In this mini-review, we present a recent (mostly since 2015) update on nanostructured TMNs as high-performance electrode materials for energy storage devices and water splitting; we discussed how a judicious nanostructure design will lead to improving performance in lithium ion battery, supercapacitor and Li-ion capacitor, as well as in electrochemical water splitting (oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions). Knowledge about this review on metal nitrides is aimed at sharing a wide view in recent TMNs synthetic development, applications, prospects and challenges.									248	7	0	0	10	1	250			1369-7021	1873-4103		WOS:000414598800014

In this study, we report an in situ multiple heteroelement (sodium, oxygen, and iodide) doping strategy based on a molten salt-assisted route to prepare a green-colored carbon nitride (GCN). The as-prepared GCN yields 25.5 times higher H-2 evolution rate than that of bulk polymeric carbon nitride under visible light. Experimental characterization data demonstrate that the GCN delivers upshift of the conduction band and increased specific surface area and hydrophilicity. As confirmed by time-resolved PL spectra, DMPO spin-trapping EPR analysis, and so on, the excellent activity is dominantly ascribed to the greatly enhanced hydrophilicity and, subsequently, efficient interfacial charge transfer and hydrogen liberation. Moreover, through surface charge modification, the GCN also shows an increased degradation activity of rhodamine B. This work highlights the importance of surface modulation through multiple earth abundant element incorporation for designing of advanced and practical photocatalysts.									30	1	0	0	2	0	30			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000473251100021	31148445

Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has four genes encoding the FDPs. Flv1 and Flv3 function as an NAD(P) H: oxygen oxidoreductase, donating electrons directly to O-2 without production of reactive oxygen species. Here we show that the Flv1 and Flv3 proteins are crucial for cyanobacteria under fluctuating light, a typical light condition in aquatic environments. Under constant-light conditions, regardless of light intensity, the Flv1 and Flv3 proteins are dispensable. In contrast, under fluctuating light conditions, the growth and photosynthesis of the Delta flv1(A) and/or Delta flv3(A) mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 become arrested, resulting in cell death in the most severe cases. This reaction is mainly caused by malfunction of photosystem I and oxidative damage induced by reactive oxygen species generated during abrupt short-term increases in light intensity. Unlike higher plants that lack the FDPs and use the Proton Gradient Regulation 5 to safeguard photosystem I, the cyanobacterial homolog of Proton Gradient Regulation 5 is shown not to be crucial for growth under fluctuating light. Instead, the unique Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer maintains the redox balance of the electron transfer chain in cyanobacteria and provides protection for photosystem I under fluctuating growth light. Evolution of unique cyanobacterial FDPs is discussed as a prerequisite for the development of oxygenic photosynthesis.									212	4	0	0	191	0	213			0027-8424			WOS:000316377400089	23431195

This trend is thought to arise via pollution of the cluster interstellar medium from a previous generation of stars. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars undergoing hot bottom burning (HBB) are a prime candidate for producing sodium-rich oxygen-poor material, and then expelling this material via strong stellar winds. The amount of Na-23 produced in this environment has been shown to be sensitive to uncertainties in the Ne-22(p, gamma)Na-23 reaction rate. The Ne-22(p, gamma)Na-23 reaction is also activated in classical nova nucleosynthesis, strongly influencing predicted isotopic abundance ratios in the Na-Al region. Therefore, improved nuclear physics uncertainties for this reaction rate are of critical importance for the identification and classification of pre-solar grains produced by classical novae.Purpose: At temperatures relevant for both HBB in AGB stars and classical nova nucleosynthesis, the Ne-22(p, gamma)Na-23 reaction rate is dominated by narrow resonances, with additional contribution from direct capture. This study presents new strength values for seven resonances, as well as a study of direct capture.Method: The experiment was performed in inverse kinematics by impinging an intense isotopically pure beam of Ne-22 onto a windowless H-2 gas target. The Na-23 recoils and prompt y rays were detected in coincidence using a recoil mass separator coupled to a 4 pi bismuth-germanate scintillator array surrounding the target.Results: For the low-energy resonances, located at center of mass energies of 149, 181, and 248 keV, we recover stength values of omega gamma(149) = 0.17(-0.04)(+0.05), omega gamma(181) = 2.2 +/- 0.4, and omega gamma(248) = 8.2 +/- 0.7 mu eV, respectively. These results are in broad agreement with recent studies performed by the LUNA and TUNL groups. However, for the important reference resonance at 458 keV we obtain a strength value of omega gamma(458) = 0.44 +/- 0.02 eV, which is significantly lower than recently reported values. This is the first time that this resonance has been studied completely independently from other resonance strengths. For the 632-keV resonance we recover a strength value of omega gamma(632) = 0.48 +/- 0.02 eV, which is an order of magnitude higher than a recent study. For reference resonances at 610- and 1222-keV, our strength values are in agreement with the literature. In the case of direct capture, we recover an S factor of 60 keV b, consistent with prior forward kinematics experiments.Conclusions: In summary, we have performed the first direct measurement of Ne-22(p, gamma)Na-23 in inverse kinematics. Our results are in broad agreement with the literature, with the notable exception of the 458-keV resonance, for which we obtain a lower strength value. We assessed the impact of the present reaction rate in reference to a variety of astrophysical environments, including AGB stars and classical novae. Production of Na-23 in AGB stars is minimally influenced by the factor of 4 increase in the present rate compared to the STARLIB-2013 compilation. The present rate does however impact upon the production of nuclei in the Ne-Al region for classical novae, with dramatically improved uncertainties in the predicted isotopic abundances present in the novae ejecta.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000575176500007

Fungi are no exception, although little is known about how they withstand anthropogenic pollution. Here, we document adaptation in the mycorrhizal fungusSuillus luteusdriven by soil heavy metal contamination. Genome scans across individuals from recently polluted and nearby unpolluted soils in Belgium revealed low divergence across isolates and no evidence of population structure based on soil type. However, we detected single nucleotide polymorphism divergence and gene copy-number variation, with different genetic combinations potentially conferring the ability to persist in contaminated soils. Variants were shared across the population but found to be under selection in isolates exposed to pollution and located across the genome, including in genes involved in metal exclusion, storage, immobilization and reactive oxygen species detoxification. Together, our results point toS. luteusundergoing the initial steps of adaptive divergence and contribute to understanding the processes underlying local adaptation under strong environmental selection.									10	1	0	0	7	0	11			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000569774200001	32866320

Recently, cobalt-based molecular complexes have emerged as one of the realistic candidates for this key role of H-2 evolution catalyst due to their intrinsic oxygen tolerance and moderately efficient proton reduction ability. However, the issues pertaining to the water solubility and long-term stability of those cobalt complexes have limited their practical applications. Recently, several research groups have adopted an enzyme-inspired catalyst design strategy, where variable basic functionalities were appended around the existing core-cobalt complexes to improve their water solubility. Additionally, presence of these peripheral groups enhances catalytic H-2 evolution activity of the modified complexes by boosting the proton transduction around the framework. Inclusion of this biomimetic outer coordination sphere feature also induced structural flexibility around the metal core to improve the stability of the complexes under demanding catalytic conditions. In this article, we have specifically portrayed the multidimensional regulatory roles effectuated by these fluxional basic functionalities during the catalytic H-2 production by the cobalt-based molecular complexes.

Dark grown cells, devoid of oxygen evolution, were illuminated at 0.8 mu E m(-2) s(-1) light intensity which promotes optimal activation of oxygen evolution, or at 17 mu E m(-2) s(-1), where photoactivation compete with deleterious photodamage. The involvement of the two redox active cofactors tyrosine(D) and cytochrome b(559) during the photoactivation process, was investigated by EPR spectroscopy. Tyrosine(D) on the D-2 reaction center protein functions as auxiliary electron donor to the primary donor P-680(+) during the first minutes of photoactivation at 0.8 mu E m(-2) s(-1) (compare with Rova et al., Biochemistry, 37 (1998) 11039-11045.). Here we show that also cytochrome b(559) was rapidly oxidized during the first 10 min of photoactivation with a similar rate to tyrosine(D). This implies that both cytochrome b(559) and tyrosine(D), may function as auxiliary electron donors to P-680(+) and/or the oxidized tyrosine; on the D-1 protein, to avoid photoinhibition before successful photoactivation was accomplished. As the catalytic water-oxidation successively became activated, Tyrosine(D) remained oxidized while cytochrome b(559) became rereduced to the equilibrium level that was observed prior to photoactivation. At 17 mu E m(-2) s(-1) light intensity, where photoinhibition competes significantly with photoactivation, tyrosine(D) was very rapidly completely oxidized, after which the amount of oxidized tyrosine(D), decreased due to photoinhibition. In contrast, cytochrome b(559) became reduced during the first 2 min of photoactivation at 17 mu E m(-2) s(-1). After this, it was reoxidized, returning to the equilibrium level within 10 min. Thus, during in vivo photoactivation in high-light cytochrome b(559) serves two functions. Initially, it probably oxidizes the reduced primary acceptor pheophytin, thereby relieving the acceptor side of reductive pressure, and later on it serves as auxiliary electron donor, preventing donor-side photoinhibition.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a complex four-electron process that constitutes the most energy-inefficient step in water electrolysis. Here we describe a novel electrochemical method for the deposition of a family of thin-film transition metal (oxy)hydroxides as OER catalysts. The thin films have nanodomains of crystallinity with lattice spacing similar to those of double-layered hydroxides. The loadings of these thin-film catalysts were accurately determined with a resolution of below 1 mu g cm(-2) using an electrochemical quartz microcrystal balance. The loading-activity relations for various catalysts were established using voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy. The thin-film catalysts have up to four types of loading-activity dependence due to film nucleation and growth as well as the resistance of the films. A zone of intrinsic activity has been identified for all of the catalysts where the mass-averaged activity remains constant while the loading is increased. According to their intrinsic activities, the metal oxides can be classified into three categories: NiOx, MnOx, and FeOx belong to category I, which is the least active; CoOx and CoNiOx belong to category II, which has medium activity; and FeNiOx, CoFeOx, and CoFeNiOx belong to category III, which is the most active. The high turnover frequencies of CoFeOx and CoFeNiOx at low overpotentials and the simple deposition method allow the fabrication of high-performance anode electrodes coated with these catalysts. In 1 M KOH and with the most active electrode, overpotentials as low as 240 and 270 mV are required to reach 10 and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively.									290	19	0	0	17	0	294			0002-7863			WOS:000380295600043	27344954

In particular, the influence of the reaction atmosphere (N-2, air) was investigated. Different gases were identified in the headspace volume of the reactor depending on the substrate. In general, the evolution of the gases was more effective in air compared to a N-2 atmosphere. In the presence of air, the gaseous phase contained CO2, CH4 and H-2, regardless of the substrate used. Moreover, formation of C2H6 and C3H8 in the case of acetic acid and C2H6 in the case of ethanol was observed. In case of acetic acid and methanol an increase in H-2 evolution under aerated conditions was observed. It was concluded that the photocatalytic decomposition of organic compounds with simultaneous generation of combustible hydrocarbons and hydrogen could be a promising method of "green energy" production.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				1420-3049		WOS:000346793200022	25432013

This study describes the development of free-standing nitrogen-doped carbon nanofiber (N-CNF) electrodes that incorporated cobalt/cobalt oxide (Co/CoOx) nanoparticles (NPs) and were decorated with palladium NPs (Pd NPs). These free-standing electrodes displayed high electrocatalytic activity during electrochemical water splitting, and were fabricated in three steps: (i) solution electrospinning of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/cobalt acetate nanofiber mats; (ii) PAN/cobalt acetate nanofiber mat peroxidation and stabilization in air atmosphere followed by pyrolysis (carbonation) in nitrogen atmosphere; and (iii) decoration of the electrode surface with 5 and 10 nm Pd NPs by controlled atomic layer deposition (ALD) (100 and 200 cycles, respectively). The N-CNF-Co/CoOx-Pd electrode performance was tested in simultaneous hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) with an alkaline electrolyte solution (1 M KOH). The electrodes were as electroactive as Pt and IrO2 (reference electrodes) for overall electrochemical water splitting. The most efficient electrode displayed very interesting overpotential (100 mV and 160 mV @ j = 10 mA cm(-2) for HER and OER, respectively), Tafel slope (33 and 113 mV dec(-1)), and exchange current density (1.15 and 22.4 mA cm(-2)) values. Interestingly, electrodes with the smallest Pd NP size (5 nm/100 ALD cycles) showed higher electrocatalytic activity for HER and OER than electrodes coated with bigger particles (10 nm/200 ALD cycles) and the reference Pt electrode. The effect of Co/CoOx NP encapsulation in the graphitic layers of N-CNFs and coating with Pd NPs on the electrode electrocatalytic activity are discussed in detail.									15	0	0	0	0	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000664470300001

In particular, we concentrate on so-called standard Galactic cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in which Li, Be, and B are produced (predominantly) by the inelastic scattering of accelerated protons and alpha off of CNO nuclei in the ambient interstellar medium. If O/Fe is constant at low metallicities, then the Li-6 versus Fe/H evolution - as well as Be and B versus Fe/H - has difficulty in matching the observations. However, recent determinations of Population II oxygen abundances, as measured via OH lines, indicate that O/Fe increases at lower metallicity; if this trend is confirmed, then the Li-6 evolution in a standard model of cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis is consistent with the data. We also show that another key indicator of (LiBeB)-Li-6 origin is the Li-6/Be ratio which also fits the available data if O/Fe is not constant at low metallicity. Finally we note that Li-6 evolution in this scenario can strongly constrain the degree to which Li-6 and Li-7 are depleted in halo stars. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, the difficulty in obtaining a high photocurrent value limits its application in photoelectrocatalysis water splitting. In this article, bimetallic NiMoO4 nanosheets co-catalyst was decorated onto TiO2/g-CN heterojunction to form TiO2/g-CN/NiMoO4 3D nanostructure. We obtained a photocurrent density as high as 1.8 mA/cm(2) under 1 sun illumination at 1.23 V versus RHE, which is 2 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 nanorods arrays (NRs). The improved performance mainly comes from two aspects. One is g-CN expands the response range to visible light, and forms a heterojunction with TiO2, which improves the efficiency of charge separation at the same time. The other is that the addition of bimetallic NiMoO4 nanosheets oxygen evolution cocatalyst increases the surface active sites, and reduces the surface reaction barrier to promote oxidation reaction.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0038-1101	1879-2405		WOS:000572900700008

Under the synergetic effect between Co(OH)(2) and CuO clusters, Co(OH)(2)/CuO afforded an excellent high oxygen output ratio (1955 ymol.h(-1).g(-1)). According to electron spin resonance measurements and radical capture experiments, sulfate radicals were confirmed as the main active species. The results of DFT simulations demonstrated that Co(OH)(2)/CuO was a kind of metal-semiconductor complex, which was inclined to transfer charge carriers across the interface efficiently and unidirectionally. Based on the locations of the valence band and conduction band, the mechanism of the photocatalytic WOR was proposed. We hope that this contribution will offer useful guidance for developing efficient photoinduced charge-transfer water-oxidation catalysts without photosensitizers.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0888-5885			WOS:000502687700008

The oxidation experiments were conducted in a glove box into which a gas mixture of Ar and Ar + O-2 (1%) was introduced continuously to maintain a given DO concentration. The DO concentration was changed by varying the mixing ratio of Ar and Ar + O-2 (1%). The decay constant of the oxidation (lambda) was estimated from the experimental data, by assuming that the reaction shows pseudo-first-order behavior:-d[Fe(II)]/dt = lambda[Fe(II)] = k [Fe(II)][O-2](x)[OH-](y),which indicates lambda (k[O-2](x)[OH-](y)) depends on the solution pH and DO concentration. After determining the pH dependence of the oxidation rate (k '' = k[OH-](y)), we obtained the relationships between the modified rate constant (k' = k[O-2](x)) and P-O2. The relationships revealed that the oxidation rate deviated from the linear dependence (x = 1) at low P-O2 (<10(-2) atm) and that the oxidation proceeded faster than in the case where x was assumed to be 1. Our results implied that the atmospheric O-2 levels (between 2.5 and 2.0 Ga) estimated from the Fe(II) oxidation in paleosols, ancient soils formed by weathering, are overestimated if the x dependence of the oxidation rate is not taken into account.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			1345-6296	1349-3825		WOS:000292529200003		
J	CAMPBELL, A								ON DETERMINING THE PRIMORDIAL HELIUM ABUNDANCE FROM THE SPECTRA OF H-II GALAXIES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				401	1			157	167		10.1086/172049				DEC 10 1992	1992	A data set of 53 H II galaxies and giant H II regions with reliable observational uncertainties reveals a highly significant physical dispersion in the oxygen abundance helium abundance relation commonly used to infer the primordial helium abundance (He/H)p. Consideration of possible sources of scatter indicates that it is almost certainly one-sided, i.e., upward from a minimum value of He/H at each O/H. The presence of an asymmetric physical dispersion violates the assumptions of conventional least-squares fitting, and hence casts doubt on values of (He/H)p obtained by extrapolation of ridge-line fits to the O/H-He/H relation.The loss of oxygen- but not helium in supernova explosions will lead naturally to a positive dispersion in He/H. Such galactic winds must be present in H II galaxies because their masses are significantly below the critical mass needed for prevention. The observed dispersion can be explained by chemical evolution models in which between 0% and 95% of the newly synthesized oxygen is lost. Variations in the time between successive bursts of star formation and incomplete mixing of newly synthesized helium will also introduce upward scatter in He/H.We therefore conclude that (He/H)p can be reliably determined only by fitting to the lower envelope of the O/H-He/H relation. The paucity of galaxies near the envelope makes its position difficult to determine at present, but existing data give (He/H)p = 0.0759 +/- 0.0014, somewhat higher than the recent, very low estimate of 0.0738 +/- 0.0016, obtained via ridge-line fitting. More high-quality H II galaxy data with reliable formal uncertainties are required to establish the position of the lower envelope of the O/H He/H relation and produce an accurate value for (He/H)p.									22	0	0	0	0	0	22			0004-637X			WOS:A1992KB24300017

Herein, a novel S-scheme heterojunction of Ta3N5/BiOCl with oxygen vacancies (OVs) was fabricated via a facile method. The charge separation and transport mechanism of this Ta3N5/BiOCl S-scheme heterojunction was verified by the analyses of band energy structures, active species, photoelectric behaviors and DFT theoretical calculation. Compared with Ta3N5 and BiOCl, the Ta3N5/BiOCl unveils substantially upgraded photocatalytic property under visible light, and the photocatalytic efficiency for removal of tetracycline (TC) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) reaches 89.6% and 91.6%, respectively. The substantial enhancement of the photocatalytic activity is attributed to the synergistic effect of the S-scheme hetero-structure and oxygen vacancies, which improves the visible-light absorption, while promoting the spatial separation of charge carriers with the optimum redox capacity, thereby boosting the production of active species for catalytic reactions. The TC degradation pathway is deduced and the toxicity evolution of TC is appraised using the QSAR method. In a nutshell, this work gives a deep understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism based on Ta3N5/BiOCl as well as presents a newfangled thought for developing highly efficient S-scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for water decontamination.

Herein, we report on phase-pure spinel-type CoV2-xFexO4 nanoparticles with 0 <= x <= 2 as a new class of bifunctional catalysts for the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR). The mixed-metal oxide catalysts exhibit high catalytic activity for both OER and ORR that strongly depends on the V and Fe content. CoV2O4 is known to exhibit a high conductivity, while in CoFe2O4 the cobalt cation distribution is expected to change due to the inversion of the spinel structure. The optimized catalyst, CoV1.5Fe0.5O4, shows an overpotential for the OER of similar to 300 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) with a Tafel slope of 38 mV dec(-1) in alkaline electrolyte. DFT+U+SOC calculations on cation ordering confirm the tendency toward the inverse spinel structure with increasing Fe concentration in CoV2-xFexO4 that starts to dominate already at low Fe contents. The theoretical results also show that the variations of oxidation states are related to the surface region, where the redox activity was found experimentally to be manifested in the transformation of V3+ -> V2+. The high catalytic activity, facile synthesis, and low cost of the CoV2-xFexO4 nanoparticles render them very promising for application in bifunctional electrocatalysis.									76	1	0	0	3	0	76			2155-5435			WOS:000424735000066

However, the gas generated therein interferes with the accurate measurement by covering the catalyst surface. In this study, we have developed a new evaluation method for a powder oxide electrocatalyst using an alkaline electrolyte. This measurement and analysis method can obtain the intrinsic catalyst activity with no influence from the generation of bubbles. To establish this method, the electrolyzer for evaluation adopts the interdigit flow field for the forced-flow method, and the two methods, namely time zero analysis and flow rate infinitization analysis, were demonstrated by the extrapolation of the measurement data. As a result, the combination of forced-flow method and time-zero analysis is the best evaluation method for the determination of kinetic current at time zero as the equivalent of the no-generation gas condition.

Herein, we report that the CoOx/Ni(OH)(x) bilayer as a typical HSL could effectively extract and store photogenerated holes from Ta3N5, resulting in a decent photocurrent enhancement and stable water oxidation for at least 30 h. Most strikingly, the reversible formation of Co(IV) species inside the ultrathin CoOx layer during PEC water oxidation is found to regulate the hole-storage process, leading to facilitated photogenerated hole extraction capacity and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, upon the insertion of the CoOx/Ni(OH)(x) bilayer for the Ta3N5/CoPi photoanode, the photocurrent could be evidently increased, emphasizing the general applicability of the HSL strategy in promoting water oxidation reaction.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2155-5435			WOS:000709692900030

For a better hydrogen evolution, a 10 nm Pt layer has been sputtered on the Ni supports before Ag deposition. In a subsequent step, the Ag network has been modified by electrochemical Pt deposition in a replacement reaction forming a porous Pt@Ag network. Different Pt species are formed at different positions of the Ag network: Pure Pt on top and Ag1Pt1 alloy at the interface between the Ag network and the deposited Pt film. Laser structuring the substrate in advance can facilitate mass transport, especially for the galvanic Pt replacement reaction, and improves the performance of the electrode. As a result, the performance of the Pt@Ag network on laser structured electrodes is significantly higher compared to a non-structured electrode. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the low electron-hole separation efficiency in semiconductors has slowed the development of this technology. The effect of defects on electron-hole separation is not always clear. A model atomically thin structure of single-unit-cell Bi3O4Br nanosheets with surface defects is proposed to boost photocatalytic efficiency by simultaneously promoting bulk- and surface-charge separation. Defect-rich single-unit-cell Bi3O4Br displays 4.9 and 30.9 times enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and nitrogen fixation activity, respectively, than bulk Bi3O4Br. After the preparation of single-unit-cell structure, the bismuth defects are controlled to tune the oxygen defects. Benefiting from the unique single-unit-cell architecture and defects, the local atomic arrangement and electronic structure are tuned so as to greatly increase the charge separation efficiency and subsequently boost photocatalytic activity. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for next-generation photocatalysts.									207	11	0	0	21	0	206			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000477972300002	31081183

However, both the low density of single atomic (SA) MNx active sites and restricted mass transfer render these M-N-C based air electrodes inferior in cell performance. In this study, a new ZIF8-derived Fe-N-C catalyst/electrode design combining local chemistry tuning and primary morphology tailoring to address the above two critical issues is shown. The introduction of nitrogencarbon defects in ZIF8 host enables a controlled atomic-scale dispersion of FeNx moieties, increasing their content in support materials. Also, the simultaneous structural arrangement of individual ZIF8 nano-grains endows the catalyst with a unique porous micro-spheric morphology. This result in an advanced 3D air electrode featuring dense SA FeNx sites and ample, multiscale macro-sized pore channels, which can significantly increase the intrinsic catalytic activity, facilitate bulk mass transport, and generate more effective triple-phase interfaces for ORR. The present catalyst/electrode design exhibits a record large peak power density of ca. 0.60 W cm-2 under practical air conditions. This approach provides a feasible way for boosting the air cathode interfacial ORR and further enlightens electrode designs for energy devices involving multiphase electrochemical reactions.									18	2	0	0	0	0	20			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000640489200001

Overpotential losses from different sources and gases products from each electrode are analyzed. Results show that the process of a CO2/CH4 redox SOC is exactly a combination of the cathode process of a CO2-SOEC and the anode process of a CH4-SOFC. With the same CO and syngas obtained, a CO2/CH4 redox SOC consumes less energy because it avoids oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of a CO2-SOEC and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of a CH4-SOFC. At 500 mA cm(-2), the overall resistance of an electrolyte-supported CO2/CH4 redox SOC is only half of that for separately reducing CO2 in an SOEC and oxidizing CH4 in an SOFC. The conversion of CH4 and yield of H-2 in the SOC approach 81% and 63%, respectively. An anode-supported CO2/CH4 redox SOC is operated stably for 110 h at 1 A cm(-2) under an applied voltage of similar to 0.9 V. Sufficient current density may prevent high performance Ni-based anode from coking.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0013-4651	1945-7111		WOS:000764316900001

Nanostructure-interface engineering has proven to be an effective way to construct highly efficient PEC water oxidation photoanodes with good light capture, carrier transport, and water oxidation kinetics. However, from theoretical and application perspectives, the relationship between the nanostructure and interface of photoanode materials and their PEC performance remains unclear. In this review, the PEC water oxidation reaction mechanism and evaluation criteria are briefly presented. The theoretical basis and research status of the nanostructure-interface engineering on constructing high-performance PEC water oxidation photoanodes are summarized and discussed.

Herein, via the first-principles calculations, we enable to access the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction on metal- and nitrogen-codoped graphene. It is found that the adsorption strength of the reaction intermediates is governed by the coordination environments of the doped metal atoms, causing a significant activity difference between different metal dopants. The adsorption free energy of CO was identified as a practical descriptor of the activity of both CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) according to the constructed linear relationship, which provides guidance for achieving the high CO2 reduction activity and the selectivity to CO simultaneously. Our finding is insightful for developing highly effective reduction catalysts based on the codoped carbon materials.									21	2	0	0	1	0	21			2168-0485			WOS:000526884000034

Techniques such as BET analysis, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, and Raman and XRD spectroscopy were employed to characterize the as-prepared catalysts. The results revealed that the pore formers were beneficial for improving the physicochemical properties of the catalysts with higher specific surface areas, Larger pore volumes and more surface active sites in comparison with those of the sample without the addition of Mg(OH)(2). Moreover, the as-prepared catalysts show a remarkable catalytic performance for selective oxidation of ethylbenzene with 99.8% ethylbenzene conversion and 99.9% selectivity to acetophenone. In addition, the efficient catalytic performance of the catalysts was ascribed to the improved structure-activity relationship, suitable ratio of Co2+ to Co3+ and the synergistic effect between Co and N-C.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000445825800042

Only 8 min of reaction time are needed rather than days to synthesize ceria nanostructures in the traditional batch hydrothermal method. During the synthesis, reaction temperatures and base concentration have been demonstrated as the key factors responsible for the shape evolution. Accordingly, a morphological phase diagram was determined. In addition, polyvinylpyrrolidone was introduced to realize the transformation from ceria nanorods to nanocubes under unfavorable hydrothermal conditions. Catalytic performance of different CeO2 architectures was also examined in decomposing hydrogen peroxide and a reactivity trend (nanoparticles < nanorods < nonocubes) was observed. This is assumed to be related with different surface oxygen vacancy amounts as a result of {110}/{100} preferential planes, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman analyses as well as density functional theory (DFT+U) calculations.									15	3	0	0	2	0	16			0888-5885			WOS:000434895300022

The flow field was initialized using three shock theory, and the reflection of the triple point on a plane of symmetry was studied. The conditions simulated a stoichiometric methane-oxygen detonation cell at low pressure on time scales preceding ignition when the gas was assumed to be inert. Viscosity was found to play an important role on some shock reflection mechanisms believed to accelerate reaction rates in detonations when time scales are small. A small wall jet was present in the double Mach reflection and increased in size with Reynolds number, eventually forming a small vortex. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities were absent, and there was no Mach stem bifurcation at Reynolds numbers corresponding to when the Mach stem had travelled distances on the scale of the induction length. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are found to not likely be a source of rapid reactions in detonations at time scales commensurate with the ignition delay behind the Mach stem.					25th International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS)25th International Colloquium on the Dynamics of Explosions and Reactive Systems (ICDERS)	AUG 02-07, 2015AUG 02-07, 2015		Leeds, ENGLANDLeeds, ENGLAND	9	0	0	0	0	0	9			0938-1287	1432-2153		WOS:000382406400003

Isothermal yield-time curves for the evolution of product oxygen (1.27 mol O2 per mol Cu(MnO4)2) were sigmoid shaped and data fitted the Avrami-Erofe'ev equation (n = 2): [-ln(1 - alpha)]1/2 = kt, between 0.03 < alpha < 0.93 (where alpha is the fractional reaction). The activation energy for decomposition was 115 +/- 15 kJ mol-1.In the mechanistic discussion presented it is concluded that anion breakdown occurred at the interface between the crystalline reactant and an ill-crystallized, probably several constituent, disorganized mixture of residual products. Permanganate anion breakdown is believed to follow electron transfer to a Cu2+ ion (--> Cu+) that is subsequently reoxidized. A principal motivation for the work was as a route for the preparation of a non-stoichiometric, imperfect, microcrystalline mixture of transition metal oxides. The product of the present reaction is being investigated to determine its value as a precursor for the preparation of active heterogeneous oxidation catalysts.									3	0	0		0	0	3			0040-6031			WOS:A1994PC19400020

In this work, we report a novel and feasible method to prepare coralline-like nitrogen-doped porous carbon catalysts with dispersed CoO and metallic Co through high temperature pyrolysis (900 degrees C) and alkaline etching (12 h), which is denoted as (Co@NPC-900)(12). The metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-101-NH2 (Al) acts as the host precursor, and then the second ligand is introduced to chelate Co2+ after one-step post-synthetic modification. The (Co@NPC-900) 12 catalyst possesses high specific surface area (776.59 m(2) g(-1)) and large pore volume (0.617 cm(3) g(-1)), which is in favor of mass transport for ORR. The (Co@NPC-900)(12) catalyst exhibits high ORR performance with a positive onset potential of 1.050 V vs. RHE and a half-wave potential of 0.824 V vs. RHE, which is comparable with the commercial 20% Pt/C. In addition, both the long-term stability and methanol tolerance of (Co@NPC-900)(12) are superior to Pt/C. In general, the prepared (Co@NPC-900)(12) catalyst shows the excellent ORR performance with four-electron pathway in alkaline solution, which can be applied in sustainable energy storage or conversion.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				139	34			11845	11856		10.1021/jacs.7b05121				AUG 30 2017	2017	The photocatalytic O-H dissociation of water absorbed on a rutile TiO2(110) surface in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) is studied with spin-polarized density functional theory and a hybrid exchange-correlation functional (HSE06), treating the excited-state species as excitons with triplet multiplicity. This system is a model for the photocatalytic oxidation of water by TiO2 in an aqueous medium, which is relevant for the oxygen evolution reaction and photo degradation of organic pollutants. We provide a comprehensive mechanistic picture where the most representative paths correspond to excitonic configurations with the hole located on three-and two-coordinate surface oxygen atoms (O3(s) and O-2s). Our picture explains the formation of the species observed experimentally. At near band gap excitation, the O3(s) path leads to the generation of hydroxyl anions which diffuse on the surface, without net oxidation. In contrast, free hydroxyl radicals are formed at supra band gap excitation (e.g., 266 nm) from an interfacial exciton that undergoes O-H dissociation. The oxidation efficiency is low because the path associated with the O-2s exciton, which is the most favored one thermodynamically, is unreactive because of a high propensity for charge recombination. Our results are also relevant to understand the reactivity in the liquid phase. We assign the photoluminescence measured for atomically flat TiO2(110) surfaces in an aqueous medium to the O3(s) exciton, in line with the proposal based on experiments, and we have identified a species derived from the O-2s exciton with an activated O-2s-Ti bond that may be relevant in photocatalytic applications in an aqueous medium.									33	1	0	0	2	0	33			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000409286000036	28768408

The reduction of the n = 1 Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) oxide Sr2MnO4 heated under a flow of 5% H-2-He has been investigated throughout two heating/cooling cycles involving isothermal heating at 500 and 550 degrees C. Oxygen loss proceeds above T similar to 470 degrees C and increases with temperature and time. When the oxygen deintercalated from the "MnO2" equatorial layers of the structure results in the Sr2MnO3,69(2) composition, the RP phase undergoes a first order I4/mmm -> P2(1)/c, tetragonal to monoclinic phase transition as observed from time-resolved in situ NPD. The phase transition proceeds at 500 degrees C but is incomplete; the weight ratio of the P2(1)/c phase reaches similar to 41% after 130 min of isothermal heating. The fraction of the monoclinic phase increases with increasing temperature and the phase transition is complete after 80 min of isothermal heating at 550 degrees C. The composition of the reduced material refined to Sr2MnO3.55(1) and does not vary on extended heating at 550 degrees C and subsequent cooling to room temperature (RT). The symmetry of Sr2MnO3.55(1) is monoclinic at 550 degrees C and therefore consistent with the RT structure determined previously for the Sr2MnO3.64 composition obtained from ex situ reduction. Consequently, the stresses due to phase changes on heating/cooling in reducing atmosphere may be minimized. The rate constants for the reduction of Sr2MnO4.00 determined from the evolution of weight ratio of the tetragonal and monoclinic phase in the time-resolved isothermal NPD data collected on the isotherms at 500 and 550 degrees C are k(500) = 0.110 x 10(-2) and k(550) = 0.516 x 10(-2) min(-1) giving an activation energy of similar to 163 kJ mol(-1) for the oxygen deintercalation reaction.									13	2	0	0	1	0	13			0020-1669			WOS:000314007500057	23294126

Hydrogen generation from the reaction of Al pretreated in acidic or alkaline solution and water								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				45	52	SI		28044	28050		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2020.02.198				OCT 23 2020	2020	Al and Al2O3 film react with strong acid or alkaline solution, bring the extensive corrosion. To decrease the corrosion, Al is first pretreated with a small amount of HCl, NaOH, NaAlO2 and a mixture of NaAlO2+Al(OH)(3) in this work. Al pretreatment allows for the rapid removal of oxide film, shortens the induction time and ensures the initial Al-H2O reaction rate. Typically, immersion of the pretreated Al by a mixture of NaAlO2+Al(OH)(3) into water, generates hydrogen rapidly without an induction time, and the average H-2 generation rate reaches 5.5 mL min(-1). As the Al-H2O reaction proceeds, the potential changes, which is similar to hydrogen evolution of pretreated Al in water. Hydrogen generated rapidly with the consecutive addition of Al, and the initial hydrogen generation rate reaches similar to 37 mL min(-1). Therefore, Al pretreatment by a mixed alkaline solution is an effective method to accelerate hydrogen generation for the first cycle. Rapid and consecutive hydrogen generation by the Al-H2O reaction could provide on-demand and high-purity hydrogen, meet some equipment requirements and promote the competition in renewable-energy sources.

Inorganic nanomaterials have been widely used as efficient catalysts for promoting the electrochemical kinetics. Several approaches to optimize the activities of these nanocatalysts have been developed. The electronic structures of the catalysts play a pivotal role in governing the activity and thus have been identified as an essential descriptor. However, the underlying working mechanisms related to the refined electronic structures remain elusive. To establish the structure-electronic-behavior-activity relationship, a comprehensive overview of the developed strategies to regulate the electronic structures is presented, emphasizing the surface modification, strain, phase transition, and heterostructure. Current challenges to the fundamental understanding of electron behaviors in the nanocatalysts are fully discussed.									199	14	0	0	2	0	201			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000462622700005	30277009

In this work, dendritic porous three-dimensional PtPdRu (PtPdRu-3D) nanocatalysts were fabricated by a facile one-pot hydrothermal strategy with triblock pluronic copolymer P123 as the reducer, stabilizer and structure director. Compared with zero-dimensional PtPdRu (PtPdRu-0D) and two-dimensional PtPdRu (PtPdRu-2D) and commercial Pt/C, PtPdRu-3D showed ultrahigh electrochemical surface areas (ECSA), and demonstrated an outstanding electrocatalytic activity towards methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), specifically 2.9 times higher than that of PtPdRu-0D, 1.3 times higher than PtPdRu-2D, and 1.7 times higher than commercial Pt/C. Besides, durability tests demonstrated that PtPdRu-3D displayed the lowest ECSA decay (from 100% to 80.81%) due to its 3D open-framework surface which can restrain the individual particles from aggregating.

Gas-phase chemical reactions such as thermal decomposition, oxidation and recombination play a critical role in combustion processes. Here we review six applications of synchrotron vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) in fundamental studies of combustion chemistry. These applications range from the use of flow reactors to probe elementary reaction kinetics, studies of pyrolysis in plug-flow reactors and oxidation in jet-stirred reactors, studies of spatial evolution of species concentrations in premixed and non-premixed flames, product distributions in pyrolysis of biomass, and analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) formation. These experiments provide valuable data for the development and validation of detailed chemical kinetic models. Furthermore, some additional potential applications are proposed.

Inspired by the FeMoS cofactor nitrogenase, we report FeMo3S4 as an effective and durable electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). The prepared FeMo3S4 nanorods presented a brilliant NRR performance, with both a high NH3 yield of 65.3 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) and a high Faradaic efficiency of 19.2% at -0.3 V, outperforming nearly all the Fe- and Mo-based catalysts and most first-class catalysts reported to date. Theoretical computations disclosed that the high NRR performance of FeMo3S4 originated from its surface-exposed and low-coordinate Fe sites, which could activate the NRR with a low limiting potential (-0.72 V) and concurrently impede hydrogen evolution to achieve a high N-2-to-NH3 selectivity.									31	0	0	0	1	0	31			2168-0485			WOS:000567778600002

In this work, we have systematically investigated the electro-reduction of nitrate (NO3-RR) to ammonia catalyzed by fluorine doped carbon (FC) synthesized from the pyrolysis of the discarded cigarette filter saturated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) solution. FC electrocatalyst shows an exceptional NO3-RR catalytic performance with Faradaic efficiency of 20% associated with ammonia production rate of 23.8 mmol h(-1) g(cat)(-1), 2 and 4-fold better than bare C electrocatalyst. Furthermore, a stable NO3RR activity is also achieved for FC electrocatalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) results suggest that F dopants efficiently reduce the energy barriers of NO3- hydrogenation and suppress the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This observation will be beneficial for constructing a high-performance metal-free electrocatalyst to electro-synthesize ammonia from NO3-RR. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Combining exoelectrogens catalyzed organic matters oxidation on a bioanode with cathodic CO2ER has a high energy efficiency. However, direct coupling the two half reactions in one electrolysis cell resulted in mismatch problems. Here, a Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) redox-medium-assisted bioanode-driven CO2ER system was developed. Specifically, electrons and energy in organic matters were recovered by exoelectrogens, and then stored in the redox-medium, which was further controllably discharged to drive CO2 reduction to CO on a ZnO/Zn alloy electrocatalyst. Benefiting from the redox-medium, a high energy efficiency of 135% and a CO2 to CO Faradic efficiency of 82% were achieved. The developed system can potentially recover energy from wastewater to valorize CO2 emitted from wastewater treatment and thus evolve traditional wastewater treatment to be a sustainable, carbon neutral, and chemicals producing process.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0001-1541	1547-5905		WOS:000646240600001

The first and most important question addressed was increasing the copper loading with higher dispersion in the silica support. Another task was to elucidate the structure-performance relationship. Furthermore, catalysts with various beta-CD doping levels were systematically characterized and employed in the hydrogenation of dimethyl oxalate (DMO) to ethylene glycol (EG). The 0.1CD-Cu-SiO2 catalyst with 17.39 wt% copper showed 99.9% DMO conversion and the highest EG selectivity of 95.0% at 210 degrees C, as well a lifetime of over 240 h. The reaction results disclosed that the catalytic performance could be tuned facilely by changing the amount of beta-CD doping, which effectively influenced the Cu metallic surface area and dispersion.									25	0	0	0	3	0	26			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000418390700019

The oxidation mechanism C3H8--> k(1) C3H6--> k(2) COx + H2O has been kinetically modelled which permits theoretical evolution of the selectivity as a function of the conversion, for various ratios of K = k(1)/k(2). A good correlation is obtained between the experimental and theoretical curves, validating the kinetic modelling. The value obtained for K is << 1, so the reactivity of propene is much higher than that of propane and justifies the observed yield limitation. Moreover, the rate-determining step of propane ODH reaction as well as of propene oxidation is attributed to the attack of the oxidized site by the hydrocarbon. The value of K, which depends on the type of catalyst may be used to evaluate the selectivity to propene and for classification of oxydehydrogenation catalysts. The work function measurements give the nature and charge of the various oxygen species (O-2(-), O-, O2-) involved in the reaction, and O2- is found to react with propane.									46	1	0	0	1	0	46			0956-5000			WOS:A1995RT00900031

Herein, we report a novel hybrid nanostructure with CoP nanopartides (NPs) embedded in a N-doped carbon nanotube hollow polyhedron (NCNHP) through a pyrolysis-oxidation-phosphidation strategy derived from core-shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between highly active CoP NPs and NCNHP, the CoP/NCNHP hybrid exhibited outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic performances. When the CoP/NCNHP was employed as both the anode and cathode for overall water splitting, a potential as low as 1.64 V was needed to achieve the current density of 10 rnA.cm(-2), and it still exhibited superior activity after continuously working for 36 h with nearly negligible decay in potential. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the electron transfer from NCNHP to CoP could increase the electronic states of the Co d-orbital around the Fermi level, which could increase the binding strength with H and therefore improve the electrocatalytic performance. The strong stability is attributed to high oxidation resistance of the CoP surface protected by the NCNHP.									1134	63	0	0	69	0	1145			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000426143800034	29341596

Numerical results reveal that monolayer SnS2 can be easily synthesized by cleaving its bulk crystal. Besides, the Zn doping in monolayer SnS2 is energetically favored under the S-rich with respect to the Sn-rich condition. The doped system exhibits the magnetic ground states due to the formation of defect states above the Fermi level, which are introduced by the hybridization between S-3p states and a small amount of Sn-4d states. The room temperature ferromagnetism can also be realized in Zn-doped monolayer SnS2. The injection of Zn can enhance the absorption efficiency of solar spectrum, especially in the near-infrared light region. Moreover, the Zn doping can enhance the photocatalytic activity for both the oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in the monolayer SnS2 (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a set of well-defined carbon nanotubes with controlled doping of various N species, such as pyrrolic, pyridinic and graphitic N, have been achieved by in-situ pyrolysis of polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes at different temperatures. Among these synthesized samples, the carbon nanotubes fabricated at 700 degrees C exhibit the highest electro-catalytic ORR activity, long-standing stability and good tolerance against methanol in alkaline medium. The improved activity is mainly attributed to the high nitrogen level of the active pyridinic and graphitic N. But, the pyridinic N possesses higher activity than the graphitic N because of their different sp(2) electronic structures. Pyridinic N, after bonding with two carbon(C) atoms, has two distorting N-C orbitals and one dangling orbital occupied by a lone electron pairs which are exposed, as the N sits at the edge of the carbon planes. Such unique electronic configuration makes the nitrogen and surrounding carbon atoms, bonded in the C-N bonds, can serve host of active sites or work as active sites for the ORR.

P	REN Z; YU L; CHEN S								Synthesis of catalysts for water electrolysis by dissolving iron nitrate nonahydrate and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate in deionized water at ambient temperature and adding nickel foam for growth of sulfur-doped catalysts on substrate					WO2021222077-A1	UNIV HOUSTON SYSTEM																			NOVELTY - Catalysts for water electrolysis are synthesized by dissolving iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O) and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3.5H2O) in deionized water at ambient temperature to form a solution; placing nickel (Ni) foam into the solution, where Ni foam serves as a substrate and Ni source for growth of sulfur-doped (Ni,Fe)OOH (S-(Ni,Fe)OOH) catalysts; leaving the Ni foam in the solution at ambient temperature for 1-5 minutes to provide a treated foam, with S-(Ni,Fe)OOH catalysts growing on the substrate during the duration; and removing the treated foam from the solution after the duration. USE - Ambient-temperature synthesis of catalysts for water electrolysis used as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrodes (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The method relates to a fast, cost-effective, and scalable process to synthesize NiFe-based (oxy)hydroxide catalysts at ambient temperature for high performance seawater electrolysis. A one-step synthesis method is provided to fabricate highly porous, self-supported S-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide catalysts from readily available Ni foam in 1-5 minutes at ambient temperature. This fast synthesis method operates to engineer the surface of Ni foam into a hydrophilic S-doped Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer, which exhibits multiple levels of porosity with a large surface area and numerous active sites. Unlike prior electrodeposition or hydrothermal methods that result in weak contact between the catalyst and the substrate, the Ni foam in the synthesis method is directly reacted with a solution and quickly etched to produce the Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide layer, which produces highly robust contact and strong bonds and contributes to rapid electron transfer and good stability. In addition, sulfur is introduced on the surface and in the lattice of the Ni/Fe (oxy)hydroxide during the reaction, which may tune the valence state of Ni/Fe and optimize the absorption energy of the OER intermediates, thus improving OER activity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for water electrolyzer comprising anode formed by a sulfur-doped (Ni,Fe)OOH (S-(Ni,Fe)OOH) electrode; and a cathode formed by NiMoN nanowire arrays supported on Ni foam.															0						DIIDW:2021C2273S

Specifically, a Co3O4 1D nanobelt acting as the Z-scheme heterostructure component could promote the separation of photo-excited charge carriers and increased the redox capacity, and the conductive PANi brought about the boosted transport efficiency of the charge carriers. Notably, cobalt ions were adopted as the intermediate of the electron transfer between two components for boosting the carrier transport and utilization efficiency. Consequently, the Co3O4 nanobelt, PANi and cobalt ions exhibited a synergistic effect on facilitating the photocatalytic HER performance of the g-C3N4-based heterostructure, and the optimal ternary heterostructure (g-C3N4-PANi-Co3O4) exhibited a photocatalytic H-2-evolution rate of 4.61 mu mol h(-1) under visible light, which further increased to 9.95 mu mol h(-1) by adding Co2+ solution owing to the further facilitated transport of charge carriers through the redox reaction of cobalt ions. Moreover, even in the absence of sacrificial agents, this Z-scheme system exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production activity of 3.35 mu mol h(-1) in the Co2+ aqueous solution under UV-visible light.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000605477500020

Various kinds of transition metal-based electrocatalysts were developed to promote the ORR. Among them, Cu-based catalysts were rarely studied due to their intrinsic de-active feature in bulk state, especially in acidic medium. In this work, single Cu atoms and Cu clusters-anchored nitrogen-doped porous carbons are rationally developed. As electrocatalysts for ORR, half-wave potential (E-1/2) of 0.88 V and diffusion limiting current density (J(L)) of 5.88 mA cm(-2) can be achieved in 0.1 M KOH, exceeding the most of reported non-precious catalysts and commercial Pt/C. Significantly, as-prepared catalysts exhibit the state-of-the-art performance in acidic medium among all of reported Cu-based catalysts with the E-1/2 of 0.80 V and J(L) of 5.86 mA cm(-2). Theoretical calculations indicate that the nitrogen-coordinated Cu atoms are the dominating active sites, and the neighboring Cu cluster increases the electron density of d orbitals of single-Cu-atom, which weakened the O-O interaction, thus further boost ORR performance. This work not only presents a facile strategy to fabricate efficient catalysts but also identifies the great potential of Cu based materials for ORR in both alkaline and acidic media.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000819856900001

We synthesized structurally relevant cuboidal Mn3MOn complexes (M = Mn, Ca, Sc; n = 3,4) to enable mechanistic studies of reactivity and incorporation of eta(3)-oxido moieties. We found that (Mn3CaO4)-Ca-IV and (Mn3ScO4)-Sc-IV were unreactive toward trimethylphosphine (PMe3). In contrast, our (Mn2Mn2O4)-Mn-III-O-IV cubane reacts with this phosphine within minutes to generate a novel (Mn4O3)-O-III partial cubane plus Me3PO. We used quantum mechanics to investigate the reaction paths for oxygen atom transfer to phosphine from (Mn2Mn2CaO4)-Mn-III-Ca-IV and (Mn3CaO4)-Ca-IV. We found that the most favorable reaction path leads to partial detachment of the CH3COO- ligand, which is energetically feasible only when Mn(III) is present. Experimentally, the lability of metal-bound acetates is greatest for (Mn2Mn2O4)-Mn-III-O-IV. These results indicate that even with a strong oxygen atom acceptor, such as PMe3, the oxygen atom transfer chemistry from Mn3MO4 cubanes is controlled by ligand lability, with the (Mn3CaO4)-Ca-IV OEC model being unreactive. The oxidative oxide incorporation into the partial cubane, (Mn4O3)-O-III, was observed experimentally upon treatment with water, base, and oxidizing equivalents. O-18-labeling experiments provided mechanistic insight into the position of incorporation in the partial cubane structure, consistent with mechanisms involving migration of oxide moieties within the cluster but not consistent with selective incorporation at the site available in the starting species. These results support recent proposals for the mechanism of the OEC, involving oxido migration between distinct positions within the cluster.									80	0	0	0	18	0	80			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000314141200023	23241061

Recently, heteroatoms doped (N, S et al.) carbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, have attracted great interests because of their amazing electrochemical activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, nitrogen and sulfur dual-doped three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide (NS-3DrGO) catalysts have been synthesized by a soft template-assisted approach followed by heat-pyrolysis treatment. Results indicate that with high specific surface area, sufficient porous structures, as well as the well-dispersed and doped atoms of N and S, the NS-3DrGO catalysts possess high onset/half-wave potentials together with large diffusing-limiting current density and present a four-electron transfer process in alkaline media. Specifically, at a relatively higher annealing temperature of 950 degrees C, the NS-3DrGO catalyst presents the optimal ORR activity compared with the others, which may be due to its highest amount (74.8 at. %) of the two active nitrogen species (pyridinic N and graphitic N) and the highest amount (79.8 at. %) of active thiophene-S together with the desirable specific surface (391.9 m(2) g(-1)) area and multi-porous structure. Furthermore, the NS-3DrGO catalysts also exhibit superior methanol tolerance and favorable durability. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the phosphorus concentration in the hot metal can reach 0.08-0.11 wt% resulting in operative practice troubles for achieving a final P concentration lower than 0.015 wt%. In this study, a kinetic-thermodynamic model for dephosphorization is proposed and a more efficient dephosphorization procedure of the hot metal in LD converters (350 t) have been developed. The model is a valuable tool to predict the dephosphorization evolution and allows the implementation of a new blowing pattern, able to reach a final P concentration at the end-point lower than the threshold value of 0.015 wt% with only a slightly increase in lime (+10%) and oxygen consumption (+3%).									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1611-3683	1869-344X		WOS:000431677500009

This phenomenon has puzzled biologists because classic theories of life-history evolution predict smaller sizes at maturity in environments that retard growth. During the last decade, intensive theoretical and empirical research has generated some plausible explanations based on nonadaptive or adaptive plasticity. Nonadaptive plasticity of body size is hypothesized to result from thermal constraints on cellular growth that cause smaller cells at higher temperatures, but the generality of this theory is poorly supported. Adaptive plasticity is hypothesized to result from greater benefits or lesser costs of delayed maturation in colder environments. These theories seem to apply well to some species but not others. Thus, no single theory has been able to explain the generality of temperature-size relationships in ectotherms. We recommend a multivariate theory that focuses on the coevolution of thermal reaction norms for growth rate and size at maturity. Such a theory should incorporate functional constraints on thermal reaction norms, as well as the natural covariation between temperature and other environmental variables.

Short periods of photoinhibitory treatment led to obvious decreases in the rates of PSI-mediated electron transport activity and PSII-mediated oxygen evolution in the native or Triton-treated PSI and PSII complexes. In the native PSI and PSII complexes, the protein secondary structures had little changes after the photoinhibitory treatment. However, in both Triton-treated PSI and PSII complexes, short photoinhibition times caused significant loss of a-helical content and increase of P-sheet structure, similar to the conformational changes in samples of Triton-treated PSI and PSII complexes after long periods of dark incubation, Our results demonstrate that strong-light treatment to the Triton-treated PSI and PSII complexes accelerates destruction of the transmembrane structure of proteins in the two photosynthetic membranes.									1	1	0	0	2	0	2			0277-8033			WOS:000170693700008	11565905

Herein, silver mo-lybdenum oxysulfide (AgMoOS) nanoparticles supported by activated carbon with different porous sizes were synthesized through a facile method for photocatalytic H-2 evolution reaction and pollutants reduction. The highest H-2 evolution of 338.9 mu mol/h was obtained by microporous AC-supported AgMoOS (AgMoOS@AC-1) under visible-light irradiation using Na2S/Na2SO3 as a hole scavenger reagent. Likewise, 76.9% of the 4-NP reduction is achieved by in-situ generated proton within 160 min. AC could lower the recombination rate of photo carriers due to its pore channels. Under the dark condition, 10 mg AgMoOS@AC-1 completely reduced MB, MO, RhB, 4-NP, and Cr6+ within 4, 4, 9, 9, and 12 min, respectively. This excellent catalytic activity is due to a good dispersion of AgMoOS nanoparticles on AC-1, electron hopping transport of Mo4+-> Mo6+ ions, and surface oxygen vacancy. AgMoOS@AC catalyst also exhibits good stability and efficiency that provides a practical catalytic application to reduce chemical pollutants and environmental remediation. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, most of them are not designed subjectively and it brings great difficulties to developing and understanding the catalysts with well-defined structure after the reconstruction. We demonstrate here the design and synthesis of ZnCo phosphate that allows a two-step treatment for controllable surface reconstruction with Co2+ or Co3+ (oxy)hydroxide. The surface reconstruction continuously boosts the HER performance in alkaline electrolytes. More aided experiments are designed to disclose that the depletion of PO43- in concentrated alkali and Zn2+ in following electrochemical etching serve as the key to trigger the reconstruction for Co2+-rich hydroxide and Co3+-rich oxyhydroxide, respectively. The reconstructed catalyst can work on hydrogen evolution for more than 50 h at high current density (1200 mA cm(-2)). Density functional theory simulations uncover the atomic-level understanding on the boosted catalytic performance. The energetically favorable electronic structure roots in the interfacial interaction and charge transfer. This work supplies valuable insights for the reconstruction chemistry and paves a new way to rational design heterogeneous catalysts associated with surface reconstruction in alkaline water electrolysers, and can cope with large-scale industrial water decomposition.

Many genes are involved in the reactions from which ROS are generated, but not much attention has been focused on them. To identify these genes, we screened for mutants with an altered sensitivity to oxidative stress in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and isolated a mutant, oxy-5(qa5002). oxy-5 showed an increased sensitivity to oxygen and decreased longevity. The decreased life span in oxy-5 was probably due to increased oxidative stress because it was recovered to a normal level when oxy-5 was cultured under hypoxic conditions. Our genetic analysis has revealed that the responsible gene for oxy-5 encodes a protein similar to mitochondrial ribosomal protein S36. The OXY-5 protein was highly expressed in the neurons, pharynx, and intestine, and expression of oxy-5 from the pan-neuronal H20 promoter efficiently suppressed the increased sensitivity to oxygen in oxy-5. These findings suggested that oxy-5 played an important role in the regulation of the sensitivity to oxygen in neuronal cells in C. elegans.									6	0	0	0	6	0	6			1356-9597	1365-2443		WOS:000285762500007	21156009

The N-triphosPh ligand precipitates from the solution after approximately 1 hr of reflux and can be isolated analytically pure via simple cannula filtration procedure under nitrogen. Reaction of the N-triphos(Ph) ligand with [Ru-3(CO)(12)] under reflux affords a deep red solution that show evolution of CO gas on ligand complexation. Orange crystals of the complex [Ru(CO)(2){N(CH2PPh2)(3)}-kappa P-3] (2) were isolated on cooling to RT. The P-31{H-1} NMR spectrum showed a characteristic single peak at lower frequency compared to the free ligand. Reaction of a toluene solution of complex 2 with oxygen resulted in the instantaneous precipitation of the carbonate complex [Ru(CO3)(CO){N(CH2PPh2)(3)}-kappa P-3] (3) as an air stable orange solid. Subsequent hydrogenation of 3 under 15 bar of hydrogen in a high-pressure reactor gave the dihydride complex [RuH2(CO){N(CH2PPh2)(3)}-kappa P-3] (4), which was fully characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. Complexes 3 and 4 are potentially useful catalyst precursors for a range of hydrogenation reactions, including biomass-derived products such as levulinic acid (LA). Complex 4 was found to cleanly react with LA in the presence of the proton source additive NH4PF6 to give [Ru(CO){N(CH2PPh2)(3)}-kappa P-3{CH3CO(CH2)(2)CO2H}-kappa O-2](PF6) (6).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1940-087X			WOS:000361534800055	25938678	
J	Vincent, Thierry; Gaillet, Bruno; Garnier, Alain								Optimisation of Cytochrome P450 BM3 Assisted by Consensus-Guided Evolution								APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				193	9			2893	2914		10.1007/s12010-021-03573-1		APR 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Cytochrome P450 enzymes have attracted much interest over the years given their ability to insert oxygen into saturated carbon-hydrogen bonds, a difficult feat to accomplish by traditional chemistry. Much of the activity in this field has centered on the bacterial enzyme CYP102A1, or BM3, from Bacillus megaterium, as it has shown itself capable of hydroxylating/acting upon a wide range of substrates, thereby producing industrially relevant pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and hormones. In addition, unlike most cytochromes, BM3 is both soluble and fused to its natural redox partner, thus facilitating its use. The industrial use of BM3 is however stifled by its instability and its requirement for the expensive NADPH cofactor. In this work, we added several mutations to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S that enhanced the turnover number achievable with the inexpensive cofactors NADH and NBAH. These new mutations, A769S, S847G, S850R, E852P, and V978L, are localized on the reductase domain of BM3 thus leaving the oxidase domain intact. For NBAH-driven reactions by new mutant NTD5, this led to a 5.24-fold increase in total product output when compared to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S. For reactions driven by NADH by new mutant NTD6, this enhanced total product output by as much as 2.3-fold when compared to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S. We also demonstrated that reactions driven by NADH with the NTD6 mutant not only surpassed total product output achievable by wild-type BM3 with NADPH but also retained the ability to use this latter cofactor with greater total product output as well.									2	0	0	0	2	0	2			0273-2289	1559-0291		WOS:000640754700002	33860879

However, it remains a major challenge to achieve this aim through a conjoint modulation in morphology and electronic structure. Herein, a metal-organic framework-derived (MOF-derived) Ru doped cobalt-nickel oxide heterostructure grown on Ni foam (Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF) is fabricated by a simple and scalable preparation method. Systematic experimental characterizations verify that through a tailored low-temperature annealing process, the resulted RuCo3O4-NiO-NF can effectively inherit the advantageous two-dimensional (2D) nanosheet morphology of Co-MOF precursor and simultaneously maintain the mechanical robustness of three-dimensional (3D) Ni foam, which are beneficial for active site exposure and charge or mass transport. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculation are hired to reveal that Ru-doping and Co3O4-NiO heterointerface can collectively regulate the electronic state of Ni and Co sites, thus optimizing the H2O adsorption/ desorption and proton adsorption in alkaline HER process. As expected, the optimized Ru-Co3O4-NiO-NF is much more active than the commercial Pt-C (20 wt%) for electrocatalytic HER in 1 M KOH, exhibiting the low overpotential of 44 mV and 115 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm-2. Moreover, the obtained self-supported electrode material can maintain catalytic activity over 60 h at 100 mA cm(-2) without significant decay. This study provides a new perspective for constructing the advanced MOF-derived alkaline HER self-supported electrocatalysts by synergistic engineering of morphology and electronic structure for future energy application.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000725005900002

Here, we embedded Co crystals into a N-doped carbon (Co@NC) on nickel foam (NF) framework and electrochemically oxidized them in situ to construct a CoOxHy [a mixture of Co(OH)(2) and CoOOH] antenna-modified Co@NC core-shell assembly (NF/Co@NC/CoOxHy). The CoOxHy antennas significantly decreased the activation energy of water dissociation to protons (the Volmer step), and hydrogen production over the Co core activated NC shell may follow a multi-carbon catalytic mechanism activated by Co and N atoms. As a result, the NF/Co@NC/CoOxHy configuration exhibits a 40 mV onset potential, a low HER overpotential of 51 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and a current density still reaching around 20 mA cm(-2) after 55 h of stability testing in alkaline electrolyte. Our material functionalization strategy may open up a new approach for developing water-alkali electrolysers for use in efficient renewable energy conversion.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000479086800032	31317159

However, most reported layered oxides suffer from complex phase transitions upon a large amount of Na deintercalation. Here we report a P2-type Na-0.72[Li0.24Mn0.76]O-2, exhibiting exceptionally high initial charge capacity of similar to 210 mAh/g (0.72 Na) based on a pure anionic redox reaction (ARR). Surprisingly, global P2 structure can be maintained with minimal volume change (1.35%) upon complete removal of Na+ ions. This is due to the reduced Coulombic repulsion associated with ARR and consequent suppression of the phase transition as observed in other P2 materials. Here we reveal for the first time that ARR has the functionality of stabilizing the structure, in addition to its role in increasing its already known capacity. This would pave the way for the further improvement of high-energy-density NIBs.									154	17	0	0	8	0	160			2542-4351			WOS:000460076100018

The ignition points determine the properties of a thermonuclear explosion of a Type Ia supernova. We examine the cases of different accretion rates of helium and different initial masses of the white dwarf, which was studied in detail by Nornoto [K. Nomoto, Astrophys. J. 253 (1982), 798]. We find that for all cases from slow to intermediate accretion rates, nuclear burnings are ignited at the helium layers. As a consequence, carbon deflagration would be triggered for lower accretion rate than dM/dt similar or equal to 4 x 10(-8) M(circle dot) yr(-1) which has been believed to be the lower limit of the accretion rate for the deflagration supernova. Furthermore, off-center helium detonation should result for intermediate and slow accretion rates, and the region of carbon deflagration for slow accretion rates disappears.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0033-068X			WOS:000285180400006

In these stars, spanning about 3 mag from the red giant branch (RGB) tip, large variations are detected in the abundances of oxygen and sodium, anticorrelated with each other; this is well-known evidence of proton-capture reactions at high temperatures in the ON and NeNa cycles. One star appears super-O-poor; if the extension of the Na-O anticorrelation is confirmed, NGC 2808 might reach O-depletion levels as large as those of M13. This result confirms our previous findings based on lower resolution spectra (Carretta et al.) of a large star-to-star scatter in proton-capture elements at all positions along the RGB in NGC 2808, with no significant evolutionary contribution. Finally, the average metallicity for NGC 2808 is [Fe/H] = -1.14 +/- 0.01 dex (rms = 0.06) from 19 stars.									39	1	0	0	0	0	39			0004-637X			WOS:000222701500007

The efficiency of this reaction, however, is still low because of the difficulty in promoting both water oxidation and N2 reduction reactions. Herein, we report that a high-phosphorus-doped carbon nitride with surface nitrogen vacancies (PCN(V)) synthesized by thermal condensation under a hydrogen (H2) atmosphere using phosphorus oxide (P2O5) as a phosphorus source efficiently promotes N2 fixation. The large numbers of the doped P atoms on the PCN(V)-P2O5 catalysts enhance the oxidation of water, while the N vacancies reduce N2, facilitating efficient ammonia (NH3) generation with an apparent quantum yield at 420 nm of 3.4%. Simulated sunlight illumination of the catalyst in water under N2 bubbling produces NH3 with a solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency of 0.16%, which is the highest efficiency among the previously reported powder photocatalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-7463			WOS:000811884400001	35522588

Bubble growth and departure modes on wettable/non-wettable porous foams in alkaline water splitting								JOULE				5	4			887	900		10.1016/j.joule.2021.02.015				APR 21 2021	2021	A SUMMARYBubble growth and departure are ubiquitous phenomena in gas-evolving reactions, which govern the overall energy and mass transport. However, an in-depth understanding of the relationship between bubble dynamics and the electrochemical processes, in particular, the wettability effect on a gas-evolving porous electrode remains elusive. Here, we report the bubble dynamics and overpotential observed during alkaline water splitting on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) deposited nickel porous electrode. A slight decrease in hydrophilicity induced a drastic transition of bubble dynamics and a significant increase of the transport overpotential. We show that the porous electrode transitioned from a liquid-filled state to a gas-filled state when varying the wettability, which changed the bubble departure sizes and bubble coverage. As a result, there were substantial changes of the transport overpotential. Our work elucidates the fundamental relationship between wettability and water splitting characteristics, which provides a practical scenario for structuring the electrode for gas-evolving reactions.									24	0	0	0	0	0	24			2542-4351			WOS:000642473100016

While this strategy is elegant and scalable, detailed mechanistic understanding of the self-templating process is lacking. We now report a systematic investigation of the microstructural evolution in porous carbons, including hierarchically micro-/meso-/macroporous materials with variable mesopore size. We focus on a homologous series of well-defined metal-organic coordination polymers, combining the highly abundant Group 2 ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+) with a common ligand. To understand the role of the metal ion in directing the morphology of the ultimate N-doped carbons, we performed a detailed investigation using electron microscopy (HRSEM, HRTEM, EDS), N-2 porosimetry, XRD, XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The rich morphological variations in the carbons determine their activity as metal-free electrocatalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction. In particular, the reaction selectivity (2e(-) vs. 4e(-) pathways) is directed by competition between kinetics and mass transfer, due to confinement in mesopores.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8				2633-5409		WOS:000613740900011

However, the scarcity and high cost of Pt seriously limit the practical application of these catalysts. Decorating Pt catalysts with other transition metals offers an effective pathway to tailor their catalytic properties, but often at the sacrifice of the electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Here we report a single-atom tailoring strategy to boost the activity of Pt nanocatalysts with minimal loss in surface active sites. By starting with PtNi alloy nanowires and using a partial electrochemical dealloying approach, we create single-nickel-atom-modified Pt nanowires with an optimum combination of specific activity and ECSA for the hydrogen evolution, methanol oxidation and ethanol oxidation reactions. The single-atom tailoring approach offers an effective strategy to optimize the activity of surface Pt atoms and enhance the mass activity for diverse reactions, opening a general pathway to the design of highly efficient and durable precious metal-based catalysts.									275	20	0	0	16	0	277			2520-1158			WOS:000471291500011

Here we focus on the crucial, though often neglected, role of the layer thickness on photopolymerization. The temporal evolution of polymerization reactions occurring in droplets of acrylate-based oligomers and in photoresist films with varied thickness is investigated by means of an optical system, which is specifically designed for in -situ and real-time monitoring. The time needed for complete curing is found to increase as the polymerization volume is decreased below a characteristic threshold that depends on the specific reaction pathway. This behavior is rationalized by modeling the process through a size-dependent polymerization rate. Our study highlights that the formation of photopolymerized networks might be affected by the involved volumes regardless of the specific curing mechanisms, which could play a crucial role in optimizing photocuring-based additive manufacturing.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2214-8604	2214-7810		WOS:000853389900003

Herein, we have formulated a cost-effective and mixed-phase (1T and 2H) micro-flower like NiCu-MoS2 catalyst towards the anodic sulfide oxidation reaction (SOR) and cathodic H-2 production via electrolysis. The SOR was initiated at 0.21 V vs. RHE, which is 1.02 V inferior to the thermodynamical potential of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), i.e. 1.23 V. Moreover, it maintains 98.1% H-2 faradaic efficiency with remarkable endurance up to 150 h. Importantly when a H2S electrolyzer was fabricated with NiCu-MoS2, only 0.7 V cell potential was adequate to yield profuse H-2 by H2S splitting, which is practically unachievable for water splitting due to kinetic and energetic complexity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000807549800001

MgO, in a model basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slag based on the CaO-MgO-SiO2-FeO-MnO system have been characterised with regard to the reaction product phases at the dolomite/slag and doloma/slag interfaces by post-mortem microstructural analysis. It was found that after Ih immersion at 1350 degreesC in a stagnant molten slag, the CaO and MgO in doloma react with SiO2 and FeO in the slag forming dicalcium silicate (2CaO . SiO2 or C2S), MgO-rich magnesiowustite ((Fe,Mg)O) and dicalcium ferrite (2CaO . Fe2O3 or C2F). The formation of(Fe,Mg)O and C2F breaks up the C2S layer, leaving it discontinuous. Similar reactions take place in dolomite, but at a later stage of dissolution since they are retarded by the intermediate decomposition of dolomite in which rapid CO2 gas evolution quenches the resulting C2S layer and forms a gap between the resulting doloma and slag. A more complete and continuous dicalcium silicate layer was observed in dolomite compared to doloma.

Herein, we report on the selective CO2RR in aqueous solutions utilizing covalent Co porphyrin polymers with fine-tuned electronic structures. CoP@CNT, CoP-Ph@CNT, and CoP-F@CNT, synthesized by Hay-coupling Co porphyrin monomers on carbon nanotubes, showed higher activity and durability than the respective monomers for CO2RR. By tuning the electronic structures, the CO2RR selectivity of CoP@CNT (FECO > 95%) and CoP-Ph@CNT (FECO > 80%) was significantly improved compared with CoP-F@CNT (FECO < 20%). Remarkably, CoP@CNT catalyzed CO2RR with FECO > 95% in aqueous solutions in a wide overpotential range of 460-760 mV. Theoretical studies suggest that the electron-rich CoI centers of CoP and CoP-Ph can favorably bind CO2, leading to improved CO2RR selectivity.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2096-5745		WOS:000864453100011

Here, we explored 2D palladium thiophosphate Pd-3(PS4)(2), which is a promising photocatalyst absorbing light in the visible range. We obtained a few-layer Pd-3(PS4)(2) through lithium-assisted exfoliation from the bulk phase and characterized it employing Raman spectroscopy, XPS, AFM, and STM combined with DFT calculations. The measured band gap for as-obtained few-layer Pd-3(PS4)(2) is 2.57 eV (indirect), and its band edges span the electrochemical potentials of the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The performance in the water-splitting reaction is studied under acidic, neutral, and alkaline conditions under violet irradiation at 420 nm. 2D palladium phosphochalcogenides semiconductor with bifunctional electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic properties shows competitive performance compared with industrial Pt/C catalysts for solar-driven water splitting under acidic and alkaline conditions.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4				2574-0970		WOS:000613246600050

However, the narrow electrochemical stability window and freezing of water at a low temperature limit the energy density and working temperature range of aqueous Li-ion batteries. Herein, we introduce a "hydrogen bond-captured" solvent, which has lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom, to break the original water hydrogen bond network by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds, resulting in the suppressed hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and reduced water activity. The "LiTFSI(TMS)(0.5)Water" electrolyte enables stable interfacial chemistry, broadens the electrochemical stability window to 5.4 V and exhibits a freezing point lower than -85 degrees C. An aqueous LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4/Li4Ti5O12 full cell achieved an energy density of 136 W h kg(-1) for 300 cycles at 6C. An understanding of how to alter the thermodynamics pathway of the HER in the electrolyte provides a practical guideline for designing high-voltage and wide temperature range aqueous electrolytes for sustainable energy storage applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1754-5692	1754-5706		WOS:000800134100001

The formation and evolution of various oxygenated functional groups (ester, carboxyl, ketone and hydroxyl) was investigated by FT-i.r. spectroscopy using a curve-resolving procedure and acetylation of coat samples. The development of alkali solubility of the coal as a function of reaction time was studied and the average molecular weight of regenerated humic acids (RHA) extracted from the oxidized coal was determined. The lower molecular weight of RHA extracted from highly oxidized coal samples suggests that besides the build-up of various oxygenated functional groups, the development of alkali solubility also results from concomitant 'depolymerization' of the coal network. The latter may occur through oxidation of aliphatic cross-links and formation of ester groups hydrolysable in basic solution. The FT-i.r. results were correlated with the development of alkali solubility. Some oxidation pathways are proposed.									36	1	0	0	2	2	38			0016-2361			WOS:A1994NJ67300012

The microstructure of the compounds formed on the surface of the alloy during the anodic potential sweep was obtained using XRD analysis. The dissolution behaviour of either of the two constituents from the alloys resembles thar of the pure state. The galvanic coupling effect enhances the dissolution of the less noble metal, copper, on alloying with silver. The anodic sweep potential exhibited seven anodic peaks A(1), A(2), A(3), A(4), A(5), A(6), and A(7) prior to the oxygen evolution reaction. These peaks are assigned to the formation of Cu2O, Cu(OH)(2), CuO, Ag2O, Ag2CO3, and Ag2O2 respectively. Potentiostatic current/time transients showed that the formation of Cu2O, CuO, Ag2O, and Ag2CO3 layers involves a nucleation and growth mechanism under diffusion control.									19	0	0	0	1	0	19			0007-0599			WOS:000169445900008

Here, the authors report single iron atom-dispersed Mo-based nanosheets synthesized from a scalable two-dimensional mineral hydrogel approach for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline condition.Hydrogen energy is critical for achieving carbon neutrality. Heterostructured materials with single metal-atom dispersion are desirable for hydrogen production. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve large-scale fabrication of single atom-anchored heterostructured catalysts with high stability, low cost, and convenience. Here, we report single iron (Fe) atom-dispersed heterostructured Mo-based nanosheets developed from a mineral hydrogel. These rationally designed nanosheets exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and reliability in alkaline condition, manifesting an overpotential of 38.5 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), and superior stability without performance deterioration over 600 h at current density up to 200 mA cm(-2), superior to most previously reported non-noble-metal electrocatalysts. The experimental and density functional theory results reveal that the O-coordinated single Fe atom-dispersed heterostructures greatly facilitated H2O adsorption and enabled effective adsorbed hydrogen (H*) adsorption/desorption. The green, scalable production of single-atom-dispersed heterostructured HER electrocatalysts reported here is of great significance in promoting their large-scale implementation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0				2041-1723		WOS:000871124000029	36271088

As deposited similar to30-Angstrom-thick HfO2 on 15 and 25 Angstrom thermal SiO2 were almost entirely amorphous, although a low density of crystalline seeds were observed and crystallization occurred from these nuclei during furnace anneals at temperatures >similar to500 degreesC. The major crystalline phase thus formed was monoclinic, and some fraction of tetragonal phase was observed during crystallization according to transmission electron microscopy electron diffraction analysis. Complete crystallization occurred around 700 degreesC and, at higher temperatures, significant interfacial silicon dioxide growth was observed due to the presence of a small partial pressure of oxygen in the annealing ambient. No significant increase of leakage current in the trap-assisted tunneling conduction regime was observed during the intermediate and final stage of crystallization process.

In this work, copper oxide (Cu2O) nanostructures were obtained via an electrochemical transformation of a copper dithioxamide Cu(dto) chelate polymer in 1 M KOH solution. To improve conductivity and dispersion of Cu2O, the electrochemical transformation took place in the acetylene black matrix. The resultant Cu2O/C nanocomposite was grown on a glassy carbon electrode and its electrocatalytic activity towards ORR in 1 M KOH was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disk electrode (RDE) linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The ORR activity was observed in O-2-saturated KOH solutions. The value of the half-wave potential (E-1/2) was estimated to be 0.72 V vs. RHE, which is close to the E-1/2 value of the benchmark 40 % Pt/C catalysts. The electron transfer number, n, was found to be 3, suggesting that in addition to the direct 4e(-) reduction process, the 2e(-) reduction processes also occur, mostly on the carbon matrix. The results indicate that the Cu(dto)-derived Cu2O/C nanocomposite may provide a cost-effective alternative to noble metals ORR electrocatalyst due to its better mass activity and stability in alkaline solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000760356900007

However, intrinsically poor electrical conductivity and sluggish reaction kinetics of these oxides normally lead to low specific capacity and slow rate capability of the devices. Herein, a commonly used cobalt oxide is used as an example to demonstrate that lithiation process as a new strategy to enhance its electrochemical performance for supercapacitor application. Detailed characterization reveals that electrochemical lithiation of Co(3)O(4)crystal reduces the coordination of the Co-O band, leading to substantially increased oxygen vacancies (octahedral Co(2+)sites). These vacancies further trigger the formation of a new electronic state in the bandgap, resulting in remarkably improved electrical conductivity and accelerated faradic reactions. The lithiated Co(3)O(4)exhibits a noticeably enhanced specific capacity of 260 mAh g(-1)at 1 A g(-1), approximately fourfold enhancement compared to that of pristine Co3O4(66 mAh g(-1)). The hybrid supercapacitor assembled with lithiated Co3O4//N-doped activated carbon achieves high energy densities in a broad range of power densities, e.g., 76.7 Wh kg(-1)at 0.29 kW kg(-1), 46.9 Wh kg(-1)at a high power density of 18.7 kW kg(-1), outperforming most of the reported hybrid supercapacitors.									82	4	0	0	3	0	82			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000553779600001

However, the investigation of S-SOECs for CO2 electrolysis has been hindered due to the lack of high performance stable electrodes with good CO2 reduction reaction (CO2-RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity. Herein, a novel perovskite La0.6Ca0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LCaFN) is investigated as an electrode of S-SOECs for CO2 electrolysis. The S-SOEC has a low polarization resistance of only 0.04 Omega cm(2) and achieves a maximum electrolysis current density of 1.41 A cm(-2) at 800 degrees C with pure CO2 at 2.0 V. LCaFN electrodes show good stability and can be recovered by simple air treatment after a period of operation to avoid the formation of carbonates with alkaline earth elements in the perovskite as La0.6Sr0.4Fe0.8Ni0.2O3-delta (LSrFN). The mechanism of self-recovery of the LCaFN electrode by air treatment is discussed and analyzed.									33	3	0	0	0	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400050

Structure of deflagration front of carbon burning in degenerate stellar cores								Pis'ma v Astronomicheskie Zhurnal				8	1			17	25						Jan. 1981	1981	The structure of the time-dependent deflagration front of the carbon burning is considered. This structure obtained in a self-consistent hydrodynamic calculation is typical for thermonuclear burning of the degenerate carbon-oxygen stellar core. The pertinent estimates lead to conclusion that the heating of the matter due to weak shocks is important for ignition of the thermonuclear reaction in the deflagration burning regime. The overall heating of matter up to the ignition temperature is a result of combined action of the adiabatic compression of the pulsating stellar core and of weak shocks from the already burnt core layers which lead to the entropy growth.									0	0	0		0	0	0			0320-0108			INSPEC:1855866

These potentials were estimated based on measurements of absolute (and conventional) acidity constants for several Bronsted acids in DMA including CO2 with water ([H2O] = 1.1 M) of which absolute pK(a) is 18.6 +/- 0.2 in reference to aqueous proton at standard states.

The interfacial capacitance obeys the Mott-Schottky relationship in a considerable potential range and can be assigned to a depletion layer in the diamond. The energetic position of the valence band edge is about 4 and 2 V versus SHE for (100) and (110) oriented diamond respectively. Oxygen and hydrogen evolution occur at large overpotentials (1 V) in agreement with previous results reported for polycrystalline diamond. Interestingly, with reversible redox systems, metal-type redox kinetics around the equilibrium potential are observed. The mechanism of electron exchange between the valence band of diamond and simple redox systems was investigated in detail using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A quantitative model is proposed, that assumes that electron exchange is mediated by bandgap states. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

Herein, 3D continuous nanopatterns with a pore size of 100 nm of nickel phosphide are fabricated and evaluated for acidic electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The 3D continuous nanopatterned catalyst requires a minimum overpotential of 101 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 60 mV.dec(-1), which outperforms most electrocatalysts based on transition metal derivatives. The turnover frequency of nanopatterns is 0.87 s(-1) at an overpotential of 100 mV, which is very close to benchmark electrocatalyst Pt/C (0.90 s(-1)). This nanopatterned catalyst also displays superior durability: up to 250 h of continuous operation without any decay. Experimental analysis suggests that nanopatterns of active materials expose more active sites, and high curvature (r(c) < 100 nm) of nanopores allows fast discharge of gas bubbles for fast and efficient production of H-2 with high stability. Continuous, ordered nickel nanonetworks coated by the nickel phosphide also allow fast transportation of ions to facilitate the H* desorption process, contributing to improved kinetics for outstanding HER activity.									15	2	0	0	1	0	15			2168-0485			WOS:000595489200014

Currently, the wide application of Ru-based catalysts is restricted by its low efficiency which was mainly caused by the severe agglomeration of ruthenium nanoparticle. In this study, manganese (Mn) doped ruthenium oxide catalyst was synthesized through the wetness impregnation method with Beta zeolite as the candidate support for efficient decarboxylation of L-lysine to cadaverine. Structure characterization showed that RuO2 was the main phase of ruthenium oxide nanoparticles. The prepared Ru-Mn/Beta catalysts exhibited a high dispersion of ruthenium oxide nanaoparticle on Beta, which maximized the utilization of active sites. Meanwhile, abundant oxygen vacancies were generated after Mn doping to balance the charge of the disturbed long-term periodic structure in the RuO2 crystalline, which greatly facilitated the adsorption and activation of L-lysine by the capture of carboxylic groups. A full conversion was obtained with Ru-Mn/Beta, and a selectivity of cadaverine up to 54% was reached in a short time of 1.5 h. The cadaverine production rate in Ru-Mn/Beta was 60.8 mg/L/min, which was almost triple that in Ru/Beta (17.7 mg/L/min). The synergetic catalysis of metal active sites and oxygen vacancies provides a new opportunity to design efficient catalyst of decarboxylation of amino acids.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2168-0485			WOS:000708391800010

The homojunction, which features an intimate interface as well as a clean surface, facilitates charge separation and thus improves the photocatalytic O-2 evolution activity. The success of the synthesis relies on a phase-transition process that involves the dehydration of beta-FeOOH tetragonal nanorods (5.02 nm in average diameter and 25.51 nm in length, respectively). We find that the selective calcination temperature is crucial for retaining the rod shape, creating proper surface pores and intermediate phase segregations. If the temperature is too high (300 degrees C), only crystallized alpha-Fe2O3 can be obtained. At a depressed temperature, intermediate amorphous alpha-Fe2O3, instead of the crystallized counterpart, largely emerges in situ, leading to the formation of amorphous alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH intergrowth homojunctions. This preferential growth together with a type-II band alignment favors vertical interfacial charge transfer between the two components. Our results show that amorphous alpha-Fe2O3/beta-FeOOH porous nanorods prepared at 200 degrees C present a profound photocatalytic activity toward water oxidation. The rate of oxygen evolution reaches 90 mu moL h(-1) g(-1) under visible light irradiation without the addition of a cocatalyst. We believe the method can be extended for the design of other intergrowth junction structures for efficient photocatalysis.

The solution containing 1.0 M Pb(CH3SO3)(2) + 0.4 M CH3SO3H + 1.6 M HBF4 is optimized as the electrolyte based on its freezing point, conductivity and dynamic viscosity. At low temperature, its charge transfer resistance is lower than that in Pb(CH3SO3)(2) + CH3SO3H solution. The side reactions of hydrogen and oxygen evolutions are reduced that is beneficial for the electrode-position of PbO2 and Pb. At high temperature, the hydrolysis of HBF4 could be inhibited by CH3SO3H. The corrosion current density is reduced to effectively avoid the corrosion and failure of graphite electrodes. The coulombic efficiency of cells is maintained at 87.3 %-95.1 % within the range -40 degrees C-50 degrees C. The energy efficiency is higher than 74 %.

Glycals substituted at C-3 with a carbamate group undergo, upon dehydration, a prompt allyl cyanate to isocyanate rearrangement to the isomeric N-glycosyl isocyanates, which can be conveniently trapped by one-pot nucleophilic addition with alcohols or amines to afford N-glycosyl carbamates and ureas, respectively. The rearrangement follows a [3,3]-sigmatropic pericyclic mechanism as illustrated by the stereospecificity of the reaction, with nitrogen being delivered at the anomeric position to the same face from which the oxygen at C-3 has departed. Thus, glucal and galactal give beta-N-glycosides exclusively while allal furnishes alpha-N-glycosides. cis-Dihydroxylation of the synthesized unsaturated N-glycosides afford different 1-aminosugars with good selectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-193X	1099-0690		WOS:000842173200001

Among these solids, certain TiO2 materials possessed a trace quantity of anatase-rutile heterojunctions, which are beneficial in obtaining high reaction rates in photocatalytic reactions. In addition, high surface area (above 100 m(2)/g), even when utilizing a high calcination temperature (500 degrees C), and absorption of light at higher wavelengths, due to the grey color of the synthesized titania, were observed as an added advantage for photocatalytic hydroxyl radical formation. In this work, we adopted a photoluminescent probe method to monitor the temporal evolution of hydroxyl radicals. As a result, promising hydroxyl radical formations were observed for all the colored samples synthesized at 400 and 500 degrees C, irrespective of the duration of calcination.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				2073-4344		WOS:000736174300001

With this extremely long carrier diffusion length, it is possible to separate the catalyst layer (metal) with the light absorption region on different sides of the Si photoelectrode, forming a double-side Si photoelectrode for photoelectrochemical water reduction and oxidation. The obtained photocathode exhibits a photocurrent of 39 mA cm(-2)and applied bias photon-to-current efficiencies (ABPE) of 15.4% with stability up to 100 h. Meanwhile, 38.5 mA cm(-2)photocurrent and ABPE of 5.8% with a 200 h stability are achieved when this structure is used as a photoanode. A monolithic unbiased artificial leaf is constructed, yielding an unbiased solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 3.7%. This chemically passivated Si photoelectrode breaks the trade-off between carrier transport and surface passivation in conventional Si photoelectrodes.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000575812500001

Metal Organic frameworks (MOF) and their composites were solvothermally prepared and characterized via FTIR, EDX, SEM and XRD. Electrochemical studies were performed by cyclic voltammetry, electron impedance spectroscopy, chronoamperometry and cyclic stability. Among all the prepared composites, 1 wt % rGO/Co BTC MOF (1.07 mg cm(-2)) demonstrated a promising current density of 130 mA cm(-2) at 1.59 V vs. RHE, a tafel slope of 83.6 mV dec(-1) and resistance of 14.75 omega in 1 M NaOH/ 2 M methanol solution showing much better performance than state-of-the-art Pt based materials.									10	1	0	0	1	0	11			2365-6549			WOS:000536716700025

In the composites, MoS2 clusters composed of several nanosheets are intertwined tightly with rGO sheets. As the amount of rGO in the composites is increased, the crystallinity of MoS2 changes little, but the diameter of MoS2 clusters decreases considerably and they become more dispersive, resulting in a large specific surface area. As compared to the bare MoS2, the as-prepared MoS2/rGO composites exhibit remarkably enhanced light adsorption and photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under visible light irradiation. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra measurements suggest that the enhanced photocatalytic properties can be ascribed to the effective charge separation across the heterointerface in MoS2/rGO composites. It is also demonstrated that the optical and photoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials could be substantially enhanced by the heterojunction with an appropriate band edge alignment, since they possess the largest specific surface area.									25	3	0	0	3	0	26			2046-2069			WOS:000379351600051

Design of a neutral three-dimensional electro-Fenton system with various bentonite-based Fe particle electrodes: A comparative study								MATERIALS RESEARCH INNOVATIONS				19							10.1179/1432891715Z.0000000001315			2	MAY 2015	2015	Three-dimensional electrochemical reactor coupling electro-Fenton degradation of phenol with three kinds of bentonite-based various iron species (Fe-Bent): Fe3O4-Bent, Fe2O3-Bent and Fe-0-Bent, as particle electrodes at original pH (6.24) was investigated. At the optimal reaction conditions, a maximum of 92.48% phenol removal and 67.48% chemical oxygen demand removal were achieved in the presence of Fe-0-Bent. By evaluating Fe leaching behaviours from the particle electrodes during the degradation of phenol, it was found that both homogeneous and heterogeneous electro-Fenton reactions were all involved in the phenol degradation. Moreover, the evolution of (OH)-O-center dot was evaluated and its relationship with Fe leaching and phenol removal was also discussed. The results show that Fe-0-Bent can act as the most efficient catalyst in this system at natural conditions, and the feasibility of the proposed combined system of electro-Fenton and three-dimensional electrochemical reactor in the removal of pollutant from wastewater.									10	1	0	0	5	0	11			1432-8917	1433-075X		WOS:000354959200024

The results indicate that the corrosion resistance of 16MnCu steel was higher than that of 16Mn steel, which was related to the deposition of nano-sized Cu particles on the surface. The deposited Cu might suppress both the anodic dissolution of the ferrite and hydrogen evolution reaction on the cementite, leading to the reduction of the galvanic effect caused by the residual cementite.

This feature raises questions on the nature of the photoactive pigment, which supports light-induced oxidative water splitting in Photosystem II (PS II). In this study, flash-induced oxygen evolution patterns (FIOPs) were measured to address the question whether the Si state transition probabilities and/or the redox-potentials of the water oxidizing complex (WOC) in its different Si states are altered in A. marina cells compared to that of spinach thylakoids. The analysis of the obtained data within the framework of different versions of the Kok model reveals that in light activated A. marina cells the miss probability is similar compared to spinach thylakoids. This finding indicates that the redox-potentials and kinetics within the WOC, of the reaction center (P680) and of Y-Z are virtually the same for both organisms. This conclusion is strongly supported by lifetime measurements of the S-2 and S-3 states. Virtually identical time constants were obtained for the slow phase of deactivation. Kinetic differences in the fast phase of S-2 and S-3 decay between A. marina cells and spinach thylakoids reflect a shift of the E-m of Y-D/Y-D(OX) to lower values in the former compared to the latter organisms, as revealed by the observation of an opposite change in the kinetics of S-0 oxidation to S-1 by Y-D(OX). A slightly increased double hit probability in A. marina cells is indicative of a faster Q(A)(-) to Q(B) electron transfer in these cells compared to spinach thylakoids.									32	0	1	0	29	1	34			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000239762000015	16855726

Here we report the synthesis of ultrathin molybdenum disulfide/g-carbon nitride (MoS2/g-C3N4) vdW layers via an in situ interfacial engineering method. Such MoS2/g-C3N4 vdW layers show outstanding HER activity with comparable potential and Tafel slope to commercial Pt catalysts. Our experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations revealed that the unpreceded electrocatalytic performances originate from the strong interfacial coupling of vdW layers through out-of-plane Mo-N bonding, which therefore enhances hydrogen adsorption/reduction kinetics for HER. These findings will shed light on the programmable catalysts for low cost and highly active water reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is very important to comprehensively and systematically understand the relationship between catalytic active sites and catalytic performance at atomic scale. Here, we discuss and summarize in detail the key and fundamental factors affecting the active site, and relate them to the catalytic performance. First, we describe the effectiveness of active site design by coordination effects. Then, the role of chemical bonds in the active sites in changing the reaction performance is discussed. In addition, for intermetallic compounds, we explore how the spacing of active atoms affects the catalytic behavior. Moreover, the importance of synergistic effect in catalyst design is further discussed. Finally, the key parameters affecting the catalytic performance at atomic scale are summarized, and the main challenges and development prospects of atomic catalysts in the future are put forward.									62	0	0	0	1	0	62			1998-0124	1998-0000		WOS:000810838300004

Representative synthetic methods for porous 2D materials are also introduced classified by top-down and bottom-up routes. In addition, their applications in different aspects of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis are presented systematically.

It was found that the MoP phase was the dominant active site in POM and DRM reactions, and the activity would gradually decrease when more and more MoP was converted to Mo2C phase (non-dominant active site) and then rapid deactivation would occur due to bulk oxidation of catalyst. The redox type mechanism over MoP catalyst was vitally important to keep its structure reasonably well during methane reforming reactions. The MoP catalyst revealed a higher catalytic stability in POM than in DRM, attributing to the higher H-2 yield obtained in POM, which can promote and maintain the redox cycle of catalyst.

This new electroactive compound was found to be very efficient with respect to the chloride-chlorine reaction which was reversible in the 2-7 pH range. The CFTO powder electrode was characterized by linear sweep voltamperometry and electrochemical impedance measurements. On the basis of numerical simulations, impedance spectra were interpreted by considering a porous electrode behavior with a coupled concentration and potential axial gradients. The experimental data were quantitatively accounted for by considering the parallel combination of a number of cylindrical pores, On the CFTO powder, the chloride oxidation mechanism was simply described by a single electron exchange, in accordance with a Volmer-Tafel mechanism.

The as-prepared catalyst exhibits the best performance for H-2 evolution (111.15 mu mol g(-1)) compared with the glucose-Au-SrTiO3 and UV-Au-SrTiO3. Through Xray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), it was found that the high activity of the syzygium-Au-SrTiO3 catalyst could be linked to the interaction between hydroxyls from biomass and the Au-SrTiO3 which resulted in the Au(I)/Au species. Also, the oxygen vacancies and organic biomass groups on the support may play an important role in the activation of formaldehyde, which was further transformed into formate intermediates and decomposed into hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

Although the electronic, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties of carbon materials have been widely discussed based on defect control engineering, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the carbon surface chemistry, which leads to many controversial conclusions. Here, by analyzing various defects on carbon surface, some commonly neglected aspects and misunderstandings in this field are pointed out, clarifying how surface chemistry affects the chemical behaviors of carbon in some specific chemical reactions. With this full-scale consideration of the carbon surface chemistry, the behaviors of carbon materials with various functions can be well defined, which is indispensable for their scalable applications. Perspectives on future developments of carbon surface chemistry are also provided to enable practically accessible design of advanced carbon in those applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000855757100001	36127265

Tungsten-based catalysts have become the most important substitutes for noble metal catalysts because of their rich resources, friendly environment, rich valence and better adsorption enthalpy. However, some challenges still hinder the development of tungsten-based catalysts, such as limited catalytic activity, instability, difficult recovery, and so on. At present, the focus of tungsten-based catalyst research is to develop a satisfactory material with high catalytic performance, excellent stability and green environmental protection, mainly including tungsten atomic catalysts, tungsten metal nanocatalysts, tungsten-based compound nanocatalysts, and so on. In this work, we first present the research status of these tungsten-based catalysts with different sizes, existing forms, and chemical compositions, and further provide a basis for future perspectives on tungsten-based catalysts.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1				1420-3049		WOS:000839886200001	35897927

Herein, we study the impact of graphene and nitrogen- and boron-doped graphene supports on the hydrogen oxidation reaction occurring on Ni, Cu, and Ag nanoparticles using first-principles calculations and published experimental data. We find that doping of graphene leads to a stronger interaction between the nanoparticle and the support, consequently weakening hydrogen adsorption. This leads to increased activity of supported Ni nanoparticles, but decreased activity of supported Cu and Ag nanoparticles. The dopant-induced changes in the hydrogen adsorption energies are quantitatively as important as the adsorption site. To describe adsorption energies for each supported nanoparticle, principal component analysis is introduced to systematically identify molecular descriptors of adsorption energy. Finally, a size-dependent activity model is formulated to close the size gap between first-principles calculations and experiments.									23	1	0	0	0	0	23			2155-5435			WOS:000458707000035

Furthermore, RuxPty alloy surfaces in 0.1 M KOH yield a Tafel slope of similar to 30 mV/dec, in contrast with the similar to 125 mV/dec Tafel slope observed for supported Pt, signifying that hydrogen dissociative adsorption is rate-limiting rather than charge-transfer processes. Ru alloying with Pd does not result in modified kinetics. We attribute these disparate results to the interplay of bifunctional and ligand effects. The dependence of the rate-determining step on the choice of alloy element allows for tuning catalyst activity and suggests not only that a low-cost, alkaline anode catalyst is possible but also that it is tantalizingly close to reality.									65	5	0	0	2	0	65			1932-7447			WOS:000356754900013

This development is reflected by the plethora of candidate catalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as the CO2 reduction reaction, reported in the literature. However, almost none of them entered the stage of application yet. Likewise, the reports on process engineering inadequately address the utilization of these catalysts, as well as electrode and cell concepts, that might be suitable for the market. Evidently, a closer collaboration between chemists and engineers from industry and academia is desirable to speed up the development of these disruptive technologies. Herein, we elucidate the critical parameters and highlight the necessary aspects to accelerate the development of industrially relevant catalysts capable of fulfilling the forthcoming challenges related to energy conversion and storage. The aim of this Perspective, composed by industrial and academic partners, is to critically question current undertakings and to encourage researchers to strike interdisciplinary research pathways.									34	0	0	0	0	0	34				2691-3704		WOS:000656118100002	34467315

In photosynthesis, high quantum yield charge separation is achieved by a series of rapid, photoinitiated electron transfer steps that take place in proteins called reaction centers (RCs). Of current interest are new strategies that couple RC photochemistry to the direct synthesis of energy-rich molecules, offering opportunities to more directly tune the products of photosynthesis and potentially to increase solar energy conversion capacity. Innovative designs link RC photochemistry with synthetic molecular catalysts to create earth abundant biohybrid complexes that use light to rapidly produce hydrogen from water.									46	1	0	0	13	0	48			1367-5931	1879-0402		WOS:000353095700003	25500176

When a CrHCF film is transferred from HCI to another electrolyte solution a ''break-in'' effect is observed during continuous potential cycling past the formal potential of the film. Cyclic voltammetry shows a single electron transfer reaction, and the voltammetric behavior of the electrode can be interpreted in terms of the insertion electrode concept. The ion effect of the supporting electrolyte indicates that the ion permeability of the film is mainly determined by the radius of the hydrated cation. Electrochemical impedance results suggest that the electrode reaction of the film is mainly controlled by the transport of counter-ions. The electrochemical impedance spectra of the original film and the ''broken-in'' film reveal that the large limiting current of the original film in HCI solution is caused by the catalytic evolution of oxygen, rather than by a capacitive current.									20	1	0	0	2	0	21			0022-0728			WOS:A1994NR31000010

J	Gauthier-Lafaye, F; Weber, F								Natural nuclear fission reactors: time constraints for occurrence, and their relation to uranium and manganese deposits and to the evolution of the atmosphere								PRECAMBRIAN RESEARCH				120	1-2			81	100	PII S0301-9268(02)00163-8	10.1016/S0301-9268(02)00163-8				JAN 10 2003	2003	Knowledge of the formation conditions of Francevillian uranium and manganese ore deposits as well as natural fission reactors sheds light on the early evolution of the atmosphere between 1950 and 2150 Ma ago. The model explaining the formation of the Oklo uranium deposits suggests that at the time of sediment deposition in the Franceville basin 2150 million years ago, the oxygen deficient atmosphere would have inhibited uranium dissolution. Dissolution of uranium was only possible during later diagenesis, approximately 1950 Ma. Reduction reactions in the presence of hydrocarbons allowed precipitation of dissolved uranium to U4+, forming deposits with high enough uranium contents to trigger subsequent nuclear fission reactions. Such a model is in agreement with earlier suggestions that oxygen contents in atmosphere increased during a 'transition phase' some 2450-2100 Ma ago. The manganese deposits were formed before the uranium deposits, during the deposition of the black shales and very early diagenesis, and thus at a time when oxygen content in atmosphere was very low. Carbon isotopes data of organic matter show decrease of delta(13)C upward in the Francevillian series (-20 to -46% PDB) reflecting the high CH4 and low O-2 contents in the atmosphere during sediment deposition. This favoured anoxic conditions during deposition of the basinal FB black shales and likewise the migration of Mn over long distances. The manganese precipitated first as Mn-oxides at the shallow edges of the Franceville basin, in photic zones, where photosynthetic organisms flourished. Mn-oxides were then reduced in the black shales forming Mn-carbonates when conditions became more reducing during transgression episodes and/or the first stages of burial. In the black shales, reducing conditions prevailed until recent weathering, allowing the good preservation of organic matter and the Mn deposits. The present-day alteration is responsible for the dissolution of Mn-carbonates and precipitation of Mn-oxides at the water table to form the high grade Mn ore (45-50% Mn). Development of photosynthesizing organisms, a volcanic source of the Mn, and favourable palaeogeography of the Francevillian basins are all important parameters for the formation of the Mn deposits. For the occurrence of the natural nuclear reactors, the age of 2.0 Ga is the main parameter that controls the abundance of fissile 235 U and the critical mass. Before 2.0 Ga the U-235/U-238 ratio was sufficiently high for fission reactions to occur but conditions favourable for forming high grade uranium ores were not achieved. Then, after 2.0 Ga the increase of oxygen in the atmosphere commonly led to the formation of high grade uranium ores in which the U-235/U-238 ratio was too low to support criticality.

J	Kozowska-Szerenos, B.; Jarosz, A.; Maleszewski, S.								Photosynthetic net O-2 evolution enhancement as a sign of acclimation to phosphorus deficiency in bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) leaves								PHOTOSYNTHETICA				47	2			271	276		10.1007/s11099-009-0042-3				JUN 2009	2009	Primary leaves of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) seedlings cultivated for 14 days in a growth chamber on complete (control) and phosphate deficient (-P) Knop liquid medium were used for measurements. The -P leaves were smaller and showed an increased specific leaf area (SLA). Their inorganic phosphate (P-i) concentration was considerably lowered. They did not show any significant changes in chlorophyll (Chl) (a + b) concentration and in their net CO2 assimilation rate when it was estimated under the conditions close to those of the seedlings growth. Light response curves of photosynthetic net O-2 evolution (P O-N(2)) of the leaves for the irradiation range up to 500 mu mol(photon) m(-2) s(-1) were determined, using the leaf-disc Clark oxygen electrode. The measurements were taken under high CO2 concentration of about 1 % and O-2 concentrations of 21 % or lowered to about 3 % at the beginning of measurement. The results obtained at 21 % O-2 and the irradiations close to or higher than those used during the seedlings growth revealed the phosphorus stress suppressive effect on the leaf net O-2 evolution, however, no such effect was observed at lower irradiations. Other estimated parameters of P O-N(2) such as: apparent quantum requirement (QR(A)) and light compensation point (LCP) for the control and -P leaves were similar. However, with a high irradiation and lowered O-2 concentration the rate of P O-N(2) for the -P leaves was markedly higher than that for the control, in relation to both the leaf area and leaf fresh mass. This difference also disappeared at low irradiations, but the estimated reduced QR(A) values indicate, under those conditions, the increased yield of photosynthetic light reaction, especially in the -P leaves. The presented results confirm the suggestion that during the initial phase of insufficient phosphate feeding the acclimations in the light phase of photosynthesis, both structural and functional appear. They correspond, probably, to the increased energy costs of carbon assimilation under phosphorus stress, e.g. connected with raised difficulties in phosphate uptake and turnover and enhanced photorespiration. Under the experimental conditions especially advantageous for the dark phase of photosynthesis (saturating CO2 and PAR, low O-2 concentration), those acclimations may be manifested as an enhancement of photosynthetic net O-2 evolution.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-3604	1573-9058		WOS:000268951600014

However, the low stability, low selectivity, low ammonia (NH3) yield and high overpotential of TiO2 towards NRR strongly restricted its application in NRR. Here, we firstly add H to the lattice to synthesize a black TiO(2-x )with oxygen vacancies (OVs) (B-TiO1.8) for electrocatalytic NRR. After we optimized the amount of H and OVs, the NH3 yield and stability can achieve 31.6 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1) and 100 h at -0.1 V (vs. RHE), respectively, the faradaic efficiency (FE) can achieve 47.7% at 0 V (vs. RHE). In situ FTIR / ESR / XPS / TPD illustrate that OVs can promote the adsorption and activation of nitrogen (N-2), and lattice H can increase the number of OVs and stabilize them, suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and promote the hydrogenation of N-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-3373	1873-3883		WOS:000861362700003

Large surface area, high adsorption affinity, diverse structures and pore topologies, accessible functionalization of tunnels make them attract tremendous attention in catalysis. In recent years,quantities of carbon nanomaterials and metal nanoparticles/carbon composites derived from MOFs used in electrochemical catalysis showed superior catalytic properties in the electrochemical catalysis. For the preparation of the MOFs derivatives with different catalytic functions and high efficiency,it was necessary to focus on the influence of the properties of MOFs materials ( structure,doped heteroatoms, etc.) and heat treatment conditions ( activation atmosphere, temperature, time, and heating gradient, etc. ) on the performance of catalysts. Hence,the preparation of MOFs derivatives and their application in ORR,HER were introduced according to different metal dopants for better design of efficient electrochemical catalysts. At last, an outlook for future research in the field of catalysis with MOFs derivatives was given.			金属有机框架(MOFs)是由金属离子或团簇和有机配体组成的、由中等强度的配位键连接起来的具有分子内孔隙的有机-无机杂化材料.MOFs具有比表面积大、孔隙度高、结构多样性及孔道表面可修饰等特点,因此,MOFs衍生材料在催化领域得到了广泛的研究和应用.近年来,在电化学催化领域,大量的由MOFs衍生得到的碳纳米材料或纳米颗粒与碳的复合物被运用于电催化时表现出优异的催化性能.为了制备出具有不同催化功能且高效的MOFs衍生物催化剂,需要重点关注MOFs材料本身的特性(结构、杂原子掺杂等)与热处理条件(活化气氛、温度、时间和加热梯度)等条件对催化剂电催化性能的影响.因此,主要从不同金属中心离子的角度介绍了以MOFs为前驱体制备多孔碳纳米材料、纳米颗粒/碳复合物的方法及其在还原反应(ORR),析氢反应(HER)两大电化学催化方面的应用,并对MOFs衍生物催化剂未来的发展趋势进行了展望.						9	9	0	0	0	0	12			0258-7076			CSCD:6437261

However, this important rate is very uncertain as a result of the lack of spectroscopic information on most of the levels above the proton threshold in S-31. To reduce these uncertainties, we have measured differential cross sections for the S-32(p,d)S-31 reaction and determined excitation energies for states in S-31. A total of 26 states in S-31 were observed, including 17 above the proton threshold. Five new states were observed. Spins and parities were determined or constrained for 15 of the observed levels through a distorted wave Born approximation analysis of the angular distributions, of which six were made for the first time. We have evaluated 66 levels using existing data in combination with this measurement and calculated a new P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate. We confirmed the spin-parity assignment of 1/2(+) for the state at 6263 keV which dominates the P-30(p,gamma)S-31 reaction rate at lower temperatures in novae, while the state at 6544 keV dominates at temperatures above 0.2 GK. Our results indicate that the P-30(p,gamma)S-31 rate is reduced by up to a factor of 10 at nova temperatures compared to previous estimates.									32	0	0	0	0	0	32			0556-2813	1089-490X		WOS:000248542400077

Herein, mesoporous Cu-Co3O4 electrocatalysts have been prepared using a two-step reaction. The electrocatalytic activity of a series of Co3O4 with Cu doping at different levels, including 0, 5, 15 and 25%, on electrodes for methanol oxidation is comparatively investigated under alkaline conditions. By the virtue of a compositional and structural control, the 15% Cu-doped microstructure showed a low onset potential in methanol oxidation and a high methanol oxidation peak current density with a high mass activity (155.96 mA mg(-1)) and area-specific activity. Moreover, 15% Cu-doped Co3O4 showed an excellent stability in MOR, and could be demonstrated as a kind of superior electrocatalyst towards MOR in alkaline media. This study provides a good idea to design highly efficient electrocatalysts towards MOR due to the synergistic effect of the chemical composition and porous structure.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1144-0546	1369-9261		WOS:000659477500001

In the present study, the nano-casting procedure was adapted to cobalt oxide (Co3O4) microbeads preparation by multi-step ions exchange procedures. By nano-castings -, cobalt-alginate capsules provided the formation of a surface-active bead (140 +/- 0.4 mu m) in Co3O4 nanoparticles (25-35 nm) with enhanced performance for releasing of hydrogen from NH3BH3. Moreover, the catalysts used for 555 min without any mechanical damages during reusability tests and regeneration procedure. The bead type catalyst enabled the rapid and easy recover at the end of the reaction that improved the reuse of catalysts for the practical and curial for a commercial on-board hydrogen production application.

Isothermal potentiostatic and galvanostatic tests were performed on 220 cm single cells under a wide range of operating conditions in order to investigate the "cold start" behaviour. Different parameters have been investigated: the initial water contained in the membrane, the operating voltage, the cell temperature and current. An optimal wetting level of the fuel cell (FC) core for which cumulated heat generated by the electrochemical reaction is maximal, has been observed.Water management analysis from the membrane coupled with cell resistance measurement allowed to formulating a phenomenological interpretation of the overall performance evolution of the FC. FC starving is not only due to ice formation in the cathode layer pores, thus hindering oxygen transport. It is also due to ice formation in active reaction sites increasing the electrical resistance of the cell. Both factors dramatically reduce FC performance under load. The relative balance of each effect has been assessed.					6th International Conference on Fuel Cell Science, Engineering,and Technology6th International Conference on Fuel Cell Science, Engineering,and Technology	JUN 16-18, 2008JUN 16-18, 2008	ASME Nanotechnol Inst; Univ Calif, IrvineASME Nanotechnol Inst; Univ Calif, Irvine	Denver, CODenver, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4318-5	WOS:000262710700084

Herein, using melamine as precursor and metal hydride (i.e., CaH2) as active agent, we facilely incorporate various types of defects (i.e., nitrogen (N) vacancies (V-N), cyano groups (C (math)N) and surface absorbed oxygen species(O-abs)) into g-C3N4 within a single step. The as-prepared material (denoted as MM-H) exhibits narrowed bandgap, promoted photoexcited electron-hole separation rate and facilitated charge transfer kinetics with enlarged BET surface area and massive porosity. As a result, a prominently enhanced photocatalytic H-2 productivity efficiency (1305.9 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) is shown on MM-H. This performance is better than that of g-C3N4 with CaH2 post-treatment (617.3 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)) and raw bulk-C3N4 (178.2 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)).

To determine optimum growth temperature, heat treatment was examined on the material at 880-1,100 A degrees C. Microstructural evolution, phase formation and elemental distribution depending on heat treatments were examined by using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope analysis. Optimum fabrication conditions were determined as 1,020 A degrees C for 24 h under oxygen atmosphere and detailed characterization of corresponding compound was performed. The magnetization hysteresis loops are expounded to be the product of superconducting Eu-123 grains and magnetic Eu2+ ions. The peak effect on the magnetization curves was described by the extended critical state model. Scaling of the pinning force was found such that the peak position is proportional to the irreversibility field H (irr) and the maximum pinning force is proportional to H (irr) (2) .									14	0	1	0	0	0	14			0957-4522	1573-482X		WOS:000331743200052

Herein, we report 2D dendritic PdAgPt ternary nanoalloys with abundant crystal defects such as steps, twin boundary, and atomic holes, which can effectively work as catalytic active-sites. The morphology of PdAgPt nanoalloys can be regulated readily from dendritic nanosheets to nanowheels. Compared with binary Pd68Ag32 nanodendrites, Pd62Pt38 nanospheres, and Pt/C catalyst, the composition- and morphology-optimized Pd43Ag21Pt36 nanowheels exhibit the best mass/specific activity and stability for methanol/ethanol oxidation reaction (MOR/EOR). The mass peak current density for EOR/MOR of Pd43Ag21Pt36 is 7.08/3.50 times of the Pt/C catalyst. Simultaneously, the hydrogen evolution reaction performance of the Pd43Ag21Pt36 nanowheels in terms of the lowest overpotential of 9 mv at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) and high electrochemical stability is much better than that of binary Pd68Ag32 nanodendrites, Pd62Pt38 nanospheres, and Pt/C.									25	1	0	0	1	0	25			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000535246100040	32309921

However, Au has a strong tendency to segregate to the outer surface, leading to the redistribution of the active sites. Unfortunately, the mechanism of such reconstruction and its effect on the electrocatalytic activity have not been thoroughly discussed, largely owing to the complexity of in-situ characterization and computational modeling. Herein, by taking the 55-atom Au13Pt42 core-shell nanocluster as an example, we utilized the neural network potential at density functional theory (DFT) level and the genetic algorithm to search the complex global configurational space. It turns out that it is thermodynamically favorable when all gold atoms are segregated to the surface and the shape of the cluster tends to change from icosahedron to a distorted amorphous structure (at a reduced core, DRC) with a unique gold distribution. Towards understanding the dynamic activity variation of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on this bimetallic Au@Pt system, oxygen adsorption energy calculations show that this reconstruction could not only increase the number of adsorption sites but also dramatically improve the ORR catalytic activity of each site, thus enhance the overall ORR reactivity.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1001-604X	1614-7065		WOS:000692937900001		
J	REISING, H; SCHREIBER, U								INHIBITION BY ETHOXYZOLAMIDE OF A PHOTOACOUSTIC UPTAKE SIGNAL IN LEAVES - EVIDENCE FOR CARBONIC-ANHYDRASE CATALYZED CO2-SOLUBILIZATION								PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH				42	1			65	73		10.1007/BF00019059				OCT 1994	1994	A photoacoustic pulse-modulation technique is applied for the study of a CO2-stimulated gas uptake signal in leaves (Reising and Schreiber, Photosynth Res 31: 227-238, 1992). It is shown that this uptake signal can be substantially suppressed by application of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, ethoxyzolamide, to leaf discs. This inhibitor does not affect the O-2-evolution signal in air or the chlorophyll fluorescence induction pattern at high CO2, when nonsaturating light intensities are used. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that at least a major part of the CO2-stimulated photoacoustic uptake signal results from light-modulated CO2-solubilisation catalysed by carbonic anhydrase. Modulated CO2-solubilisation appears likely to be induced by light driven H+-translocation from the stroma into the thylakoid lumen. Comparison of the induction patterns of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching and the uptake signal suggests a correlation between membrane energisation and CO2-uptake. The importance of O-2-dependent electron flow as a major cause of membrane energisation is discussed. It is proposed that in the absence of CO2 the combination of Mehler- and ascorbate peroxidase reactions does not result in a photobaric signal, as O-2-uptake and O-2-evolution components cancel each other. Two main conclusions, which are of considerable importance for future practical applications of the photoacoustic method, are drawn from these findings: (1) When high CO2 is applied to leaves, the photobaric uptake component may provide a unique means of monitoring the function of stromal carbonic anhydrase in vivo. (2) Brief flushing of the photoacoustic cell with air may prevent the occurrence of an uptake signal, thus allowing a straight-forward deconvolution into photothermal and O-2-evolution components.									20	0	1	0	15	0	21			0166-8595			WOS:A1994PW97000008	24307469

This paper reports laminar flame properties: maximum combustion pressure (P-MAX), deflagration index (K-G) and laminar flame speed (SL degrees.) of H-2/O-2/N-2 mixtures over a wide range of initial conditions (XH2 = 0.1-0.6; N-2/O-2 = 0.66-9; T-ini =303-343K: P-ini= 50-100 kPa). This study was performed in a stainless steel spherical chamber (0.056 m(3) volume) equipped with an electric central ignition. A high speed imaging system is used to visualize the outward flame propagation and deduce SL degrees. The evolution of the pressure inside the vessel during the combustion is monitored. From this temporal evolution of the pressure, P-MAX and K-G are deduced. Laminar flame speeds were evaluated using 3 different detailed kinetic mechanisms from the literature [13-15]. The comparison between simulated and experimental values was used to select the most suitable one [15] to calculate the global activation energy of these mixtures. These simulations were performed using COSILAB (R). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Its transformation into valuable products or its use as an alternative source of energy has driven the search for selective catalysts. Herein we show first findings of perovskites as electrocatalysts for glycerol electrooxidation reaction (GEOR). Alternatively to Pt and Pd based catalyst, perovskite oxides (LaNiO3 and LaCoO3) demonstrated high catalytic performance with faradaic currents of ca. 18 mA mg-1 at potentials higher than 1.6 V vs. RHE. LaCoO3 exhibited resistance to poisoning during GEOR. Based on in situ FTIR and online HPLC experiments, GEOR on these perovskites yields formate and glycolate as final products, with no evidence of CO2 formation. Our results indicate that perovskites can be considered as alternative electrocatalysts for the selective oxidation of glycerol, opening the door for a new class of catalysts for polyols oxidation with efficiency in terms of current densities and poisoning resistance.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1572-6657	1873-2569		WOS:000696793500003

In order to achieve higher capacity through lithium extraction, higher cutoff voltages (>4.3 V) are applied on these materials. Consequently, the batteries will suffer from aggravated side reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface and the inherent instabilities of Ni-rich NCM cathodes, and thus exhibit rapid capacity fading and voltage decay. Herein, we report a facile and scalable strategy that employs Zr doping concurrent with LixZryOz surface coating, contributing to outstanding capacity retentions of 97.8% at 0.2C and 91.6% at 2C after 100 cycles over 2.8-4.5 V. The improved cycling stability can be attributed to the enhanced bulk stability and suppressed nonequilibrium diffusion reactions, which are further ascribed to the reduced oxygen vacancies and optimized microstructure.									15	3	0	0	0	0	17			2405-8297			WOS:000620382900003

Nano-scale surface properties of Ir/Pt(poly) catalysts were revealed by ex situ Atomic Force Microscopy imaging. Modified electrodes were characterized in situ electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry in 0.1 M KOH. Investigations of the methanol oxidation in the same alkaline solution showed that Ir/Pt(poly) electrode obtained after 1 minute Ir deposition, which is equivalent to 80% Ir coverage, showed improved activity with respect to both constitutive metals. The observed synergism on the methanol oxidation activity was ascribed to both bifunctional and electronic effects that are induced by the presence of spontaneously deposited Ir. The origin of the synergism and the possible methanol oxidation pathways were discussed on the basis of the activities of the Ir/Pt(poly) electrodes for the oxidation of the most probable reaction intermediates, CO and formaldehyde, in the same alkaline solution.									2	0	0	0	1	0	2			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000484777500056	31383115

It is shown that the ignition process can be divided into characteristic stages. But the inflection points in the time dependence of the particle temperature do not coincide with the stage boundaries and, hence, cannot be used for their identification. When determining the end of the heating stage analytically, it is better to associate it with a temperature that is lower than the inflection temperature by one characteristic interval. When considering the further heating of the particle during the chemical reaction, the mass transfer has to be taken into account. A new method for the analytical determination of the ignition time is proposed, which makes allowance for chemical reactions and the mass transfer that simultaneously run in the transition and diffusion combustion regions.									1	0	1	0	0	0	2			2071-0186	2071-0194		WOS:000495059700002

The growth process of Ir1-xVxO2 nanorods was performed by modulating the ratios of two precursors of VO2 and IrO2, the growth temperature, the position of metal oxide precursors in a furnace, and the flow rate of carrier gases. The results indicated that quasi one-dimensional nanostructures of Ir1-xVxO2 can be obtained of a single crystalline nature with the tetragonal rutile crystal structure by randomly incorporating Ir4+ and V4+ metal ions into the same lattice unit of the tetragonal structure owing to similar ionic sizes. In addition, the fundamental electrochemical performances for Ir1-xVxO2 nanorods grown directly on an Au microelectrode of 25 mu m in diameter were carefully tested in order to explore the nonenzymatic amperometric sensing capacity of ascorbic acid as a biologically important molecule.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1466-8033			WOS:000404285000010

In this work, we first design an asymmetric neutral-acidic electrolytic cell by coupling the silver oxidation reaction (AOR) in a neutral anode chamber with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acid cathode chamber. When the anode electrolyte contains a certain amount of chloride ions, AgCl particles can be steadily synthesized close to, but not in contact with, the silver electrode at a fixed voltage. This electrolytic cell requires a voltage of only 1.1 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2). In order to simplify the system and reduce the cost, a symmetric acid membrane-free electrolytic cell is designed; this cell requires a voltage of only 0.95 V to drive 10 mA cm(-2) and 1.37 V to drive 250 mA cm(-2) when a silver rod and graphite rod are used as the anode and cathode, respectively. Besides high purity H-2 generation at the cathode, the anode product is pure AgCl and its size can be controlled by changing the voltage. The Faraday efficiency is close to 95% for both H-2 and AgCl generation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000686583600001

Decorating a thin catalyst layer on the n-type silicon surface can provide a direct and effective route toward PEC water oxidation. However, most of catalyst immobilization methods for reported n-type silicon photoanodes have been based on energetically demanding, time-consuming, and high-cost processes. Herein, a high-performance NiFeP alloy (NiFeP)-decorated n-type micro-pyramid silicon array (n-Si) photoanode (NiFeP/n-Si) was prepared by a fast and low-cost electroless deposition method for light-driven water oxidation reaction. The saturated photocurrent density of NiFeP/n-Si can reach up to similar to 40 mA cm(-2) and a photocurrent density of 15.5 mA cm(-2) can be achieved at 1.23 V-RHE under light illumination (100 mW cm(-2), AM1.5 filter), which is one of the most promising silicon-based photoanodes to date. The kinetic studies showed that the NiFeP on the silicon photoanodes could significantly decrease the interfacial charge recombination between the n-type silicon surface and electrolyte.									21	0	0	0	4	0	21			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000526609100017	32056436

Explosion has been simulated in 13 of these and the final nucleosynthetic yields, including the nu-process, determined. Except for the products of the neutrino process (fluorine and boron), the presupernova abundances of isotopes lighter than about A = 40, closely resemble the final yields. These results, when incorporated into a model for Galactic chemical evolution that includes contributions from lower mass stars and Type Ia supernovae, give present day abundances that are in good agreement with those observed in the solar system when a particular choice is made for the C-12(alpha, gamma)O-16 reaction rate (S(300 keV) = 0.17 MeV barns). We find primary nitrogen is produced for zero metallicity stars whose mass is 30 M. or greater.

To meet the requirements of SACs with distinctive performance and appreciable selectivity, much research has been carried out to adjust the coordination configuration and electronic properties of SACs. This concept summarizes the latest advances in the experimental and computational efforts aimed at tuning the axial coordination of SACs. Series of atoms, functional groups or even macrocycles are oriented into the atomic metal center, and how this affects the electrocatalytic performance is also reviewed.

However, poor electrical conductivity and aggregation of flakes cause huge volume changes and reduce accessible active sites, leading to inferior cycle stability and rate performance. Hence, a NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2 MXene hybrid with uniformly distributed NiFe-LDH nanoflakes decorated on MXene nanosheets through a simple hydrothermal reaction is prepared. Due to the synergism between the Ti3C2 MXene conductive frameworks and NiFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2 MXene shows a superior electrochemical property for lithium storage. Its reversible capacity is 898.9 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), and even at 1 A g(-1), it still has 726.1 mAh g(-1), without capacity reduction in lithium-ion half-cells. In addition, the corresponding lithium-ion capacitor shows a higher energy density and power density, showing huge application prospect in lithium storage.									14	1	0	0	0	0	14			2574-0962			WOS:000688250200043

The critical pH of 12.5 was found for the conversion from pitting corrosion to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). OER was kinetically faster than pitting corrosion when both reactions could occur, and OER could postpone pitting corrosion. This resulted in pitting being initiated during the reversing scan in the cyclic polarization at the critical pH. According to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the content of Cr and Mo decreased with pH, while Fe content increased. This induced the degradation of the passive film, which resulted in the higher passive current densities under more alkaline conditions. The selective dissolution of Mo at high pH was found, which demonstrated that the addition of Mo in austenitic stainless steels might not be beneficial to the corrosion resistance of 316L in strong alkaline solutions.									24	7	0	0	0	0	26			1006-7191	2194-1289		WOS:000463780700006

This CdTe/CdS/FTO electrode was found to work as a photoanode with a long absorption edge wavelength of 830 nm. In a CdTe-based photoanode such as this, the p-n junction formed at the CdTe/CdS interface promotes charge separation of photoexcited carriers and forces photogenerated holes to move toward the photoanode surface to promote oxidation reactions on the electrode surface. A MoOx buffer layer was also found to play a crucial role in facilitating the transfer of photogenerated holes to surface reaction sites through decreasing the energy barrier at the interface between the CdTe and a surface protective layer. A biphotoelectrode photoelectrochemical cell composed of a CdTe-based photoanode and a CdTe-based photocathode exhibited a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 0.22% without an external voltage in response to illumination by AM 1.5G light.									16	0	0	0	1	0	16			1948-7185			WOS:000417671200005	29111744	
J	Tailoka, F; Fray, DJ								Chlorination of metallurgical residues with HCl derived from combustion of polyvinyl chloride								TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION C-MINERAL PROCESSING AND EXTRACTIVE METALLURGY				106				C115	C122						SEP-DEC 1997	1997	The kinetics of the combustion of scrap polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has been investigated with a view to determining conditions under which non-ferrous metals in metallurgical residues can be chlorinated in preference to iron. Thermogravimetric measurements show that the decomposition of scrap PVC is characterized by three weight-loss zones, the dominant of which is the evolution of HCl gas. At the lowest temperature tested the reaction was very slow, but it increased rapidly when the temperature was raised by 15K. The optimum temperature for combustion was between 520 and 600K. The concentration of all hydrocarbons not combusted was typically less than 100 ppm and neither dioxins nor furans were detected.Various metallurgical residues, including electric-arc furnace dust, basic oxygen steelmaking dust, blast-furnace hydrocyclone overflow, zinc-lead blast-furnace slags and zinc-copper-rich dusts, were chlorinated in excess air with HCl gas from PVC. Gas chromatography, thermogravimetric measurements, X-ray diffraction and atomic absorption spectrophotometry were used to study the reaction. The recovery of non-ferrous metals was as high as 80-90% and only a negligible amount of iron was carried over.									22	0	0	0	1	0	22			0371-9553			WOS:000078279900002

This material exhibits a structure of a Sn metallic ball coated with a nitrogen-doped SnOx native layer (N-doped SnOx@Sn) embedded on a carbon matrix. The carbon matrix originates from the CB and the polymeric CN decomposition promotes electrical conductivity, leading to high electrochemical activity of the CN-Sn catalyst. The introduction of nitrogen that occupies the interstitial space of the surface SnOx layer further enhances electron transport; furthermore, it provides an electron-rich environment for oxygen because of its lower electronegativity, which is the fundamental cause of selectivity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The maximum CO Faradaic efficiency over the optimal catalyst reaches 57.5%, with a high CO partial current density of 6.09 mA cm(-2) at -0.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. This catalyst is further applied to construct a photovoltaic-electrocatalytic CO2 reduction/oxygen evolution reaction device to stably convert CO2 to chemicals over 6 h at a high solar-to-fuel efficiency of 11.3%. This work explores a strategy of rational modulation on surface electronic structure to obtain high-performance electrocatalysts, inspiring the selectivity tuning in electrochemical CO2 reduction via electronegativity difference of various elements.									5	2	0	0	0	0	6			2367-198X			WOS:000529255800001

However, common approaches to the synthesis of these materials often require tedious procedures and lack appropriate interactions between the metal atoms and supports. Here, we report a simple and practical strategy to access the large-scale synthesis of single-atom catalysts via direct atoms emitting from bulk metals, and the subsequent trapping on nitrogen-rich porous carbon with the assistance of ammonia. First, the ammonia coordinates with the copper atoms to form volatile Cu(NH3)(x) species based on the strong Lewis acid-base interaction. Then, following transportation under an ammonia atmosphere, the Cu(NH3)(x) species are trapped by the defects on the nitrogen-rich carbon support, forming the isolated copper sites. This strategy is readily scalable and has been confirmed as feasible for producing functional single-atom catalysts at industrial levels.									502	43	0	0	37	0	506			2520-1158			WOS:000447080500013

For solutions containing chloride salts, we observed the formation of light-absorbing organic products ("brown carbon"), accompanied by a phase separation, within 10 h under dark conditions. Products were characterized at the molecular level using ultraperformance liquid chromatography interfaced to diode array detection and high resolutionquadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry equipped with electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization interfaced to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The ultraviolet-visible spectra, together with high-resolution mass spectra results, suggest that syringol can be oxidized by dissolved oxygen, and the presence of Cl- promotes this reaction. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of aerosol optical properties during aging, specifically the formation of aerosol brown carbon in biomass-burning plumes.									13	3	0	0	11	0	16			2472-3452			WOS:000436382500008		
J	Lv, Xincong; Yin, Shengming								CoP-embedded nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped mesoporous carbon nanotube for efficient hydrogen evolution								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				537						147834	10.1016/j.apsusc.2020.147834				JAN 30 2021	2021	Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through the electrochemical process at low overpotentials is vital for sustainable energy production. However, the fabrication of non-precious materials with high efficiency for the HER remains a challenge. Here, a new catalyst that consists of cobalt (Co) species embedded nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) co-doped carbon nanotubes (CNT) is fabricated by the polymerization of dopamine on the cobalt-nitrilotriacetic coordination polymer nanowire surface, followed by the phosphidation and carbonization under high temperature. After the pretreatment by potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the removal of metallic Co nanoparticles by sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the activated catalyst (A-Co/N,P-CNT-700) exhibits an overpotential of 44 mV to obtain 10 mA cm(-2) current density, approaching the value of commercial Pt/C catalyst (27 mV). The catalyst could easily maintain similar to 95% of its original HER activity after 15-hour stability test. The superior performance arises from the unique N-Co-P surface bonding states at the interface between CoP nanoparticles (1-4 nm) and N,P co-doped CNT. To the best of our knowledge, such HER performance is the best among noble metal free electrocatalysts in acidic electrolytes.									12	1	0	0	0	0	13			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582798700010

Despite the significant effect that Rubisco has on the fitness of plants and other photosynthetic organisms, this enzyme is known to have a low catalytic rate and a tendency to confuse its substrate, carbon dioxide, with oxygen. This apparent inefficiency is puzzling and raises questions regarding the roles of evolution versus biochemical constraints in shaping Rubisco. Here we examine these questions by analyzing the measured kinetic parameters of Rubisco from various organisms living in various environments. The analysis presented here suggests that the evolution of Rubisco is confined to an effectively one-dimensional landscape, which is manifested in simple power law correlations between its kinetic parameters. Within this one-dimensional landscape, which may represent biochemical and structural constraints, Rubisco appears to be tuned to the intracellular environment in which it resides such that the net photosynthesis rate is nearly optimal. Our analysis indicates that the specificity of Rubisco is not the main determinant of its efficiency but rather the trade-off between the carboxylation velocity and CO2 affinity. As a result, the presence of oxygen has only a moderate effect on the optimal performance of Rubisco, which is determined mostly by the local CO2 concentration. Rubisco appears as an experimentally testable example for the evolution of proteins subject both to strong selection pressure and to biochemical constraints that strongly confine the evolutionary plasticity to a low-dimensional landscape.									192	5	0	0	160	0	195			0027-8424			WOS:000275130900038	20142476

Here we present an overview of the role of adenosine in its most reactive form: as an organic radical formed either by homolytic cleavage of adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B-12, AdoCbl) or by single-electron reduction of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) complexed to an iron-sulfur cluster. Although many of the enzymes we discuss are newly discovered, adenosine's role as a radical cofactor most likely arose very early in evolution, before the advent of photosynthesis and the production of molecular oxygen, which rapidly inactivates many, radical enzymes. AdoCbl-dependent enzymes appear to be confined to a rather narrow repertoire of rearrangement reactions involving 1,2-hydrogen atom migrations; nevertheless, mechanistic insights gained from studying these enzymes have proved extremely valuable in understanding how enzymes generate and control highly reactive free radical intermediates. In contrast, there has been a recent explosion in the number of radical-AdoMet enzymes discovered that catalyze a remarkably wide range of chemically challenging reactions; here there is much still to learn about their mechanisms. Although all the radical-AdoMet enzymes so far characterized come from anaerobically growing microbes and are very oxygen sensitive, there is tantalizing evidence that some of these enzymes might be active in aerobic organisms including humans.									69	1	0	0	41	0	70			1439-4227	1439-7633		WOS:000276536000001	20191656

As the theoretical thermodynamics potential for carbon oxidation into CO2 is 0.21 V, the introduction of carbon is possible to reduce the power consumption for WE to 1/6. Herein, we adopt three kinds of microporous activated coke to study the electrochemical carbon oxidation reaction (ECOR) properties. Experimental and computational results demonstrate that carbon atoms located at edges and defects could be active sites in ECOR, whereas C=O groups generated after electro-oxidized inhibit the process of ECOR. Additionally, a new Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox-coupled hydrogen evolution reaction system is designed for WE. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage of 1.2 V to achieve a current density of 97 mA cm(-2) without any metal catalyst at the anode and the corresponding electricity consumption is 2.87 kWh Nm(-3) (H-2). These findings provide a promising strategy for low-cost, efficient H-2 production. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-1481	1879-0682		WOS:000822702200010

The sluggish process of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in air cathodes can be accelerated by introducing heteroatoms into carbon networks, due, most probably, to the improved electron and spin densities of carbon atoms, thus leading to the urgent demand of carbonaceous electrocatalysts. Here, N, S-codoped porous carbon materials are successfully prepared via the self-activation pyrolysis of garlic stems, and exhibit promising ORR activities and improved ZABs performances. GSC-900 shows onset and half-wave potentials of 0.89 and 0.80 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, and efficient 4 electrons pathway, resistance to methanol crossover effect and CO poison, as well as robust durability after 30,000 s tests in alkaline electrolyte solution. GSC-900 as air cathode in a primary ZABs illustrates 1.19 V discharge voltage at 10 mA cm(-2), and power density of 95 mW cm(-2), higher stability than commercial Pt/C. GSC-900 combined with FeCoOx served as bifunctional ORR/OER air-cathode illustrated robust stability in rechargeable ZABs. Turning the biowastes into value-added products not only contributes to the environmental sustainability, but also provides a rational yet low-cost route for the generation of ORR electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries or fuel cells.

The lack of fundamental understanding and practical issues such as potential secondary pollution, side reactions (e.g., hydrogen-evolution reaction), deficiency in catalytic activity, and/or stability have limited the adoption of EDH technology. Here, we address these problems by designing a palladium-based nanocatalyst with precise control of atomic vacancies to exploit the combination of direct and indirect EDH. Experimental and theoretical investigations show that atomic vacancies can promote electron transfer on the catalyst surface to enhance the generation/storage capacity of atomic hydrogen and to simultaneously facilitate dissociative electron transfer to C-Cl bond. Our work guides the design of atomic-vacancy-rich palladium-based electrocatalysts and provides a new strategy for efficient electro-dehalogenation in water and fundamental insights into the relationship of different dehalogenation mechanisms for accurate quantitative prediction.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4				2666-3864		WOS:000745651900004

The CoMn2O4/NPGA is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electrocatalytic activity of the CoMn2O4/NPGA composite towards the ORR was assessed using a linear sweep voltammetry method. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements show that the as-obtained CoMn2O4/NPGA shows excellent ORR activity in an alkaline medium comparable to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the ORR on CoMn2O4/NPGA proceeds through an almost four-electron pathway. Simultaneously, the methanol tolerance and operational stability of CoMn2O4/NPGA toward the ORR are prominently higher than those of commercial Pt/C. All these conspicuous properties suggest that our proposed CoMn2O4/NPGA may be used as a prospective Pt-free catalyst in alkaline direct methanol fuel cells.									17	1	0	0	1	0	17			2046-2069			WOS:000386242500001

However, in most cases, 1O2 plays a minor role in the Fenton-like process due to its low yield, the contributions of which are usually covered by free radicals. Here, we provide the first report on a type of hollow amorphous Co/C composites prepared for the efficient generation of 1O2 to degrade oxytetracycline (OTC) selectively in the Fenton-like system. The optimized Co/C samples (Co/C-3) obtained the best degradation performance of OTC near to 100% under neutral conditions, along with satisfactory reusability and stability. Additionally, it exhibited a high anti-interference capacity for inorganic anions and natural organic matters in the different water qualities. XPS spectrum revealed that the electron cycle of equivalent to Co2+-O-C/H and equivalent to Co3+-O-C/H played a vital effect on the formation of 1O2. Quenching experiments and EPR testing further verified that 1O2 converted from .O2- was the dominant oxidative species, and no hydroxyl radical (.OH) appeared in this reaction. Moreover, the results of the Fukui function and T.E.S.T (Toxicity Estimation Software Tool) analysis provided significant assistance in the exploration of degradation pathways and ecological risks of OTC and its intermediates.									28	0	0	0	9	0	28			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000664181900002

These nanosheets demonstrate superior photocatalytic activities for water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen and remain active with photon wavelengths as far as 600 nm. Their apparent quantum efficiency under visible-light illumination (lambda >= 420 nm) approaches 1.29% and 3.27% for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen production, being, almost 4-fold and 8-fold higher than bulk RbLaTa2O6.77N0.15. Their outstanding performance likely stems from their tiny thickness (single perovskite slab) that essentially removes bulk charge diffusion steps and extends the lifetime of photogenerated charges. Theoretical calculations reveal a peculiar 2D charge transportation phenomenon in RbLaTa2O6.77N0.15; thus, exfoliating RbLaTa2O6.77N0.15 into LaTa2O6.77N0.15- nanosheets has limited impact on charge transportation properties but significantly enhances the surface areas which contributes to more reaction sites.									73	4	0	0	3	0	72			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000416878100090	29091415	
J	Sahrling, M; Chabrier, G								The effect of electron gas polarization on thermonuclear reaction rates in dense stars								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				493	2			879	883		10.1086/305132				FEB 1 1998	1998	In dense stars the nuclear reaction rates are influenced by screening effects arising from both ions and electrons. In this paper we calculate the enhancement factors due to electron polarization in the high-density, degenerate and relativistic regime, for nonresonant nuclear reaction rates. In an earlier analysis, Sahrling had proposed the possibility that the polarized electrons would lower the reaction rate instead of enhancing it. This analysis was based on Monte Carlo simulations with only one choice of density, temperature, and charge. Here we extend the analysis to a wider range of densities, temperatures, and charges and calculate analytical expressions for the enhancement factors. We concentrate on carbon and oxygen ions and show that at very high densities high order quantum effects will be important and act to reduce the zeroth-order classical value for the enhancement factor. We show that, in any case, the total electron contribution remains weak, namely, an enhancement in the reaction of about a factor 2, contrary to what had been claimed by some authors in previous calculations. We examine the astro-physical implications of these results on the final stages of massive white dwarfs near the carbon-ignition curve.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0004-637X			WOS:000071911700033		
J	Swiler, TP; Loehman, RE								Molecular dynamics simulations of reactive wetting in metal-ceramic systems								ACTA MATERIALIA				48	18-19			4419	4424		10.1016/S1359-6454(00)00228-7				DEC 1 2000	2000	We have simulated the wetting of sapphire by aluminum using the ES+ potential. This potential is unique among empirical potentials because it applies a combination of the embedded atom method (EAM) and Coulomb potentials on a system of atoms with defined electronegativities so that the atom charges as well as the interatomic forces and system energies found by typical empirical potentials can be determined. Because we do not have to specify atom bond character a priori, we can directly model reactive wetting where atoms from the metal droplet may replace cations in the ceramic substrate and undergo the appropriate change from metallic to ionic bonding. Also, by using this empirical potential, we can simulate large dynamic systems that cannot be simulated by first-principles methods, albeit with some loss in detail and accuracy.In our simulations of high-temperature wetting we observe the formation of an oxygen-deficient reaction layer between the liquid and the substrate. The driving force for the creation of this layer is the partial oxidation of the metallic aluminum, which results in partial reduction of the aluminum ions in the substrate and diffusion of oxygen from the substrate to the reaction layer. We believe that this change in stoichiometry at the metal-ceramic interface may influence diffusivities in the surface of the ceramic and may therefore have an important effect on the kinetics of the evolution of surface features observed experimentally during reactive wetting.

However, it remains challenging due to the lack of efficient electrocatalysts for practical utilization. Herein, we investigate the synergistic effect between asymmetric Cu-Ov-W sites (Ov represents oxygen vacancy) and adjacent Mo clusters in tuning the local electronic environment around active sites of catalysts for substantially enhanced nitrate reduction. The dynamic balance between the adsorption and desorption of O in NO3 - caused by asymmetric Ov and the promoted protonation process due to Mo clusters are responsible for boosting the entire process. Such synergistic effect modulates the local electronic environment for binding the reaction intermediates and dramatically facilitates the intermediate formation in rate-determining steps (*NO ->*NOH and *NOH ->*N), leading to the high NH3 Faradaic efficiency and yield rate of 94.60% and 5.84 mg h-1 mgcat. - 1 at 0.7 V vs. RHE, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000805856800001

Thus, Li2MnO3 was dynamic and isothermally tested under different CO2 or CO atmospheres. This ceramic exhibited excellent CO oxidation and subsequent chemisorption properties under reductive atmospheres, while CO2 or CO in oxygen presence were not trapped. Li2MnO3 is the first lithium-containing ceramic reported for a selective CO sorption, in reductive atmospheres, which would be of great interest in different physicochemical processes. In fact, the CO-Li2MnO3 system evolution showed that o-LiMnO2 is produced as an intermediate crystalline phase. Based on that, o-LiMnO2 was analyzed to complement the CO chemisorption analysis. The whole atypical and unique reaction path was evidenced and supported by different structural and chemical analysis performed on the isothermal products, where lithium diffusion and reactivity with CO is performed through partial Mn reduction, allowing oxygen release for CO oxidation to form CO2 which can be captured. Moreover, isothermal data was kinetically analyzed and fitted to the Jander-Zhang mathematical model. Finally, cyclic CO oxidation-carbonation and decarbonation on Li2MnO3 showed interesting efficiencies, which however would be enhanced. Hence, Li2MnO3 presents interesting properties as CO oxidant and captor material, in nonoxidative conditions.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000724823400002

The porosities, heteroatoms contents, and crystalline structures of the final electrocatalysts were determined by the types of salts and the calcining temperatures. When KCl/NaCl, KCl/LiCl, and NaCl/CaCl2 were adopted as the molten salts, Co9S8 NPs embedded, N, S co-doped carbons were obtained. However, when CaCl2 and ZnCl2 were used as the molten salts, Co9S8 could not be synthesized. The characterization results exhibited that alkali metal atoms could be introduced in the lattices of Co9S8. The combination of experimental and theoretical results revealed that Na and K atoms doping improved the electrocatalytic performance for HER. GTCo900-KCl/NaCl possessed the best HER activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at 54 mV in acidic media, 142 mV in neutral media, and 103 mV in alkaline media.

Herein, a sea urchin-shaped cobalt-embedded N-doped carbon nanotubes (Co@NCNT) encapsulated CoPt3@Co2P heterojunction (CoPt3@Co2P/Co@NCNT) is fabricated. Theoretical calculations confirm that electrons at the interfaces transfer from CoPt3 to Co2P, where electron hole region on CoPt3 is beneficial to improving the MOR activity, whereas accumulation region on Co2P favors to the optimization of H2O and H* absorption energies for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefitting from its interfacial electronic reconfiguration, the CoPt3@Co2P/Co@NCNT heterojunction exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performances for MOR and HER, in which the mass activity (2981 mA mg(Pt)(-1)) for MOR is 14.2 times than that of Pt/C (20%), and the smallest overpotentials only requires 19 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) for HER. Moreover, the electrolyzer employing CoPt3@Co2P/Co@NCNT for anodic MOR and cathodic H-2 production only requires a low voltage of 1.43 V at 10 mA cm(-2) with impressive long-life cycling stability, which is obviously better than that of commercial Pt/C//RuO2. This study offers a novel strategy for other organics oxidation reaction coupled with HER catalyzed production of hydrogen.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000714813200001	34741432

Here, self-supported Cu-Ni-Al hybrid electrodes that are composed of electro-active Al7Cu4Ni@Cu4Ni core/shell nanocrystals seamlessly integrated in self-supported 3D bimodal nanoporous Cu skeleton (Bi-NP Cu/Al7Cu4Ni@Cu4Ni) as robust HER electrocatalysts in alkaline electrolyte are reported. As a result of the proper architecture, in which the Bi-NP Cu skeleton not only facilitates both electron and electrolyte transports but also provides high specific surface areas to fully use high electrocatalytic activity of Al7Cu4Ni@Cu4Ni core/shell nanocrystals, the Bi-NP Cu/Al7Cu4Ni@Cu4Ni hybrid catalysts exhibit a low onset overpotential of 60 mV and a small Tafel slope of 110 mV dec(-1), enabling the catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 139 mV. The highly stable electrochemical performance makes them promising candidates as cathode catalysts in alkaline-based devices.									63	6	0	0	3	0	64			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000429410400011

Recent efforts have proposed that OH, as well as H, must bind optimally for improved kinetics, but the exact role of adsorbed OH is not yet known. In this work, we combine steady-state single-crystal voltammetry and microkinetic modeling to determine the roles of adsorbed hydroxide and the so-called bifunctional mechanism in alkaline HER and HOR kinetics. We consider both a direct Volmer mechanism, in which H and OH compete for sites on Pt (110), and an OH-mediated mechanism, in which Pt (111) adsorbs H while transition metal clusters adsorb OH. Our experimental and computational results show that on a thermodynamic coverage basis, increasing OH adsorption strength cannot promote faster HER/HOR kinetics. Only changes to the kinetic rate constants can explain experimental observations. We speculate that adequate electrocatalyst design in alkaline media additionally requires manipulation of interfacial water structure to lower energetic barriers for HER and HOR.

The operating regime and turbulence characteristics are chosen to resemble those of a modern methane rocket combustor. Local flame characteristics and dimensionless numbers are defined and evaluated, and their relationship with the turbulent kinetic energy transport budget is studied. Positive net turbulence generation is observed in the reaction shear layer. It is found that the underlying mechanisms for these results are similar to those encountered in premixed flames, with pressure terms acting as the primary turbulent kinetic energy sources. Models for predicting turbulent transport through mean pressure gradients, fluctuating pressure gradients, and turbulent flux of turbulent kinetic energy are adapted. The accuracy of the proposed formulations is assessed, and the involved challenges are discussed. (C) 2022 Author(s).									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1070-6631	1089-7666		WOS:000869196400001

Treatment of Mn-depleted PSII membranes by EDC in the presence of nucleophiles induced a loss of photoactivation capability in the Mn complex and partial loss of capability of photooxidation of Mn2+, but little decrease in the DCIP photoreduction supported by diphenylcarbazide. The inhibition of diphenylcarbazide-photooxidation by submicromolar Mn2+, indicative of the intactness of high-affinity Mn-binding sites, was apparently abolished by EDC treatment. From amino acid quantitation analysis of D1 and D2 proteins and CP47 of the chemically-modified membranes, approximately three carboxyl groups of the D1 protein were found to be chemically-modified with EDC after removal of the functional Mn. These results suggest that acidic amino acids on the D1 protein are involved in photoactivation of the ape-water-oxidizing complex and probably in ligation of Mn to the water-oxidizing complex.									18	2	0	0	15	0	18			0032-0781			WOS:A1997XA53500011

On the basis of an interface self-assembly approach, we synthesize mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon/Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide nanohybrids (denoted as mNC-Mo2C@rGO), which represent a new type of two-dimensional Mo2C/carbon hybrid nanomaterials and possess a sandwichlike structure with well-defined mesopores. The method involves the co-self-assembly of spherical micelles formed from polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide), pyrrole (Py) monomers, and molybdate ions (Mo7O246-) on GO surfaces in aqueous solution, followed by polymerization of Py and calcination of the nanocomposites at 900 degrees C under nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant mNCMo(2)C@rGO nanosheets possess high N contents, large specific surface areas (SSAs), and 4 nm Mo2C particles well-distributed in the mesoporous carbon matrix. The Mo2C content is controllable in the range of 18.4-42.4 wt % by adjusting the feed amount of Mo7O246-. In particular, mNC-Mo2C@rGO with an SSA of 344 m(2)/g and a Mo2C content of ca. 28 wt % exhibits the highest HER catalytic activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte, with a 95 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm(2), a Tafel slope of 49.8 mV/ dec, and a long-term stability of 60 h at 20 mA/cm(2).

Thermoincluced inhibition of the liner electron flow due to partial impairment of the water oxidizing complex (WOC) and the increase in the extent of Q(A)(-) reoxidation by Tyr(z)(ox) in thylakoids isolated from 4-day-old leaves was shown by measurements of oxygen evolution using benzoquinone or potassium ferricyanide as electron acceptors, as well as by following Q(A)(-) reoxidation kinetics in the absence and presence of exogenous electron acceptors, DCBQ and DMBQ. Using HPLC analysis, an increase in the oxidation of the photoactive plastoquinone pool in young leaves under heating was shown. In older, 11-day-old leaves, heat treatment limited both photosynthetic electron flow and oxygen evolution. The same effects of heat shock on oxygen evolution caused an inhibition of electron flow on the donor side of PSII only. However, a rise in the proportion of PSII with Q(A)(-) reoxidized through recombination with the S-2/S-3 state of the WOC was observed. The addition of exogenous electron acceptors (DCBQ and DMBQ) and a donor (DPC) showed that the thermoincluced decrease in the electron transport rate was caused by an impediment of electron flow from Q-A to acceptor pool. The decrease in size of the photoactive PQ-pool and a change in the proportions of oxidized and reduced PQ in older leaves under heat treatment were shown. It was suggested that a thermoinduced change of the redox state of the PQ-pool and a redistribution of plastoquinone molecules between photoactive and non-photoactive pools are the mechanisms which reflect and regulate the response of the photosynthetic apparatus under heat stress conditions.

A two-step method is employed to obtain metal clusters (Ru, N, Pd etc.) combining single cobalt atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru/Pt/Pd@Co-SAs/N-C). Based on the synergistic effect between Ru clusters and single cobalt atoms, Ru@Co-SAs/N-C exhibits an outstanding HER electrocatalytic activity. Specifically, Ru@Co-SAs/N-C only needs 7 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH solution, which is much better than commercial 20 wt% PVC (40 mV) catalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the synergy effect between surface Ru nanoclusters and Co-SAs/N-C toward hydrogen adsorption for HER.

Coupled atop p-type Si, this catalyst performed as a p-n heterojunction photocathode assembly and the performance varied when under different electrolyte media. Apart from changing the surface morphology, Ni2P was crystallized with an increase in the Ni delta+/Ni2+ ratio as the phosphidation temperature gradually increased. A systematic evaluation of the water splitting reaction shows that a very small amount of catalyst (>85% transmittance for the catalyst layer) exhibits a photocurrent of -10 mA cm(-2 )with a positive applied potential of 0.05 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under simulated solar irradiation of AM 1.5G. We discuss the substantial charge transfer process at the depletion layer of the electrode/catalyst and the catalyst/electrolyte interface. Mott-Shottky analysis showed a shift in the flat band potential for Ni2P, which reveals the underlying mechanism for the role of the p-n junction for enhanced photoelectrochemical cell performance.

In this work, nanoporous active W foils (NPAWFs) are prepared via two-step anodizing and deoxidized annealing in hydrogen atmosphere. During the course of this research, the anodizing and annealing conditions have been optimized systematically. The morphology, composition and catalytic property of as-prepared NPAWFs have been characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, x-ray diffraction and electrochemical measurements. The final results show that a reduction in the anodizing voltage from 60 V for 60 min to 40 V for 60 min causes better growth of nanoporous structure, and the deoxidation at 700 degrees C for 3 h can remove oxygen in the nanoporous layer while retaining the nanoporous structure and activity. Compared with non-treated W foil, the NPAWF exhibits superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with a low onset overpotential of 199 mV and Tafel slope of 84 mV dec(-1) due to its nanoporous structure and large specific surface area. Additionally, the NPAWF shows outstanding long-term stability in acidic media, indicating it is a promising transition metal HER electrocatalyst and can also be used as a high active matrix material.									8	1	0	0	0	0	8			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000448702300001	30370900

It was shown that under conditions of industrial application in the "zero-gap" membrane cells the lowest over-voltage for HER has been recorded for the Ni-MoO2 coating. At the same time the "service life" test was performed on all three electrodes in the same solution. This test was based on monitoring the current density response before and after repetitive cycling of these electrodes with 50 mV s(-1) in the potential range from hydrogen (-1.25 V vs. SCE) to oxygen (0.50 V vs. SCE) evolution. It was shown that the activity for all electrodes at the end of a "service life" test dropped to approximately 54% of the initial value, being comparable with the results obtained for Pt-based cathodes. The SEM-EDS analysis of the electrodes after the "service life" test showed that the Ni-MoO2 is much more stable than the Ni-MoOx composite coating and could be promising replacement for the commercial cathode.

The synthesized NiFe2O4@TiO2 samples were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), magnetic and photocatalytic measurements. Unexpectedly, the reduction reaction does not produce oxygen vacancies O-v and TiOx in the TiO2 lattice. The optimal catalyst was obtained at the reducing temperature of 800 degrees C, and its degradation efficiency D-e to the methylene blue and reaction rate constant K-app are the highest, reaching 99.9% and 3x10(-2) min(-1), respectively. The reason could not be explained by both the visible light absorption and the appropriate amount of O-v and TiOx. Instead, the lowest ratios of TiOH and Ti-O-Fe(Ni) may be responsible for the optimum photocatalytic performance.									2	1	0	0	0	0	2			1000-2413	1993-0437		WOS:000531154300009

In this article, we classify the gold bimetallic catalysts into Au-BM and Au-PGM, based on the chemical properties of the second metal, where BM refers to base metals (Ag, Cu, Ni, Co, etc.) that are characterized by their pronounced effect in promoting oxygen activation in gold-catalyzed oxidation reactions, while PGM refers to platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, etc.) that are characterized by their remarkable effect in promoting Hy dissociation in gold-catalyzed hydrogenation reactions. The preparation of catalysts with controlled size and composition, their structural evolution under different atmospheres, and the promotional role of the second metal in gold catalysis have been addressed.

Although hydrogen has potential applications in heating, transportation, mechanical power, and electricity generation, it suffers from the problems of storing and transporting in compressed and liquefied from because of its low density. The development of suitable catalyst with high catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution from hydrolysis process has triggered considerable research interest over the past decades. Nano diamond has recently received tremendous attention due to its superior thermal conductivity, chemical inertness, and electrical insulating properties. Nano-diamond surfaces have a wide variety of oxygen having groups including hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. These functionalities aid the attachment of Nano-diamond with photocatalyst without any stabilization. For that merit, incorporation of Nano-diamond into photocatalytic system is expected to improve the catalytic activities and stability of photocatalyst through restraining the catalyst agglomeration.

However, the selectivity control towards high energy value products, such as methane or methanol, is one of the main issues of this process due to the easier formation of CO, which requires fewer electrons to be transferred, and the competition of hydrogen evolution reaction. In this work, a new LDH material containing Ni, Ti and Al within the structure was synthesised with the purpose of increasing the selectivity towards methane production. The material was tested under solar simulator conditions, yielding a methane production of 148 mu mol g-1 h-1, with a selectivity of 86%, one of the highest values reported for this kind of material, while the competition from hydrogen evolution was almost suppressed. The role of Ti directing the selectivity towards methane was confirmed, since no CH4 was produced when NiAl-LDH catalyst was used instead. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

When anerobic RAS conditioning is initially imposed on a nitrifying system, Nitrobacter species continue to oxidize nitrite to nitrate and thus reduce the nitrite available to oxidize BOD. However, Nitrobacter in the mixed liquor gradually tend to wash out because the sole source of Nitrobacter energy, the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate, is diminished to the extent that nitrite is reduced.Incorporation of an RAS conditioning zone to the activated-sludge process results in evolution of a nonfilamentous biomass, which affects both cocurrent biological nitrification and denitrification (CBND) and biological phosphorus removal (BPR). The initial feed zone may be either aerobic or anaerobic. A final anoxic denitrification zone is desirable for removal of residual nitrite plus nitrate (NOx) from aeration effluent. Nitrous oxide, the main reaction product of CBND, promotes both global warming and destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer.									10	0	0	0	5	1	10			1061-4303	1554-7531		WOS:000077832800003

The evolution of the oxide layer was monitored by following the nickel and zirconium XPS peaks after exposure to an oxygen pressure of 10(-5) mbar for various periods. The surface of the air-exposed films is characterized as ZrO2 even for bulk nickel concentrations over 80 at.%. After sputter cleaning, oxidation at room temperature under controlled oxygen exposure results in a several-stage oxidation towards ZrO2 accompanied by a systematic depletion of the nickel at the surface. This reaction saturates after exposures of the order of several thousand Langmuirs. Throughout this process, nickel remains primarily in a metallic state. There is, moreover, indirect transport evidence that a non-surface nickel-rich layer is produced.					7TH INTERNATIONAL CONF ON RAPIDLY QUENCHED MATERIALS7TH INTERNATIONAL CONF ON RAPIDLY QUENCHED MATERIALS	AUG 13-17, 1990AUG 13-17, 1990	ALLIED SIGNAL; VACUUMSCHMELZE; SANDVIK; MATERIAL CENTER; SWEDISH NATL BOARD TECH DEV; ROYAL INT TECHNOL; CITY STOCKHOLM; STOCKHOLM COUNTY COUNCILALLIED SIGNAL; VACUUMSCHMELZE; SANDVIK; MATERIAL CENTER; SWEDISH NATL BOARD TECH DEV; ROYAL INT TECHNOL; CITY STOCKHOLM; STOCKHOLM COUNTY COUNCIL	STOCKHOLM, SWEDENSTOCKHOLM, SWEDEN	3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0921-5093			WOS:A1991FH74000039

Given that IF accumulated on the seafloor for over two billion years of Earth's early history, changes in their chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic compositions offer a unique glimpse into environmental changes that took place on the evolving Earth. Perhaps one of the most significant events was the transition from an anoxic planet to one where oxygen was persistently present within the marine water column and atmosphere. Linked to this progressive global oxygenation was the evolution of aerobic microbial metabolisms that fundamentally influenced continental weathering processes, the supply of nutrients to the oceans, and, ultimately, diversification of the biosphere and complex life forms. Many of the key recent innovations in understanding IF genesis are linked to geobiology, since biologically assisted Fe(II) oxidation, either directly through photoferrotrophy, or indirectly through oxygenic photosynthesis, provides a process for IF deposition from mineral precursors. The abundance and isotope composition of Fe(II)-bearing minerals in IF additionally suggests microbial Fe(III) reduction, a metabolism that is deeply rooted in the Archaea and Bacteria. Linkages among geobiology, hydrothermal systems, and deposition of IF have been traditionally overlooked, but now form a coherent model for this unique rock type. This paper reviews the defining features of IF and their distribution through the Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic. This paper is an update of previous reviews by Bekker et al. (2010, 2014) that will improve the quantitative framework we use to interpret IF deposition. In this work, we also discuss how recent discoveries have provided new insights into the processes underpinning the global rise in atmospheric oxygen and the geochemical evolution of the oceans.									197	11	0	0	28	0	204			0012-8252	1872-6828		WOS:000412257300008

Spectra analysis showed that VO2 can be grown at a relatively low temperature, T similar to 523 K, and that V2O5 oxide develops rapidly at elevated oxygen pressure. Raman spectroscopy was applied to confirm the formation of VO2 oxide inside of the film. In addition, the temperature-dependent resistivity measurement on the grown thin film, e.g., 20 nm exhibited a desirable metal-insulator transition of VO2 with a resistivity change of similar to 1.5 x 10(3) times at 349.3 K, displaying typical characteristics of thick VO2 film, e.g., 100 nm thick. Our results not only provide important spectroscopic information for the fabrication of vanadium oxides, but also show that high quality VO2 films can be formed at relatively low temperature, which is highly critical for engineering oxide film for heat-sensitive electronic devices.

Its basal plane exhibits high catalytic activity comparable to the edges in 2H MoS2 and noble metal platinum. However, the production and application of this polymorph are limited by its lower energetic stability compared to the semiconducting 2H MoS2 phase. Here, the production of stable intercalated 1T ' MoS2 nanosheets attached on graphitic nanoribbons is reported. The intercalated 1T ' MoS2 exhibits a stoichiometric S:Mo ratio of 2.3 (+/- 0.1):1 with an expanded interlayer distance of 10 angstrom caused by a sulfur-rich intercalation agent and is stable at room temperature for several months even after drying. The composition, structure, and catalytic activity toward HER are investigated both experimentally and theoretically. It is concluded that the 1T ' MoS2 phase is stabilized by the intercalated agents, which further improves the basal planes ' catalytic activity toward HER.									56	3	0	0	6	0	56			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000449887300019

Although the phenomenon is correlated with relatively small increases in sea-surface temperature and enhanced light intensity, the underlying physiological mechanism remains unknown. In this article we demonstrate that thylakoid membrane lipid composition is a key determinate of thermal-stress sensitivity in symbiotic algae of cnidarians. Analyses of thylakoid membranes reveal that the critical threshold temperature separating thermally tolerant from sensitive species of zooxanthellae is determined by the saturation of the lipids. The lipid composition is potentially diagnostic of the differential nature of thermally induced bleaching found in scleractinian corals. Measurements of variable chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic transients indicate that thermally damaged membranes are energetically uncoupled but remain capable of splitting water. Consequently, a fraction of the photosynthetically produced oxygen is reduced by photosystem I through the Mehler reaction to form reactive oxygen species, which rapidly accumulate at high irradiance levels and trigger death and expulsion of the endosymbiotic algae. Differential sensitivity to thermal stress among the various species of Symbiodinium seems to be distributed across all clades. A clocked molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolutionary history of symbiotic algae in cnidarians selected for a reduced tolerance to elevated temperatures in the latter portion of the Cenozoic.									454	5	1	0	428	0	461			0027-8424			WOS:000223917900026	15340154

Two adsorption sites were observed for ethanol, a chemisorbed species identified as an ethoxide species, and a hydrogen-bonded species. The Ti-bound ethoxide was found to be the more photocatalytically reactive species. C-13 magic-angle spinning (MAS) experiments revealed that long-lived intermediates, including acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), acetic acid, formic acid, and acetate were observed under dry conditions and in the presence of molecular oxygen. Similar reaction intermediates form on the surfaces of both catalysts. C-13 cross-polarization MAS experiments allowed us to identify and follow the evolution of surface-bound species during W irradiation. Acetate, which forms from mobile acetic acid, appears to be bound to the non-irradiated surfaces of the powdered TiO2 catalyst, and was also observed on the surface of TiO2/PVG catalyst, and further degradation was not possible. The presence of molecular oxygen was found to be essential for photooxidation to proceed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the most important challenges in enhancing the performance of such systems is establishing efficient charge transfer between photocatalyst particles that are often thickly stacked on the conductive layer. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is investigated as an additional solid mediator to the conductive layer to bridge particulate photocatalysts and thus ensure effective charge transfer. Photocatalyst sheets made of RhCrOx/LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N as the HEP and BiVO4: Mo as the OEP are applied to an Au layer together with RGO. The activity of this system is 3.5 times greater following the incorporation of the RGO. Charaterization analyses reveal that RhCrOx/LaMg1/3Ta2/3O2N particles tens of nanometers in size are fixed on larger, micrometer-sized, BiVO4:Mo particles by RGO photoreduced from GO in situ. The RGO facilitates charge transfer between particles that are distant from the underlying Au layer and thus involves more photocatalyst particles in the water splitting reaction. It is concluded that the incorporation of conductive materials into the photocatalyst particle layer can effectively enhance the water splitting activity of photocatalyst sheets.									42	3	0	0	3	0	43			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000386159300016

Herein, in order to create many more electrocatalytic active sites, a facile approach combining Ar plasma pretreatment and subsequent N, S co-doping is presented. As a freestanding and binder-free electrocatalyst, the Ar-plasma-pretreated and N, S co-doped 3DGF (3DGF-Ar-NS) demonstrates significantly enhanced HER performance: the Tafel slope of 3DGF-Ar-NS dramatically decreases from 182 mV/dec (3DGF) to 75 mV/dec. The excellent HER performance and long-term stability of 3DGF-Ar-NS can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the 3DGF skeleton, Ar plasma pretreatment and heteroatom doping: the conductive, porous and flexible 3D graphene skeleton provides the interconnected conductive paths and facilitates the charge transportation; the Ar plasma pretreatment and N, S co-doping effectively create many more electrocatalytic active sites, resulting in significant enhancement in HER performance. This work provides a facile strategy to tailor and enhance the electrocatalytic performances of carbon-based materials for hydrogen evolution applications.

Because of the unique architecture with ultrathin and porous nanosheets of the Co1.2Ni1.8O4 shell, this composite exhibits better electrochemical performance than the pristine Mn2O3. Remarkably, it shows excellent methanol tolerance, even in a high concentration solution. The DMFC was assembled with Mn2O3@Co1.2Ni1.8O4, polymer fiber membranes, and PtRu/C as the cathode, membrane, and anode, respectively. The power densities of 57.5 and 70.5 mW cm(-2) were recorded at 18 and 28 degrees C, respectively, especially the former is the best result reported in the literature at such a low temperature. The stability of the Mn2O3@Co1.2Ni1.8O4 catalyzed cathode was evaluated, and the results show that this compound possesses excellent stability in a high methanol concentration. The improved electrochemical activity could be attributed to the narrow band gap of the hybrid, which accelerates the electrons jumping from the valence band to the conduction band. Therefore, Mn-III could be oxidized into Mn-IV more easily, simultaneously providing an electron to the absorbed oxygen.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000428356800034	29494130

Compared with pure Al:STO, the POWS activity was enhanced by a factor of similar to 421 over 1.0%CoP/Al:STO, with the highest evolution rates of 2106 and 1002 lmol h(-1) g(-1) for H-2 and O-2, respectively. The mechanism for the remarkably boosted POWS activity was systematically analyzed based on the comprehensive characterization. On the one hand, benefiting from the in situ photodeposition process, CoP with metallic character were intimately decorated onto the surface of Al:STO and accelerated the separation and migration of photoinduced charge carriers. On the other hand, CoP, serving as reactive sites for H-2 evolution reaction, lowered the overpotential and facilitated the surface reduction reaction, thereby enhancing the POWS activity. Furthermore, Cr2O3 was photodeposited on the surface of 1.0%CoP/Al:STO composite to suppress the undesired reverse reaction and the POWS activity was further enhanced up to 3558 and 1722 lmol h(-1) g(-1) for H-2 and O-2, respectively, with apparent quantum yield of 7.1% at 350 +/- 10 nm. This work presents a new avenue for designing POWS system without noble-metal cocatalyst.

Nevertheless, a critical issue limiting their practical application is corrosion of aluminum (Al) anode in an alkaline aqueous electrolyte, which results from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To effectively solve the corrosion issue, dissolution of Al anode should be carried out in a nonaqueous electrolyte. However, the main cathodic reaction, known as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), is sluggish in such a nonaqueous electrolyte. A dual-electrolyte configuration with an anion exchange membrane separator allows AABs to implement a nonaqueous anolyte along with an aqueous catholyte. Thus, this work addresses the issue of anode corrosion in an alkaline Al-air flow battery via a dual-electrolyte system. The battery configuration consisted of an Al anode | anolyte | anion exchange membrane | catholyte | air cathode. The anolytes were methanol solutions containing 3 M potassium hydroxide (KOH) with different ratios of water. An aqueous polymer gel electrolyte was used as the catholyte. The corrosion of Al in the anolytes was duly investigated. The increase of water content in the anolyte reduced overpotential and exhibited faster anodic dissolution kinetics. This led to higher HER, along with a greater corrosion rate. The performance of the battery was also examined. At a discharge current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), the battery using the anolyte without water exhibited the highest specific capacity of 2328 mAh/g(Al), producing 78% utilization of Al. At a higher content of water, a higher discharge voltage was attained. However, due to greater HER, the specific capacity of the battery decreased. Besides, the circulation rate of the anolyte affected the performance of the battery. For instance, at a higher circulation rate, a higher discharge voltage was attained. Overall, the dual-electrolyte system proved to be an effective approach for suppressing anodic corrosion in an alkaline Al-air flow battery and enhancing discharge capacity.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12				1996-1073		WOS:000535739300153

Input stellar yields for neutron-rich nuclei have been separated into their s-process and r-process components. The production of s-process elements in thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operation of two neutron sources: the dominant reaction C-13(alpha, n)O-16, which releases neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase, and the reaction Ne-22(alpha, n)Mg-25, marginally activated during thermal instabilities. The resulting s-process distribution is strongly dependent on the stellar metallicity. For the standard model discussed in this paper, there is a sharp production of the Ba-peak elements around Z similar or equal to Z(.)/4. Concerning the r-process yields, we assume that the production of r-nuclei is a primary process occurring in stars near the lowest mass limit for Type II supernova progenitors. The r-contribution to each nucleus is computed as the difference between its solar abundance and its s-contribution, given by the Galactic chemical evolution model at the epoch of the formation of the solar system. We compare our results with spectroscopic abundances of elements from Ba to Eu at various metallicities (mainly from F and G stars), showing that the observed trends can be understood in the light of present knowledge of neutron capture nucleosynthesis. Finally, we discuss a number of emerging features that deserve further scrutiny.									238	10	0	0	0	1	242			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000082017800024

Herein, ruthenium doped carbon nitride (CNRu) was synthesized via a facile one-pot method, and CNRu was in form of Ru-N2 that could efficiently activate PMS for DCF degradation and detoxification via nonradical pathway. DCF was completely removed within 10 min under the optimized condition in a wide working pH range of 3.00-9.00, while other traditional transition metals (e.g. Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) doped CN showed negligible removal of DCF due to adsorption rather than activation of PMS, which was demonstrated by DFT calculations. CNRu showed high stability and reusability after seven cycles and very few Ru leaching was detected in DCF degradation process. Ru was highly dispersed in form of Ru-N bond via coordinating to pyridine nitrogen, and the electron defect transfer between Ru and coordinated N, rather than redox cycle of Ru, mediated superoxide radicals (O2 center dot- ) evolution, which was further hydrolyzed into singlet oxygen (1O2) and responsible for DCF removal. Thus, the CNRu/PMS system showed high tolerance to inorganic anions. Much lower toxic intermediates/products than DCF were obtained via the strong electrophilic attack reaction between 1O2 and DCF in CNRu/PMS system. This study displayed a new practical application prospect of ruthenium-based materials for high-efficient removal and detoxification of DCF from wastewater.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000740946900001

Their oxygen evolution kinetics, cell voltage, and deposited zinc quality in an electrolyte solution of 65 g.L-1 Zn2+ and 150g.L-1 H2SO4 at 35 degrees C were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, anode polarization curve, galvanostatic electrolysis, scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The results show the PANI/CeO2/WC anode exhibited reduced over potential for oxygen evolution (0.896 Vat 500 A.m(-2)), highest electrocatalytic activity, and lowest cell voltage (2.703 V at 500 A.m(-2)) in electrowinning of zinc. It is the result of electro-catalytic synergistic effect between CeO2 and WC solid particles. Moreover, deposited zinc on the cathode is more compact and smooth by using PANI/CeO2/WC anode. It was also found that these characteristic peaks of polyaniline remain (1123 cm(-1) 1480 cm(-1), 1568 cm(-1)), which indicates polyaniline was not oxidized after electrolysis. These results demonstrated that the failure of polyaniline composite anode is ascribed to mechanical fatigue instead of polyaniline oxidation.									12	4	0	0	0	0	14			0304-386X	1879-1158		WOS:000428227300022

In HX-PES, Ce3d and O1s core levels show a parallel chemical shift as large as 3.2 eV, corresponding to the redox window where ionic conductivity is predominant. The window width is equal to the energy gap between donor and acceptor levels of the GDC electrolyte. The Ce M-edge SX-XAS spectra also show a considerable increase of Ce3+ satellite peak intensity, corresponding to electrochemical reduction by oxide ion migration. In addition to the reversible redox reaction, two distinct phenomena by the electrochemical transport of oxide ions are observed as an irreversible reduction of the entire oxide film by O-2 evolution from the GDC film to the gas phase, as well as a vigorous precipitation of oxygen gas at the bottom electrode to lift off the GDC film. These in situ spectroscopic observations describe well the electrochemical polarization behavior of a metal/GDC/metal capacitor-like two-electrode cell at room temperature.									18	1	0	0	1	0	18			1468-6996			WOS:000323882000012	27877594

Although excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of Mo2C has been achieved both in acid and basic media, the intrinsic hydrogen evolution ability of two-dimensional (2D) Mo2C is still not clear due to the difficulty of calculating the actual active surface area involved in the HER. In this work, the HER activity of Mo2C nanosheets is measured on single 2D Mo2C, which is synthesized through low-temperature carbonization of 2D molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) nanosheets on a SiO2/Si substrate. The edge sites of Mo2C exhibit high catalytic activity with a small Tafel slope of 40.2 mV dec(-1) and an overpotential of 152 mV for 10 mA cm(-2) in alkaline media. Theoretical analyses reveal that the energy barriers for cleaving the OH-H bond in H2O on the edge of Mo2C are much smaller than those on the basal plane of Mo2C and the Mo site of the edge of Mo2C displays the optimal Delta G(H) for the H absorption.									10	0	0	0	2	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000593047100046

Here, we report a nitrogen, sulfur co-doped carbon dots (NSCDs)/CoS hybrid with a three-dimensional mesoporous sponge-like nanostructure, fabricated via heat-treatment, which as electrocatalyst exhibits the desired electrocatalytic activity for electrochemical HER. A series of NSCDs/CoS hybrids with different contents of NSCDs were prepared by adjusting the concentration of NSCDs, of which the NSCDs/CoS hybrid with 20 mg L-1 NSCDs exhibits the best electrocatalytic activity towards HER with an onset potential of 0.095 V, an overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) of 165 mV, a small Tafel slope of 56 mV per decade, and a good stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. The excellent electrocatalytic activity of NSCDs/CoS for HER is attributed to synergetic effects of NSCDs and CoS, in which the NSCDs could protect the CoS from dissolution/agglomeration under acidic conditions, and the increased surface area of the NSCDs/CoS hybrid and the high charge transfer efficiency between NSCDs and CoS via Co-S-C bonding enhanced the HER performance.									93	4	0	0	6	0	93			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000395075600035

Here, taking the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as an example, we introduce a theoretical approach for designing robust metal cocatalysts supported on TiO2 using density functional theory calculations adopting on-site Coulomb correction and/or hybrid functionals. The approach starts with clarifying the individual function of each metal layer of metal/TiO2 composites in photocatalytic HER, covering both the electron transfer and surface catalysis aspects, followed by conducting a function-oriented optimization via exploring competent candidates. With this approach, we successfully determine and verify bimetallic Pt/Rh/TiO2 and Pt/Cu/TiO2 catalysts to be robust substitutes for conventional Pt/TiO2. The right metal type as well as the proper stacking sequence are demonstrated to be key to boosting performance. Moreover, we tentatively identify the tunneling barrier height as an effective descriptor for the important electron transfer process in photocatalysis on metal/oxide catalysts. We believe that this study pushes forward the frontier of photocatalyst design towards higher water splitting efficiency. Photocatalytic performances require both active catalytic surfaces and efficient electron transfer steps. Here the authors introduce a function-oriented catalyst design strategy optimizing both aspects and generalize an effective electron transfer descriptor on metal/oxide catalysts.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			2041-1723			WOS:000626604800027	33420037

This paper explores the regulation of Zn doping impacted the unique nanostructure and electrocatalytic performance on Co9S8. Herein, utilizing copper foam (CF) as substrate, a series of different nanostructure of (Zn-)Co9S8@CF has been synthesized by accurately varying the ratio of Zn2thorn to Co2+. Compared with aggregated pure Co9S8 and other different ratios contrast samples, ZneCo(9)S(8)@CF(1-1) with a zinc to cobalt ratio of 1 possesses highly dispersity which can be attributed to the novel nano-neuron network structure. The electrochemical measurements for HER demonstrate that Zn -Co9S8@CF-(1-1) not only reveals superior activity with small overpotentials to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in acidic (278 mV) and alkaline (273 mV) media, but also exhibits long-time durability in the solution with a wide range of pH. The excellent performance of Zn-Co9S8@CF-(1-1) can be attributed to the unique reticular structure which can facilitate exposure of numerous active sites and favorable long-term stability. The substrate of three-dimensional CF can provide the remarkable conductivity.

Light is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments and transferred to photochemical reaction centers to initiate electron and proton transfer reactions to store energy in a redox gradient and an electrochemical proton gradient (proton motive force, pmf), composed of a concentration gradient (Delta pH) and an electric field (Delta psi), which drives the synthesis of ATP through the thylakoid FoF1-ATP synthase. Although ATP synthase structure and function are conserved across biological kingdoms, the number of membrane-embedded ion-binding c subunits varies between organisms, ranging from 8 to 17, theoretically altering the H+/ATP ratio for different ATP synthase complexes, with profound implications for the bioenergetic processes of cellular metabolism. Of the known c-ring stoichiometries, photosynthetic c-rings are among the largest identified stoichiometries, and it has been proposed that decreasing the c-stoichiometry could increase the energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis. Indeed, there is strong evidence that the high H+/ATP of the chloroplast ATP synthase results in a low ATP/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) ratio produced by photosynthetic linear electron flow, requiring secondary processes such as cyclic electron flow to support downstream metabolism. We hypothesize that the larger c subunit stoichiometry observed in photosynthetic ATP synthases was selected for because it allows the thylakoid to maintain pmf in a range where ATP synthesis is supported, but avoids excess Delta psi and Delta pH, both of which can lead to production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent photodamage. Numerical kinetic simulations of the energetics of chloroplast photosynthetic reactions with altered c-ring size predicts the energy storage of pmf and its effects on the photochemical reaction centers strongly support this hypothesis, suggesting that, despite the low efficiency and suboptimal ATP/NADPH ratio, a high H+/ATP is favored to avoid photodamage. This has important implications for the evolution and regulation of photosynthesis as well as for synthetic biology efforts to alter photosynthetic efficiency by engineering the ATP synthase.									6	1	0	0	4	0	6			1664-462X			WOS:000514629000001	32082344

Although graphene quantum dot (GQD) has been explored as a potential photocatalyst, their performance remains inherently limited by poor visible light absorption and p-type conductivity. To address this problem, we have covalently functionalized GQD with visible light active photosensitizer Rhodamine 123. It was found that this dye-sensitized GQD could make quite stabilized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under visible light irradiation, which is in striking contrast to the virtually inactive photocatalytic HER performance of control GQD without dye. Efficient photo-induced electron transfer from Rhodamine 123 to GQD and also the transformation of p type GQD to the n-p ambipolar semiconductor, both boosted by covalent bonding, are responsible for such high photocatalytic HER performance. Observation of negative photocurrent at zero bias voltage during transient photocurrent measurement, also suggests its promising potential in the metal free photocathode system to achieve photo electrochemical H-2 production.

However, the effects of CuO with different plane exposures on the properties of the coupling system are not clear. In this research, Cu atom-terminated (001) plane-exposed CuO (CuO-10) is synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using NH3.H2O as the structure directing agent for the first time. CuO-10 has the excellent property of inducing PMS to degrade bisphenol A (BPA) in water, and its reaction rate constant (k) reaches 14 times higher than that of commercial CuO with exposed (010) plane terminated by O atoms (CuO-C). Meanwhile, CuO-10 exhibits a wide pH(initial) adaptability, and its BPA degradation exceeds 87% in the pH range of 3-9. Furthermore, compared with CuO-C/PMS, less radical and O-1(2) are found in CuO-10/PMS oxidation system. Compared to the UV/PMS system, organic contaminants in CuO/PMS systems are easier to oxidize via an oxygen-atom-transfer mechanism. Therefore, the equivalent to Cu (II)-OOSO3- metastable intermediate is speculated to play an important role in the CuO/PMS activation process, which oxidizes organic contaminants directly through oxygen-atom-transfer and single-electron-transfer path-ways. Furthermore, the CuO-10/PMS system is more likely to degrade organic pollutants through the oxygen -atom-transfer pathway than the CuO-C/PMS system. This study not only explores the influence of CuO crystal planes in efficiently inducing PMS activation but also provides new insights into the PMS activation process in the CuO/PMS oxidation system.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000808572300002

Fabrication of low-cost and high-efficiency electrocatalysts are still an urgent and challenging work. Porphyrins as visible-light photosensitizers have been extensively utilized in visible-light photocatalysts and photoelectronic materials. So, fabrication of novel porphyrin-based complexes will be benefited for high-efficiency hydrogen evolution and photoelectric response. Here a series of zirconium porphyrin-based coordination complexes were successfully fabricated via a facile two-step strategy. Due to the unique long chain-like structure and low charge-transfer resistance, the zirconium porphyrin-based coordination complexes displayed excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction. The ZrTPP-PTA-1 showed a low over potential of 60 mV at the current density 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 87 mV dec(-1) with an ultralow electron transfer resistance of 17.5 Omega. In addition, a quick photocurrent response occurred for these coordination complexes with a visible-light illumination. The photocurrent of the ZrTPP-OA-2 rised up to 2.5 mu A under visible-light irradiation. With this pleasant result, these zirconium porphyrin-based coordination complexes have a great potential to become available alternative of current noble electrocatalysts for photoelectric application.

However, the fabrication of such matrices (e.g., well-dispersed single-atom-doped M-N-4/NCs) often requires numerous steps and tedious processes. Herein, ultrasonic plasma engineering allows direct carbonization in a precursor solution containing metal phthalocyanine and aniline. When combining with the dispersion effect of ultrasonic waves, we successfully fabricated uniform single-atom M-N-4 (M = Fe, Co) carbon catalysts with a production rate as high as 10 mg min(-1). The Co-N-4/NC presented a bifunctional potential drop of Delta E = 0.79 V, outperforming the benchmark Pt/C-Ru/C catalyst (Delta E = 0.88 V) at the same catalyst loading. Theoretical calculations revealed that Co-N-4 was the major active site with superior O-2 adsorption-desorption mechanisms. In a practical Zn-air battery test, the air electrode coated with Co-N-4/NC exhibited a specific capacity (762.8 mAh g(-1)) and power density (101.62 mW cm(-2)), exceeding those of Pt/C-Ru/C (700.8 mAh g(-1) and 89.16 mW cm(-2), respectively) at the same catalyst loading. Moreover, for Co-N-4/NC, the potential difference increased from 1.16 to 1.47 V after 100 charge-discharge cycles. The proposed innovative and scalable strategy was concluded to be well suited for the fabrication of single-atom-doped carbons as promising bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction electrocatalysts for metal-air batteries.									31	7	0	0	0	0	31			2311-6706	2150-5551		WOS:000613005200002	34138279

The major objective of this study was to investigate the regulation of ROS involved in the photocatalytic degradation process via constructing a typical metal-semiconductor hybrid heterojunction using Ag nanoparticles/anatase TiO2 as an example. Based on radical capturing, electron paramagnetic resonance, and electron spin resonance experiments, an increase in the available ROS can be achieved in the Ag/TiO2 heterojunction due to the fast separation of photogenerated carriers. In addition, due to the change in the electron transfer pathway, superoxide radicals (O-center dot(2)-) are the dominant reactive species responsible for dye degradation using Ag/TiO2 rather than hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) as the main free radicals in pristine TiO2. This study offers fresh insight into the regulation of ROS in photodegradation via the construction of a Ag/TiO2 heterojunction.									4	0	0	0	1	0	4			1533-4880	1533-4899		WOS:000508548200018	31748041

The catalysts have been prepared with impregnation method and characterized by BET, XPS, TEM and STEM techniques. The role of humidity in the H-2/O-2 recombination reaction has been studied in a flow laboratory reactor using water saturated reaction mixture (0.5 vol% H-2). The time-on-stream behavior of catalyst in contact with reaction mixture of high H-2 concentration (7.2 vol%) has been studied using Microscal gas-flow through microcalorimeter. The thermal effects accompanying the H-2 conversion during slow deactivation of catalysts have been monitored. The pattern of changes in both the heat evolution and the H-2 conversion in the Pd-catalyzed H-2/O-2 recombination reaction seem to reflect the inhibiting effect of humidity present in the reaction mixture and water molecules formed in the reaction. The presence of both Li and Cs enhanced deactivation of Pd/Al2O3 catalyst and Cs-dopant displayed more pronounced effect. On the other hand, the alkali dopants do not essentially affect the amount of heat evolved during the recombination process ranging from 187 to 220 kJ/mol H-2, e.g. being lower than the heat of water formation (246 kJ/mol). The detrimental effect of Li,Cs dopant has been attributed to higher affinity to water, promoting retention of water molecules/films on the catalyst surface and blockage of active sites due to enhanced adsorption of surface species, like H2O/OH.

Besides the carboxylation reaction, RubisCO also catalyzes the oxygenation of RuBP by O-2, which is probably as old as its carboxylation properties. Based on molecular phylogeny, the occurrence of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-removing system and kinetic properties of different RubisCO forms, we postulated that RubisCO oxygenase activity appeared in local microoxic areas, yet before the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here, in reviewing the literature, we present a novel hypothesis: the RubisCO early oxygenase activity hypothesis. This hypothesis may be compared with the exaptation hypothesis, according to which latent RubisCO oxygenase properties emerged later during the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere. The reconstruction of ancestral RubisCO forms using ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) techniques, as a promising way for testing of RubisCO early oxygenase activity hypothesis, is presented.									12	0	0	0	11	0	12			0265-9247	1521-1878		WOS:000413666000002	28976010

These models include the latest available opacities and are computed through the subgiant branch. If Li-6 is not produced in appreciable amounts by stellar flares, then the detection of Li-6 in HD 84937 by Smith, Lambert, & Nissen is compatible with standard stellar evolution and standard big bang nucleosynthesis only if HD 84937 is a subgiant. The present parallax is inconsistent with HD 84937 being a subgiant star at the 2.5 sigma level. The most metal poor star with a measured Be-9 abundance is HD 140283, which is a relatively cool subgiant. Standard stellar evolution predicts that Be-9 will have been depleted in this star by approximately 0.3 dex (for T(eff) = 5640 K). Revising the abundance upward changes the oxygen-beryllium relation, suggesting incompatibility with standard cosmic-ray production models, and hence, standard big bang nucleosynthesis. However, an increase in the derived temperature of HD 140283 to 5740 K would result in little depletion of Be-9 and agreement with standard big bang nucleosynthesis.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0004-637X			WOS:A1994PD61200012

The annealing temperature was optimized in the range of 240 degrees C to 270 degrees C for 1.5h, and 1L thick nanosized pits were developed on the uniform film of the 2 L and 3 L MoS2 grown using the chemical vapor deposition method. We characterized the formation of the 1 L nanosized pits using nanoscale confocal photoluminescence (PL) and Raman spectroscopy. We observed that the PL intensity increased and the Raman frequency shifted, representative of the characteristics of 1 L MoS2 films. A subsequent hydrogen treatment process was useful for removing the oxygen-induced doping effect resulting from the annealing.

At present, observations of He-3 in the solar system and in the interstellar medium today suggest that the He-3 abundance has not increased significantly over the history of the Galaxy, while theoretical models of Galactic chemical evolution (utilizing current nucleosynthesis yields from stellar evolution and supernova models) predict a rather substantial increase in He-3. We consider the possibility that the solar( )3He abundance may have been affected by stellar processing in the solar neighborhood prior to the formation of the solar system. Such a discrepancy between solar abundances and average Galactic abundances by as much as a factor of 2 may be evidenced by several isotopic anomalies. Local destruction of He-3 by a similar amount could serve to help reconcile the expected increase in the He-3 abundance predicted by models of Galactic chemical evolution. We find, however, that the production of heavier elements, such as oxygen, places a strong constraint on the degree of He-3 destruction. We also explore the implications of both alternative models of Galactic chemical evolution and the stellar yields for He-3 in low-mass stars, which can explain the history of the He-3 concentration in the Galaxy.									35	0	0	0	1	0	35			0004-637X			WOS:A1996UH18700037

Herein, we successfully accelerate the water dissociation kinetics of NiMoO4 for prominent HER catalytic properties via simultaneous in situ interfacial engineering with molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) and doping with phosphorus (P). The as-synthesized P-doped NiMoO4/MoO2 heterostructure nanorods exhibit outstanding HER performance with an extraordinary low overpotential of -23 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), which is highly comparable to the performance of the state-of-art Pt/C coated on nickel foam (NF) catalyst. The density functional theory (DFT) analysis reveals the enhanced performance is attributed to the formation of MoO2 during the in situ epitaxial growth that substantially reduces the energy barrier of the Volmer pathway, and the introduction of P that provides efficient hydrogen desorption of NiMoO4.

The result shows that uneven laser typing edge affect the smoothness of gold plating, increasing the coating porosity and specific surface area, which provides high probability for water and Cl- attachment, even reach to kovar alloy layer through pore. What's more, the strong penetrating power of Cl- through the atoms gap contributes to react with metal layer and form chloride. The reaction products, such as NiCl2, FeCl2, FeCl3 become electrolyte layer of the electrochemical corrosion. Anode is iron and nickel corrosion, while cathode is oxygen corrosion. As the reaction, the chemical environment tends to Fe2+ and Fe3+ easy to combine with OH- to produce Fe(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3, and the further evolution products, oxide Fe2O3, characterized by a large number of spots in macroscopic.

Herein, with low-cost dicyandiamide and metal salts as precursor, FeCo alloy nanoparticles encapsulated in nitrogenated carbon nanotubes (FeCo-NCNTs) were facially synthesized as efficient HER electrocatalyst. Addition of iron as second element, though not facilitating the formation of carbon nanotube, was utilized to improve the physicochemical properties of metals. Via optimizing the atomic molar ratios of Fe/Co nanoparticles, the optimal Fe0.4Co0.6-NCNTs with thin carbon shell (c.a. 5-10 layer) and equally distribution of embedded alloy nanoparticles was found with outstanding HER activity. To achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), only overpotential of 50 mV, 157 mV and 202 mV were needed in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4), alkaline (1 M KOH), and neutral solutions. Its higher electrochemically active surface areas and lower electron transfer resistance may contribute to the excellent electrocatalytic HER. Furthermore, the illustrated current density slightly changed over 20 h, suggesting excellent stability. Hence, the present method provides cost-effective, high efficiency, and stable materials in developing the sustainable energy conversion systems. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Simultaneously, metal-organic frameworks with designable metal ion centers and organic ligands are the promising precursors for the one-step synthesis of metal encapsulated in carbon composites for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, we report the successful construction of Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4 encapsulated in carbon nanowires (Co-CoO/ZnFe2O4@CNWs) by annealing as-synthesized nanowire Co/Zn/Fe-MOF at 400 degrees C in N-2. This structure provides the rich defect sites and active centers, and the synergy of Co, CoO and ZnFe2O4 lead to efficient hydrogen evolution when the composite is used as a catalytic electrode for HER in 1.0 M KOH. The catalyst shows a low initial overpotential (97 mV) and a small Tafel slope (138 mV dec(-1)), and the overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) is only 226 mV. In addition, this composite material exhibits excellent long-term durability even after 1000 cycles. It is expected that it is a potential alternative catalyst for rational utilization in the field of electrolytic water decomposition. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The NOx reduction dynamics and selectivity towards N-2 or NH3 are modelled for three main reducing components present in the rich exhaust gas: CO, H-2, and unburned hydrocarbons (HCs). The following reactions are considered: CO, H-2 and HC oxidation, NOx reduction, NO/NO2 transformation, NO and NO2 storage, oxygen storage effects, water gas shift and steam reforming, and reduction of the stored NOx by H-2, CO and HC. Ammonia is formed mainly by the reaction of H-2 with NOx, but also by the water-assisted reaction of CO with NOx (formation and consequent hydrolysis of isocyanates). Inclusion of the latter route is necessary to explain the NH3 formation in CO-rich mixtures without H-2 at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures, water gas shift and steam reforming reactions enable in situ H-2 production from CO, HC and H2O. The formed ammonia subsequently reacts with oxygen and NOx deposited on the catalyst surface downstream, which results in NH3 wave travelling along the catalytic monolith.The highest NH3 yield is obtained around 200 degrees C, when the NH3 formation from the accumulated NOx is already ignited, while the ammonia consumption reactions are still relatively slow. At lower temperatures CO inhibits the NOx reduction by H-2 (i.e., the NH3 production). At higher temperatures the ammonia oxidation reactions become fast enough to eliminate most of the NH3 produced locally from the stored NOx. However, ammonia can be still observed after the completion of the regeneration, when it is formed steadily from the rich inlet gas containing NOx. Model results are confronted with the lab data, and calculated evolution of concentration profiles inside the monolith is discussed. The developed model is validated by engine test driving cycle data. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									54	3	0	0	4	0	56			0920-5861	1873-4308		WOS:000269990800043

Three characteristic, consecutive phases during methanol depletion have been identified, with oxygen evolution and carbon corrosion as dominating anode reactions. Irreversible aging of membrane electrode assemblies is caused by corrosion of Ru and the carbon support of the anode catalyst layers. The latter process leads to an irreversible performance loss up to 84%, an active surface loss up to 62% and a thinning of the anode catalyst layer. For a better understanding of the aging processes, an anode impedance analysis was carried out using a transmission line model based on primary & secondary pores. The fitting analysis revealed a strong increase of the resistances associated with processes in the anode catalyst layer, including methanol oxidation kinetics, proton conductivity and mass transport. Impedance data and pore size distributions show a particularly strong degradation of (small) primary pores in the last phase of methanol depletion, suggesting a degradation process starting in the larger pores and continuing in the smaller pores.

It remains unknown whether these functions can be independently optimised by evolution, or whether they interfere with each other. We report that Drosophila melanogaster populations adapted during 160 generations of experimental evolution to chronic larval malnutrition became more susceptible to intestinal infection with the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila. However, they do not show suppressed immune response or higher bacterial loads. Rather, their increased susceptibility to P.entomophila is largely mediated by an elevated predisposition to loss of intestinal barrier integrity upon infection. These results may reflect a trade-off between the efficiency of nutrient extraction from poor food and the protective function of the gut, in particular its tolerance to pathogen-induced damage.									20	0	0	0	17	0	20			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000361009000011	26249109

Recently, several nano-structured gold (Au) catalysts have shown impressive catalytic activities toward NRR However, the atomic origin of high catalytic activities of Au catalysts is vague. In this work, a quantitative relationship between the generalized coordination number (GCN) and NRR activity is established. In particular, the NRR activity is linearly increased with the decrease of GCN values of Au surface atoms. As a proof-of-concept experiment, the NRR activity of nanoporous gold (NPG) with a high proportion of low-coordinated surface atoms is investigated and compared with that of Au octahedra (OCTA) enclosed with (111) facets. As expected, NPG exhibits a high NH3 production rate of 30.5 mu g h(-1) mg(-1), which is 5.8 times larger than that of Au OCTA. In addition, the excellent catalytic performance of NPG can be retained for 21 h by showing constant current density, NH3 production rate, and faradaic efficiency. The findings in this work would provide guiding principles for designing efficient NRR catalysts.									29	2	0	0	1	0	29			2168-0485			WOS:000472240900006

However, the lack of high-performance cost-effective electrocatalyst severely hinders its applications. Here, a multinary high-entropy intermetallic (HEI) that possesses an unusual periodically ordered structure containing multiple non-noble elements is reported, which can serve as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution. This HEI exhibits excellent activities in alkalinity with an overpotential of 88.2 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV dec(-1), which are comparable to those of noble catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the chemical complexity and surprising atomic configurations provide a strong synergistic function to alter the electronic structure. Furthermore, the unique L1(2)-type ordered structure enables a specific site-isolation effect to further stabilize the H2O/H* adsorption/desorption, which dramatically optimizes the energy barrier of hydrogen evolution. Such an HEI strategy uncovers a new paradigm to develop novel electrocatalyst with superior reaction activities.									103	6	0	0	5	0	104			0935-9648	1521-4095		WOS:000537148400002	32267030

The curing process has been catalyzed by basic and acid catalysts. The use of a thermally activated base generator (1-methylimidazolium tetraphenylborate, BG1MI), which is an organocatalyst, allowed a better control on the curing initiation than those traditionally used dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) or tertiary amines. The curing evolution was investigated by DSC and FTIR spectroscopy.The materials obtained were characterized by thermomechanical and mechanical tests. Homogeneous materials were obtained in all cases. The chemical structure of the network was correlated with the thermal and mechanical data determined. T-g values in the range of 75 to 150 degrees C were obtained. The thermal degradation of these materials has also been investigated and a complex degradation mechanism, with three different steps was observed in all cases. These materials showed a higher thermal stability than their oxygen counterparts did.The thermosets obtained using the latent organocatalyst have similar characteristics to the ones obtained by using the common DBTDL.									13	0	0	0	1	0	13			1381-5148	1873-166X		WOS:000456903200020

Pyrolysis of dimethyl ether was studied in a variable-pressure now reactor at 2.5 atm and 1118 K. Studies were also conducted in an atmospheric pressure flow reactor at about 1085 K. These experiments included trace-oxygen-assisted pyrolysis, as well as full oxidation experiments, with the equivalence ratio (phi) varying From 0.32 less than or equal to phi less than or equal to 3.4. On-line, continuous, extractive sampling in conjunction with Fourier Transform infra-Red, Non-Dispersive Infra-Red (for CO and CO2) and electrochemical (for O-2) analyses were performed to quantify species at specific locations along the axis of the turbulent flow reactors. Species concentrations were correlated against residence time in the reactor and species evolution profiles were compared to the predictions of a previously published detailed kinetic mechanism. Some changes were made to the model in order to improve agreement with the present experimental data. However, the revised model continues to reproduce previously reported high-temperature jet-stirred reactor and shock tube results.

Here, we propose a strategy to enhance charge transport in discharge products by surface engineering of cathode catalysts with donor and acceptor sites to improve solid-solid interfacial electron transfer properties between catalysts and discharge products. Free-standing layered double oxides loaded with pyrolyzed sodium poly(aminobenzenesulfonate)-derived sulfur-doped carbon nanosheets and carbon nanosheets with sulfoxide groups are synthesized and utilized to investigate donor and acceptor sites effect on the performance of lithium-oxygen batteries. The free-standing cathode with hybrid donor and acceptor sites is capable of operation in oxygen with distinct (dis)charge plateau and superior cycling stability (over 60 cycles at a fixed capacity of 0.53 mAh cm(-2)). The superior properties are attributed to the enhanced charge transport in lithium peroxide by the formation of hole polarons/Li+ vacancies on acceptor sites and electron polarons/disordered lithium peroxide phase on donor sites. This work provides a promising route to enhance defective charge transport in discharge products by optimization of donor and acceptor sites on cathode catalysts for high-performance lithium-oxygen batteries.									19	3	0	0	1	0	19			2405-8297			WOS:000508681700004

However, the battery chemistry still faces several challenges limiting the performance of some key performance indicators and preventing its commercial deployment. Among these, cycle stability and lifespan are important, especially for stationary energy applications, and require improvement. In this work, a spontaneous reaction between Zn metal and electrolytes evolving hydrogen and Zn ions is shown to drive the electrolyte pH towards alkaline conditions, which in turn hinders the reversible electrochemical reactions at both positive and negative electrodes. Proton release during the oxidation of a Mn2+ additive and promotion of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the positive electrode by implementing a float-charging protocol (constant voltage at the end of the charging process) is proposed as a simple strategy to restore the initial pH. Using a pH indicator dissolved in the electrolyte and assembling the electrochemical cell in a spectrophotometer cuvette, the effect of floating voltage is evaluated in operando, allowing optimization of the floating voltage to enable the electrolyte pH to remain stable.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1388-2481	1873-1902		WOS:000793408300001

Controllable growing of TMCs becomes increasingly important, especially for the layer number, doping, and morphology. Here, we successfully tune the morphology of MoS2, MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2, from homogenous films to individual single crystalline grains only via changing the oxidizing growth conditions. The oxidization degrees are determined by the oxygen that adsorbed on substrates and the oxygen concentrations in reaction gas together. We find the homogenous films are easily formed under the reductive conditions, triangular grains prefer the weak oxidizing conditions, and medium oxidizing conditions bring in dendritic grains with higher oxygen doping and inhomogenous photoluminescence intensities from edge to interior regions shown in the dendritic grains. These growth rules under different oxidizing conditions are easily generalized to other TMCs, which also show potential for growing specific TMCs with designed oxygen doping levels.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000765970000001	35158340

Herein, we report for the first time the creation of new metal-free porous carbon framework catalysts derived from N-rich hypercrosslinked polymers (HCPs) using pyrrole as building blocks for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) (denoted as PCF-HCPs). The PCF-HCPs obtained at the pyrolysis temperature of 900 degrees C (PCF-HCP-900), displayed outstanding catalytic activity towards the ORR compared with other PCF-HCPs pyrolysis temperature. Due to PCF-HCP-900 with large specific surface, excellent porosity and, importantly, exposed active sites caused by N doping with high density, the catalysts exhibited outstanding ORR activity in alkaline medium, i.e., the PCF-HCP-900 yielded a half-wave potential of 0.84 V, which was 10 mV higher than that of the state of-the-art Pt/C catalyst (0.83 V), and onset potential of 0.95 V (vs. RHE), a high diffusion limiting current density of 4.8 mA cm(-2), better methanol tolerance and long-term stability (2 mV negative shift after 3000 potential cycles) than commercial Pt/C. Furthermore, PCF-HCP-900 shows a favorable 4-electron transfer process (n approximate to 3.96) and lower H2O2 yield. Based on these merits, the PCF-HCP-900 may open a new possibility for design of ORR metal-free catalyst of fuel-cell technologies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, nonedible sugars and polyols are promising starting materials to produce olefins by dehydration, deoxygenation, or deoxydehydration (DODH) of these poly vicinal alcohols. In this perspective, we highlight the recent evolution of rhenium-catalyzed dehydration and DODH of biomass-derived alcohols and polyols to obtain olefins. Improving over the dassical acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, rhenium-mediated systems are very selective and more active to provide high yields of olefin products, but dehydration alone cannot be used to fully defiinctionalize sugars. This issue is addressed by a growing research effort in the field of Re-catalyzed DODH, which allows complete dehydroxylation to form olefins in high yield. Recent developments in this field include the development of new molecular rhenium catalysts, the application of cheaper and more available reductants, and a growing mechanistic understanding owing to both experimental and computational studies. Finally, recent efforts to move beyond rhenium toward cheaper metals (Mo, V) are discussed.									114	1	0	0	8	0	115			2155-5435			WOS:000347513400035

The main objective of Li-air battery is to provide long-range electric-vehicles, while functioning as an environmentally friendly and compact energy storage solution. They offer the highest theoretical energy density (3500 Wh/kg), almost 20% higher than the ordinary Li-ion batteries. Nonetheless, Li-air batteries still face numerous issues, the most serious of which are high overpotential and parasitic reactions. Several redox mediators (RM) have been studied in order to reduce the high overpotential and the influence of side reactions. RM function in the electrolyte as soluble catalysts, limiting the formation of singlet oxygen while promoting the formation of discharge product Li2O2. This research primarily focuses on the optimization of Li-air cells with different redox mediators in conjunction with appropriate electrolyte, as a result reducing overpotential, parasitic byproducts and increasing efficiency. Under standard electrolytic conditions, ruthenocene exhibits high stability by completing 83 cycles, thus outperforming the other mediators being investigated. Further, di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone is more commonly used for discharge reaction and has been shown to increase the capacity of Li-O-2 batteries by 80 times. This study reconfirms lithium bis(tri-fluoromethylsulfonyl) imide in tetraethyleneglycol dimethylether as the most stable electrolyte.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000833530500006

This review article presents a panorama of the latest advancements in the rational design and development of g-C3N4 and g-C3N4-based composite photocatalysts for HER application. Concretely, the review starts with the development history, synthetic strategy, electronic structure and physicochemical characteristics of g-C3N4 materials, followed by the rational design and engineering of various nanostructured g-C3N4 (e.g. thinner, highly crystalline, doped, and porous g-C3N4) photocatalysts for HER application. Then a series of highly efficient g-C3N4 (e.g., metal/g-C3N4, semiconductor/g-C3N4, metal organic framework/g-C3N4, carbon/g-C3N4, conducting polymer/g-C3N4, sensitizer/g-C3N4) composite photocatalysts are exemplified. Lastly, this review provides a comprehensive summary and outlook on the major challenges, opportunities, and inspiring perspectives for future research in this hot area on the basis of pioneering works. It is believed that the emerging g-C3N4-based photocatalysts will act as the ldquoholy grailrdquofor highly efficient photocatalytic HER under visible-light irradiation.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-5692			INSPEC:19937113

Enhancing the electrocatalytic activity by reducing the amount of Pt is highly challenging. In this work, a systematic physicochemical and electrochemical study on platinum nano-islands (Pt NIs) architectured on three-dimensional nanocarbon hybrid (3D-NCHy) was carried out. A detailed comparison of the catalyst activity with respect to Pt decorated on other carbon nanostructures has been evaluated. Pt NIs@3D-NCHy demonstrated substantially high degree of stability and durability during the electrochemical evaluations. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) studies were carried out using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), Tafel polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Pt NIs@3D-NCHy catalyst exhibited lowest overpotential value of -13mV for attaining a current density of -10mAcm(-2). The stability and durability of the catalyst was tested by continuous accelerated degradation test (ADT) for 10,000cycles, and a high degree of stability was observed for the material. The turnover frequency (TOF) was estimated to be 6.3s(-1) at an overpotential (?)=-70mV. Interesting, the as-synthesized hybrid with a Pt loading of 3.8 mu gcm(-2), established performance equivalence to that of 20wt.% Pt/C which has Pt loading of 20 mu gcm(-2).									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			0947-7047	1862-0760		WOS:000476796200027

We created a dissociative wavepacket of O-2(+) by photoionization of O-2 with the irradiation of an intense attosecond pulse train (APT) in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) wavelength region, and probed it with another XUV APT by scanning delay between the two APTs. We revealed the evolution of the electron-nuclear wavepacket by the analysis of the spectral phase in the Fourier transform of the recorded delay dependent momentum spectrum of O+. We also found the correlation between the photon energy and the released kinetic energy originating from the dissociation of Rydberg states of O-2 followed by the autoionization of the fragment O atom in the Rydberg states.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0953-4075	1361-6455		WOS:000548372200001

Herein, we reported that interface electronically coupled Sb/Nb2CTx could be a highly efficient NRR catalyst which delivered an NH3 yield of 49.8 mu g h(-1) mg(-1) with faradaic efficiencies as high as 27.3%, representing the highest NRR selectivity achieved in MXene-based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the coupling of Sb and Nb2CTx could generate an electron-rich interface enabling the downshift of the p-band center of interfacial Sb atoms, which served as main active sites to promote the N-2 activation and hydrogenation while restricting the competing hydrogen evolution.									45	2	0	0	2	0	45			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000673987100001

Herein, we demonstrate a simple approach to generate atomically dispersed platinum via a thermal emitting method using bulk Pt metal as a precursor, significantly simplifying synthesis routes and minimizing synthesis costs. The ammonia produced by pyrolysis of Dicyandiamide can coordinate with platinum atoms by strong coordination effect. Then, the volatile Pt(NH3)(x) can be anchored onto the surface of defective graphene. The as-prepared Pt SAs/DG exhibits high activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction and selective oxidation of various organosilanes. This viable thermal emitting strategy can also be applied to other single metal atoms, for example, gold and palladium. Our findings provide an enabling and versatile platform for facile accessing SACs toward many industrial important reactions.									182	20	0	0	16	0	185			0002-7863	1520-5126		WOS:000462260400002	30832476

Carbon-based microelectrades were modified with a [NiFe]-hydrogenase embedded in a viologen-modified redox hydrogel for the fabrication of a sensitive hydrogen biosensor By integrating the microbiosensor in a scanning photoelectrochemical microscope, it was capable of serving simultaneously as local light source to initiate photo(bio) electrochemical reactions while acting as sensitive biosensor for the detection of hydrogen. A hydrogen evolution biocatalyst based on photosystem 1-platinum nanoparticle biocomplexes embedded into a specifically designed redox polymer was used as a model for proving the capability of the developed hydrogen biosensor for the detection of hydrogen upon localized illumination. The versatility and sensitivity of the proposed microbiosensor as probe tip allows simplification of the set-up used for the evaluation of complex electrochemical processes and the rapid investigation of local photoelectrocatalytic activity of biocatalysts towards light-induced hydrogen evolution.									22	0	0	0	3	0	22			0956-5663	1873-4235		WOS:000401201300058	28334627

In this work, for the first time, we explored the use of high entropy oxide (HEO) comprising five metal ingredients (Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, and Fe), to accelerate the reduction reaction of DO into reactive oxygen species (ROS) for boosting the ECL performance of the luminol-DO system. Benefiting from the existing abundant oxygen vacancies induced by the unique crystal structure of the HEO, DO could be efficiently converted into ROS, thus significantly boosting the performance of the corresponding ECL sensor (with an similar to 240-fold signal enhancement in this study). As a proof of concept, under optimal conditions, the developed HEO-involved luminol-DO ECL sensing system was successfully applied for efficient biosensing of dopamine and alkaline phosphatase with a fine linear range from 1 pM to 10 nM and from 0.01 to 100 U/L as well as a low limit of detection of 5.2 pM and 0.008 U/L, respectively.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000757864100001	35099931

We present an integrated modelling approach and the computer program PTLOOP that combine thermodynamic and oxygen isotope fractionation modelling for multirock open systems. The strategy involves a robust petrological model performing on-the-fly Gibbs energy minimizations coupled to an oxygen fractionation model for a given chemical and isotopic bulk rock composition; both models are based on internally consistent databases. This approach is applied to subduction zone metamorphism to predict the possible range of delta O-18 values for stable phases and aqueous fluids at various pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions in the subducting slab. The modelled system is composed of a mafic oceanic crust with a sedimentary cover of known initial chemical composition and bulk delta O-18. The evolution of mineral assemblages and delta O-18 values of each phase is calculated along a defined P-T path for two typical compositions of basalts and sediments. In a closed system, the dehydration reactions, fluid loss and mineral fractionation produce minor to negligible variations (i.e. within 1 parts per thousand) in the bulk delta O-18 values of the rocks, which are likely to remain representative of the protolith composition. In an open system, fluid-rock interaction may occur (1) in the metasediment, as a consequence of infiltration of the fluid liberated by dehydration reactions occurring in the metamorphosed mafic oceanic crust, and (2) in the metabasalt, as a consequence of infiltration of an external fluid originated by dehydration of underlying serpentinites. In each rock type, the interaction with external fluids may lead to shifts in delta O-18 up to 1 order of magnitude larger than those calculated for closed systems. Such variations can be detected by analysing in situ oxygen isotopes in key metamorphic minerals such as garnet, white mica and quartz. The simulations show that when the water released by the slab infiltrates the forearc mantle wedge, it can cause extensive serpentinization within fractions of 1 Myr and significant oxygen isotope variation at the interface. The approach presented here opens new perspectives for tracking fluid pathways in subduction zones, to distinguish porous from channelled fluid flows, and to determine the P - T conditions and the extent of fluid-rock interaction.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			1869-9510	1869-9529		WOS:000519722900001

However, the active sites of pristine PtSe2 are only located at the edges while the sites in basal plane are largely inactive. To change such situation, in this study we introduce Pd dopant and vacancies to activate the basal plane for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Based on systematic density functional theory calculations, we find that Pd doping reduces the band gap and enhances the catalytic ability, and the divacancy sites (V-Se2 and V-Pt2) in pristine PtSe2 monolayer and the monovacancy sites (V-Se, V-Pd) as well as the divacancy sites (V-Pt2, V-PdPt) in PdPtSe4 monolayer significantly improve the catalytic activities comparable to that of Pt(1 1 1). A band-center model is applied to better understand the difference in HER activities, where the chemical bond energies of H (Delta G(1)) show an approximately linear relationship with the energy of d/p level of Pt/Se. The strategy proposed here would be applicable to other two-dimensional materials.									12	0	0	0	0	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000618307800006

Modulating the reaction mechanism of Li2O2 is of crucial importance for a high-performance Li-O-2 battery. Herein, we report a composite of amorphous RuO2 nanoparticles decorated carbon nanotubes (A-RuO2@CNT) as an efficient catalyst for Li-O-2 batteries. The amorphous catalyst contains abundant defects and vacancies as well as distorted atom arrangements, which provide sufficient active sites for reactions and enhance the affinity for LiO2 intermediates. As a result, the formation/decomposition mechanisms of Li2O2 are reasonably regulated. An amorphous film-like Li2O2 product forms and uniformly deposits on the surface of A-RuO2@CNT, thus achieving faster redox kinetics and smaller overpotential. When used in Li-O-2 batteries, the amorphous catalyst affords remarkably decreased charge overpotential and enhanced cyclic stability, which is superior to its crystalline counterpart.									21	1	0	0	2	0	20			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000623327200004

Doping the NiOxHy structure with other metals could lead to enhanced catalytic properties but more research needs to be done to understand the role of the doping metal on the EOR. We prepared NiOxHy films doped with Fe or Co with different metallic ratios by electrodeposition and evaluated the EOR. We found a positive and negative effect on the catalytic activity after the incorporation of Co and Fe, respectively. Our results suggest that Ni atoms are the active sites for the EOR since Tafel slopes were similar on the binary and pristine nickel (oxy)hydroxides and that the formal potential of the Ni(II)/Ni(III) redox couple is a good descriptor for the EOR activity. This work also highlights the importance of controlled metal doping on catalysts and may help in the design and development of improved materials for the EOR.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			1868-2529	1868-5994		WOS:000486206000004

This coarse-grained simulation method, which is based on a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme, is verified with experimental data on the depth-resolved changes in optical properties and chemical composition that have been previously determined. By modelling the depth-dependency of physical processes that occur in the coating, such as the absorption of photons and the diffusion of oxygen, the experimentally observed evolution of depth gradients in chemical composition can be well described by the simulation. A sensitivity analysis of individual simulation input parameters with respect to a set of resulting observables is performed and the results provide insight into the influence of specific reaction mechanisms on the overall degradation process and help to distinguish essential from less important processes. The values of input parameters that result in the most accurate simulation of the experimental data are determined with an optimisation procedure. In this way, the numerical values of several kinetic and physical parameters that are difficult to determine directly in an experimental way, such as various reaction rate constants, can be obtained from the simulations.									9	1	0	0	0	0	10			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000358347500032	26166445

It is shown that the SILD nanotechnology, which is based on successive treatment of appropriate substrates in solutions of a platinum complex compound and a reducing agent, is effective for controlled Pt0 nanoparticles formation on the substrate surface. The Pt nanoparticles synthesized using Na2PtCl6 and NaBH4 precursors are characterized. It is found that the concentration and size of the Pt0 nanoparticles deposited on the titanium foil surface can be controlled by the number of deposition cycles. It is established that the size of the Pt nanoparticles depends on the synthesis conditions and varies from 3.3 nm to 10.0 nm for samples synthesized as a result of 10-40 SILD cycles. A model explaining Pt nanoparticle growth during SILD is suggested. It is shown that the nanoparticles obtained exhibit electrocatalytic properties in the hydrogen evolution reaction during acidic water electrolysis.

J	Jiang, Yongzhen; Zou, Wenxu; Li, Yadong; Cai, Yingxiang								Theoretical insights into TM@PHEs as single-atom catalysts for water splitting based on density functional theory								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				24	2			975	981		10.1039/d1cp03340a		DEC 2021		JAN 4 2022	2022	Single-atom catalysis is the new frontier of heterogeneous catalysis and has attracted considerable attention as it exhibits great potential in hydrogen evolution to mitigate energy crisis and environmental issues. The support materials for single-atom catalysts (SACs) play a significant role in stabilizing the metal atoms, preventing their aggregation, and enhancing the catalytic activity. Two-dimensional sp(2) hybridized PHE-graphene might be a real support for SACs due to the potential energy well induced by its enneagon, hexagon and pentagon carbon rings. In this study, eleven transition metal (TM) atoms adsorbed on PHE-graphene (TM@PHEs) are taken into account based on density functional theory (DFT) and PHE-graphene is proved to be an ideal single-atom carrier for water splitting. In particular, the TM@PHEs (TM = Fe, Ni, Ru, and Pd) exhibit high catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The reaction path of water splitting is also determined. Due to their much lower energy barrier, both Fe@PHE and Ru@PHE are more promising SACs. In addition, the charge density difference, Bader charge analysis and spin projected density of states (PDOS) are investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000730797200001	34915549

Here our first-principles study depicts the 2D PdPS as a promising material for the photovoltaic solar cell and highly active catalyst for HER. Specifically, the calculated optical gap of PdPS monolayer is 1.65 eV, close to the ideal gap for solar cells. The PdPS monolayer shows a remarkably high absorbance in the visible light region and the exciton binding energy is estimated to be 0.55 eV. The PdPS sheet is found to possess highly active sites for HER, with the ideal value of Gibbs free energy, which is more desirable than that of Pt and MoS2. Furthermore, we find the single-layer PdPS can be obtained experimentally by mechanical cleavage and it is dynamically stable by analysing its vibrational normal modes. Our work expands the family of 2D solar cells and the highly active HER activity of PdPS layer will place it as a promising catalyst for water splitting. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The ORR has been associated with expensive noble metal catalysts that facilitate the O-2 adsorption, dissociation, and subsequent electron transfer. Single- or few-atom motifs based on earth-abundant transition metals, such as Fe, Co, and Mo, combined with nonmetallic elements, such as P, S, and N, embedded in a carbon-based matrix represent one of the most promising alternatives. Often these are referred to as single atom catalysts; however, the coordination number of the metal atom as well as the type and nearest neighbor configuration has a strong influence on the function of the active sites, and a more adequate term to describe them is metal-coordinated motifs. Despite intense research, their function and catalytic mechanism still puzzle researchers. They are not molecular systems with discrete energy states; neither can they fully be described by theories that are adapted for heterogeneous bulk catalysts. Here, recent results on single- and few-atom electrocatalyst motifs are reviewed with an emphasis on reports discussing the function and the mechanism of the active sites.									69	12	0	0	2	0	70			1614-6832	1614-6840		WOS:000486795700001

We have studied structural relevance of Ca2+ to the oxygen-evolving center (OEC) of Photosystem II (PS II) by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The single-pulse induced FTIR difference spectra of PS II membranes reflecting solely the structural changes of OEC between in the S-1 and S-2 states were measured by controlling the redox potential and pH of the buffer. Comparison between the two S-2/S-1 difference spectra using untreated and Ca2+-depleted PS II membranes showed that the negative bands at 1560 and 1403 cm(-1) (belonging to S-1) and the positive bands at 1587 and 1364 cm(-1) (belonging to S-2) were lost upon Ca2+ depletion. These bands were assigned to the asymmetric (higher frequency bands) and symmetric (lower frequency bands) COO- stretching modes of a certain carboxylate group in Asp, Glu or the C-termini, based on the infrared data of 20 amino acids and the S-2/S-1 spectra of N-15-labeled PS II membranes. The frequency differences of the asymmetric and symmetric COO- bands, i.e., 157 cm(-1) for S-1 and 223 cm(-1) for S-2, indicated that this carboxylate group possesses the structure of bridging bidentate coordination in the S-1 state and that of unidentate coordination in the S-2 state. Taking together the observation of disappearance of these bands upon Ca2+ depletion, it was concluded that (i) this carboxylate serves as a bridging ligand between the redox-active Mn and the Ca2+ ions, (ii) upon S-2 formation, the coordination bond of this carboxylate to Ca2+ is selectively broken, and (iii) upon depletion of Ca2+, this carboxylate ligand is liberated even from the Mn ion. Along with the changes of COO- bands, several intense bands in 1680-1630 cm(-1), which were assigned to the amide I modes of backbone amide groups, were lost upon Ca2+ depletion. This indicates that some perturbations on the protein conformations around the Mn-cluster induced by the S-2 formation require the presence of Ca2+ in OEC. Possible roles of Ca2+ in the oxygen-evolving reactions are discussed based on these findings.									165	3	0	0	120	0	167			0005-2728			WOS:A1995QM74400006

However, the provision of high intrinsic activity, active-site accessibility, and structural stability of MOF-derived Co-embedded N-doped carbon (Co/N-C) for HER and IRR is challenging. In this work, core-shell MOF-in-MOF precursors are designed to construct novel double-shell N-C-in-Co/N-C electrocatalysts with nanorod-and rhombic dodecahedron-shaped hollow morphologies (NR-H-C and RD-H-C). The double-shell structured NR-H-C and RD-H-C significantly enhance the HER and IRR activity of Co-MOF-derived Co/N-C. Specifically, NR-H-C achieves a high N-content (10.35 at.%), large specific surface area (590.87 m(2) g(-1)), and hierarchical porous configuration (micropores and mesopores). When NR-H-C is applied as the HER catalyst in alkaline electrolyte, it exhibits an admired overpotential of 123 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). The solar cell adopting NR-H-C as counter electrode for IRR achieves a high short circuit current density of 16.77 mA cm(-2), an open-circuit voltage of 0.745 V, a fill factor of 0.682, and a power conversion efficiency of 8.51%, higher than that of Pt-based solar cell (16.26 mA cm(-2), 0.744 V, 0.602, and 7.28%). The elucidatory Volmer-Heyrovsky HER mechanism and reversed Volmer-Heyrovsky IRR mechanism give a better understanding of the enhanced dual-functional activity of NR-H-C. This work provides an essential information for the rational design of high-performance dual-functional HER and IRR catalysts and further open up a new avenue for the construction of multicomponent MOFs in the energy conversion field.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000830245500002

While the bacterial biosynthetic pathway is similar to that of plants, the individual enzymes are very distantly related and arose via convergent evolution. The cytochromes P450 (CYPs) that catalyze the multi-step oxidation of the alkane precursor ent-kaurene (1) to ent-kauren-19-oic acid (5), are called ent-kaurene oxidases (KOs), and in plants are from the CYP701 family, and share less than 19% amino acid sequence identity with those from bacteria, which are from the phylogenetically distinct CYP117 family. Here the reaction series catalyzed by CYP117 was examined by O-18(2) labeling experiments, the results indicate successive hydroxylation of 1 to ent-kauren-19-ol (2) and then ent-kauren-19,19-diol (3) and most likely an intervening dehydration to ent-kauren-19-al (4) prior to the concluding hydroxylation to 5. Accordingly, the bacterial and plant KOs converged on catalysis of the same series of reactions, despite their independent evolutionary origin.									6	0	0	0	5	0	6			1477-0520	1477-0539		WOS:000411463200012	28858359

Here, Cu clusters were anchored on defective diamond graphene (Cu-n/ND@GR, n = 3, 4) to form a new class of two-dimensional nano-catalysts. Based on density functional theory, the catalytic performance and selective mechanisms of these configurations were studied systematically. By anchoring the appropriate number and configuration of Cu clusters on the defective graphene, specific reduction products (e.g., CO, CH4, and CH3OH) could be obtained. In particular, the inverted triangle configuration of Cu-3/ND@GR electroreduces CO2 to methane with an overpotential of only -0.53 eV. In addition, bonding analysis confirmed the stability of the Cu-n/ND@GR. The product selectivity was analyzed by calculating the deformation charge density, further revealing the CO2RR mechanism. Furthermore, side reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and competitive production of formic acid) do not hinder the CO2RR catalytic activity. This research expands the family of catalysts for the CO2RR and the application scenarios of transition metals loaded on graphene, which provides new insights into the design and preparation of composite nano-catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000829548000001

For temperatures above 20 million kelvin, the CNO cycle dominates energy production, and its rate is determined by the slowest process, the N-14(p, gamma)O-15 radiative capture reaction. This reaction proceeds through direct and resonant capture into the ground state and several excited states in O-15. High energy data for capture into each of these states can be extrapolated to stellar energies using an R-matrix fit. The results from several recent extrapolation studies are discussed. A new experiment at the L UNA (Laboratory for Underground Nuclear Astrophysics) 400 kV accelerator in Italy's Gran Sasso laboratory measures the total cross section of the N-14(p, gamma)O-15 reaction with a windowless gas target and a 4 pi BGO summing detector, down to center of mass energies as low as 70 keV. After reviewing time characteristics of the LUNA facility, the main features of this experiment are discussed, as well as astrophysical scenarios where cross section data in the energy range covered have a direct impact, without any extrapolation.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1434-6001	1434-601X		WOS:000208079500025		
J	Pandey, Aparna; Kumar, Shravan; Singh, Garima; Prasad, Sheo Mohan								Regulatory role of gamma-aminobutyric acid in cyanobacteria challenged with UV-B: The implication of nitric oxide								PLANT STRESS				5						100094	10.1016/j.stress.2022.100094				AUG 2022	2022	The present study examined the alleviatory role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in UV-B challenged nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria and the significant role of nitric oxide (NO) as a downstream signal in GABA-mediated responses. UV-B (0.48 W m(-2)) stress reduced the growth by 37% and 33% in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 and Nostoc muscorum ATCC 27893, respectively. The diminished growth under UV-B stress was due to the damaging effects on photosynthetic pigment contents [chlorophyll a (Chl a), carotenoids, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, and phycoerythrin], photosynthetic oxygen evolution, and photosystem (PS) II photochemistry, with a decline in Chl a fluorescence parameters [maximum photosynthetic quantum yield (Fv/Fm or Phi_Po), quantum yield of electron transport flux (Phi_Eo), yield of electron transport per trapped exciton (Psi_o), size and number of active photosynthetic reaction centers (Fv/Fo) and performance index (PIABS)]. However, a rise in energy flux parameters [absorption flux per reaction center (ABS/RC), trapping flux per reaction center (TRo/RC), dissipation flux per reaction center (DIo/RC), and electron transport flux per reaction center (ETo/RC)] was observed in both cyanobacteria. Additionally, UV-B stress induced a significant rise in levels of oxidative markers [superoxide radicals (O-2(center dot-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents], and respiratory uptake of oxygen in the tested cyanobacteria. Contrarily, exogenous supplementation of GABA (50 nM) and NO [as sodium nitroprusside (SNP); 10 mu M] resulted in a significant recovery of growth and photosystem (PS) II activity and reduction in oxidative damage. Furthermore, application of NO scavenger [2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO; 20 mu M)] and NO synthase inhibitor [NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 mu M)] significantly diminished the exogenously supplemented GABA-mediated responses under UV-B stress exposure. These results suggest that NO is the final requirement for the GABA-mediated tolerance against UV-B stress in the tested cyanobacteria.									1	0	0	0	1	0	1			2667-064X			WOS:000813941800002

Here hetero-structure of coupled Ir with Co nanocrystals on graphite is designed as pH-universal catalyst for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Graphite acts as effective matrix for the well dispersion of Ir and Co nanocrystals, benefiting the high exposure of active sites. Coupling Ir with Co generates large amounts of lattice distortion among the hetero-interface as active sites for improved catalysis. Importantly, the synergistic effect between hetero nanocrystals can greatly optimize the HER mechanism by accelerating the water dissociation and hydrogen desorption steps. The developed catalyst exhibits remarkably efficient and pH-universal catalysis activity toward HER, which generates a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with low over-potentials of 44 mV in acidic media, 49 mV in alkaline media, and 64 mV in neutral media. In addition, the developed dinuclear catalyst shows remarkably higher mass activities than Ir/C and even Pt/C in all pH conditions, indicating great potential for practical water splitting application.									5	0	0	0	1	0	5			2468-0230			WOS:000663427200005

We herein demonstrate a facile method to improve the hydrogen evolution performance of Pt-based electrocatalysts by simply decorating the-state-of-the-art and commercially available Pt/C with hydrophobic protic ([DBU][NTf2]) or aprotic ([BMIm][NTf2]) ionic liquid. The current densities of [BMIm] @Pt/C and [DBU-FI]@Pt/C with 10% ionic liquid at an overpotential of 40 mV are 2.81 and 4.15 times, respectively, higher than that of the pristine Pt/C. More importantly, ionic liquid-decoration significantly improves the long-term stability of Pt nanoparticles. After 8 h of chronoamperometric measurements, [DBU-FI]@Pt/C and [BMIm]@Pt/C can still retain 83.7% and 78.3% of their original activity, respectively, which is much higher than that of the pristine Pt/C (24.4%). The improved performance of Pt/C decorated with ionic liquid is considered to arise from the improved proton conductivity (particularly for protic ionic liquid) and hydrophobic microenvironment created by the supported ionic liquid phase. The presence of ionic liquid layer not only de-coordinates H* from hydronium ions nearby the Pt nanoparticles, but it also protects Pt nanoparticles from dissolution in the acidic media.

Herein, FeP/FeNi2P encapsulated in N, P co-doped hierarchical carbon (FeNiP-NPHC) in situ grown on nickel foam is fabricated via a hydrothermal-pyrolysis-phosphidation procedure. Benefiting from the strong coupling effect among FeP, FeNi2P, and N, P co-doped carbon at the three-phase heterojunction interface, as well as the unique 1D/3D hierarchical structure, the as-prepared FeNiP-NPHC shows superior ORR (E-1/2 = 0.83 V), HzOR (E-100 = 7 mV), and HER (E-100 = -180 mV) performance in alkaline seawater. Density functional theory functions indicate that constructing three-phase heterojunction interface of FeNiP-NPHC can effectively adjust the d-band center and electronic structure, which is conductive to balance and optimize the trifunctional electrocatalytic performance. As proof of concept, the self-assembled DHzFC is utilized to power the OHzS in alkaline seawater successfully, verifying application potential of the FeNiP-NPHC as trifunctional electrocatalyst.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000848442400001

It is shown that the formation of a layer of nickel hydroxide depends on the surface treatment of the nickel electrode, Even on a freshly polished electrode a hydroxide deposit was hardly obtained from an anodic polarization; cathodic prepolarization was required to obtain formation of nickel hydroxide. The quantity of nickel hydroxide electrochemically generated is related to the potential value and the duration of the cathodic treatment. The set of experimental data issued from this voltammetric study is used for comparison with the computed values obtained by digital simulation. The general multiple electrode reaction model used for these calculations is presented here. It involves the formation of nickel hydroxide according to a nucleation and growth mechanism, and redox reactions such as nickel hydroxide reversible arrow nickel oxyhydroxide, hydrogen and oxygen evolution.

J	MacDonald, SM; Roscoe, SG								Electrochemical oxidation reactions of tyrosine, tryptophan and related dipeptides								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				42	8			1189	1200		10.1016/S0013-4686(96)00285-X				1997	1997	The electrochemical oxidation reactions of tyrosine, tryptophan, tyrosyl-glycine and tryptophyl-glycine were investigated at a platinum electrode in a phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Cyclic voltammetry was used to examine the adsorption behaviour of these compounds. Strong adsorption was displayed by all four species at the electrode surface, and it appears that at low anodic potentials the amino acids are arranged predominantly in a horizontal position, but rearrange to a vertical configuration to allow for tighter packing at the higher potentials. Steady-state polarization measurements gave Tafel slopes in the range of 303-359 mV above the inflection point, considerably higher than those normally seen for oxygen evolution from a phosphate buffer solution. These results suggest that in the pH 7.0 buffer, the negatively charged carboxylate group preferentially adsorbs under these anodic potentials in a mechanism similar to the Kolbe reaction, with the decarboxylation step being rate determining. Cleavage of the dipeptide occurred in electrolysis experiments at potentials of 1.8-2.2V (E(SCE)), as determined by HPLC product analysis. However, quantitative measurements indicated that cleavage of the dipeptide was not the predominant pathway in the anodic oxidation process. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

With the temperature increasing, the conversion rate of fuel-N to NO decreased as the coke was burning in the granules, due to the effect of sintering materials. This presented the contrary law compared with the fuel burning alone. As coke burnt at temperature below 1 000 degrees C, it was mainly the oxidizing reaction between fuel-N and oxygen. Iron ores and fluxes getting in touch with coke could promote the oxidation of fuel-N that converts to NO. While the temperature increased to higher than 1 000 degrees C, the gasification reaction between carbon and CO2 occurred apparently and generated CO. There was a competition between fuel-N's oxidation and NO's reduction. Meanwhile, iron oxide and calcium ferrite (CE) had a catalytic effect on NO-CO reduction reaction. Particularly, the CF generated at high temperature had the most significant catalytic activity. As a consequence, the transformation of fuel-N was inhibited, making NO emission less at higher temperature.									16	2	0	0	0	0	16			0915-1559	1347-5460		WOS:000426225900005

Simple and facile sacrificial hard template strategy was utilized. Firstly, the distribution of TiO2 in the hollow spheres was controlled by loading aqueous solution of 2,3, and 5 mol/LTiCl4 precursor respectively onto carbonaceous template followed by annealing. To prove the Fe3+ ions radial penetration into the hydrophobic core of carbonaceous template, we optimized the ethanol to water ratio. The Fe2TiO5-TiO2 yolk-shell hollow spheres exhibited high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate up to 148 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) under UV-vis light. This was attributed to the better light harvesting due to the geometry of hollow sphere; charge separation by a thin shell yolk hetero-junction, a void cavity to access reaction solvent to reactive sites and the hetero-junction of Fe-O-Ti in the hollow structure. These findings suggest that our designed Fe2TiO5-TiO2 yolk-shell hollow spheres are beneficial for the photocatalytic water oxidation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we evaluate the AEMFC performance of commercial PtRu/C, as-synthesized PtRu/C, and Pd-CeO2/C catalysts as anodes and commercial Pt/C and as-synthesized N-doped carbon catalysts as cathodes. The evolution of cell performance with varying cathode catalyst layer compositions, back pressure, and dew points is underscored. The as-synthesized PtRu/C catalyst is characterized by advanced transmission electron microscopy and showed significantly high performance reaching a peak power density of 1900 mW cm(-2) at 80 degrees C with remarkably promising initial stability. We further showed the cell performances using Pd-CeO2/C anodes paired with both standard Pt/C and metal-free N-doped carbon as a cathodes, which resulted in peak power densities of 890 and 537 mW cm(-2), respectively. Data reported in this study sheds light on the development of AEMFCs using PGM and PGM-free catalysts.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-8488	1433-0768		WOS:000837935600001

We report here an electrolyzer that reduces 3.0 M KHCO3(aq) into CO(g) at a high rate (partial current density for CO of 220 mA cm-2) and a CO2 utilization efficiency of 40%, at a voltage of merely 2.3 V. These results were made possible by using: (i) a reactive carbon solution enriched in KHCO3 as the feedstock instead of gaseous CO2; (ii) a cation exchange membrane instead of an anion exchange membrane, which is common to the field; and (iii) the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) at the anode instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The voltage reported here is the lowest reported for any CO2 to CO electrolyzer that operates at high current densities (i.e., a partial current density for CO greater than 200 mA cm-2) with a CO2 utilization efficiency of greater than 20%. This study highlights how the choice of feedstock, membrane, and anode chemistries affects the rate and efficiency at which CO2 is converted into products.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2374-7943	2374-7951		WOS:000816922100001	35756379

In semiconductor photocatalysts, the light available to the reactions is usually limited to UV or visible with wavelengths shorter than the absorption edge of the semiconductors. On the other hand, gold nanoparticle (Au NP)-based plasmonic photocatalysts, particularly hot-electron transfer (HET)-type plasmonic photocatalysts, have the capability to utilize visible-to-near infrared light that makes up most sunlight as a driving force for the energetically uphill reactions. In recent years, experimental and theoretical studies on HET-type plasmonic photocatalysts consisting of Au NPs and a semiconductor have been intensively pursued. This perspective article highlights the fundamentals and recent progress of Au NP-based HET-type plasmonic photocatalysts for OER. After the introduction, the basics for the rational design of plasmonic photocatalysts are treated first. Secondly, the concrete design for the plasmonic photocatalysts is dealt with in the order of semiconductors, Au NPs, and their interface. Thirdly, recent advanced studies on plasmonic photocatalysts for OER are described. Finally, the conclusions are summarized with a direction for future research on plasmonic photocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000754041700001	35147621

However,there is little research on the reaction mechanism and reaction path of photolysis of water at present. In this study,GeZnNO catalysts were prepared by solid-state synthesis, some of which were modified with RuO_2. The catalysts were characterized by XRD,BET,UV-vis-DRS,PL and other methods. With the addition of the possible intermediate product H_2O_2 to the entire photocatalytic water splitting system,and the observation on changes of·OH and O2 respectively,it was preliminarily proved that H_2O_2 was an intermediate product of water splitting,which were further verified by the addition of Fe~(3+). The results show that H_2O_2 is an intermediate product of oxygen generated in the photocatalytic water splitting reaction system and plays an important role in the entire water splitting. At the same time,it was found that the RuO_2 promoter could not only function as a hydrogen evolution site,but also catalyze the decomposition of H_2O_2 to produce O2. The research results can provide a theoretical reference for the further improvement of photocatalytic water splitting performance.			光催化水分解生成氢气和氧气是解决环境污染和能源危机的方法之一,但当前对光解水的反应机理研究较少.本文通过进一步研究反应路径,以期为合成高效率光解水反应光催化剂提供新思路.采用固态合成法制备了GeZnNO可见光催化剂,并对部分催化剂进行RuO_2改性.同时,通过XRD、BET、UV-vis-DRS、PL等方法对催化剂进行表征.在整个光催化水分解体系中加入可能的中间产物H_2O_2,分别观察·OH和O2的变化,初步证明H_2O_2是水分解中间产物,并提出相应水分解反应机理.通过在整个光催化水分解体系中加入Fe~(3+),观察·OH和O2的变化,进一步验证了前面的推测.最终结果表明,H_2O_2是光催化水分解反应体系中氧气生成的中间产物,对整个水分解起着重要作用.同时发现, RuO_2助催化剂不仅具有析氢位点的作用,还能够催化H_2O_2分解产生O2,促进水分解的进行.该研究结果可为光催化水分解性能的进一步提高提供理论参考.						0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0253-2468			CSCD:7259455		
J	Kim, In Ho; Lim, Joonwon; Kim, Sang Ouk								Discovery of Single-Atom Catalyst: Customized Heteroelement Dopants on Graphene								ACCOUNTS OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				2	6			394	406		10.1021/accountsmr.1c00016		MAY 2021		JUN 25 2021	2021	CONSPECTUS: Single-atomic catalyst (SAC) incorporated in graphene plays an increasingly significant role in many applications, including sustainable energy conversion/storage and environmental systems. Such a synergistic structure commonly consisting of atomic metal active sites stabilized on a robust graphene support, is breaking through the intrinsic limitations of precious-metal-based catalysts and broadening a spectrum of applications, while attaining high atom utilization, remarkable novel catalytic activity, and conformational flexibility. Motivated from the unprecedented attractive features of SAC in graphene, enormous research efforts have been devoted to the development of this ultimate catalytic system. For the further advance and eventual success in this field, a general rule for the rational design of SAC is the first prerequisite. Unfortunately, the research effort for the exploration of the fundamental reaction mechanism and rational design principle has been frequently overlooked in spite of the significantly accumulated research efforts thus far.In this Account, we highlight a new perspective for the rational design of SAC in graphene, conceptually centered on the atomistic level heteroelement dopants of graphene. To provide the intuitive viewpoint on the SAC from the scientific perspective, we suggest a new classification scheme for versatile SACs reported thus far into "dopant catalyst" and "dopant-assisted catalyst", based on the detailed role of dopant in the catalyst system. Thereafter, we highlight the crucial influencing factors on the catalytic activity of the dopant-induced-catalyst system and toward rational designing rule for high performance catalysts. The recent progress in the dopant-induced-catalyst system for a wide spectrum of catalytic applications, including oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, and CO2 reduction is summarized. Finally, we briefly discuss the challenges and opportunities for the future research direction. The exciting expectation for the well-defined, specifically tailored, high performance dopant-induced-catalyst system is anticipated to address global challenges, including climate change, energy crisis and worldwide pandemics.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3				2643-6728		WOS:000668366300003

Recently, this topic has attracted a lot of attention because it clearly shows that adaptation occurs even at the higher stages of visual cortical processing. However, during our every-day life, faces do not appear in isolation, rather they are usually surrounded by other stimuli. Here, we used psychophysical and fMRI adaptation methods to test whether humans adapt to the gender properties of a composite multiple face stimulus as well. As adaptors we used stimuli composed of eight different individual faces, positioned peripherally in a ring around a fixation mark. We found that the gender discrimination of a subsequent centrally presented target face is significantly biased as a result of long-term adaptation to either male or female multiple face stimuli. Similar to our previous results with single-face adaptors (Kovacs et al. in Neuroimage 43(1):156-164, 2008), a concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation experiment revealed the strongest blood oxygen level-dependent signal adaptation bilaterally in the fusiform face area. Our results suggest that humans extract the statistical features of the multiple face stimulus and this process occurs at the level of occipito-temporal face processing.									6	0	0	0	4	0	6			0014-4819	1432-1106		WOS:000306424100007	22673875

The crystal-facet effect is currently rare in the field of electrocatalysis and a deep understanding of the catalytic mechanism of bimetallic highly active crystal facets is critical for fabricating high-performance catalysts, but details are still lacking. Herein, we demonstrated a solvent-induced strategy to manufacture well-defined structured CoNi-layered double hydroxides (LHDs) for highly efficient water electrolysis, and gave a detailed mechanism of catalytic activity towards an enhanced OER. Such considerable improvement in catalytic activity was attributed not only to the synergistic catalytic effect of bimetallic hydroxides, but also to the crystal-facet effect, which is caused by the high density of unsaturated-coordination of surface metal atoms. Consequently, the adsorption energy was enhanced and the activation energy of the target reaction was lowered. These unsaturated coordination surface or edge metal atoms can be easily oxidized to form a great amount of active oxyhydroxides, such as beta-NiOOH intermediates. In addition, the adjacent Co sites can also regulate the redox reaction kinetics of Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH and synergistically catalyze the OER.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			2052-1553			WOS:000851219500001

However, SSCs are susceptible to undergo restructuring during the reactions. Exploring the active sites of catalysts through in situ characterization techniques plays a critical role in studying reaction mechanism and guiding the design of optimum catalysts. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy/small-angle X-ray scattering (XAS/SAXS) is promising and widely used for monitoring electronic structure, atomic configuration, and size changes of SSCs during real-time working conditions. Unfortunately, there is no detailed summary of XAS/SAXS characterization results of SSCs. The recent advances in applying in situ XAS/SAXS to SSCs are thoroughly summarized in this review, including the atomic structure and oxidation state variations under open circuit and realistic reaction conditions. Furthermore, the reversible transformation of single-atom catalysts (SACs) to subnanoclusters/nanoparticles and the application of in situ XAS/SAXS in subnanoclusters are discussed. Finally, the outlooks in modulating the SSCs and developing operando XAS/SAXS for SSCs are highlighted.									22	1	0	0	1	0	23			2366-9608			WOS:000617133700001	34928104

Among the best performing noble/precious metal electrocatalysts, Ru is most notable because it acts as an excellent electrocatalyst for both oxidation and reduction reactions of water responsible for the H-2 production. In fact, Ru outperforms Pt/C as the state-of-the-art water reduction electrocatalyst in alkali. However, the cost-wise more expensive Ru (than Pt and Ir) could not be extensively used in water electrolysis to avoid further increase in the cost of H-2 production. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in Ru and is being intensively investigated with various structural and chemical modifications at the nano-level for catalytic water electrolysis with and without other materials. However, there is no comprehensive review that summarizes and analyzes recent developments in water splitting electrocatalysts that are modulated with Ru. Hence, this review is devoted to bringing out the strategies involved in harvesting the best of water splitting electrocatalysts by Ru-tweaking. The same is also benchmarked against their performance at different conditions. Besides, a detailed note on water splitting electrocatalysis and mechanisms involving Ru are given with insights on the phenomena that make it an active interface for water electrolysis.									21	1	0	0	0	0	21			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000632069500006

In this work, a two-step method was used to synthesize high-entropy phosphate/ carbon (HEPi/C) hybrid nanosheets for the first time. First, high-entropy metal-organic framework (HE-MOF) nanosheets were synthesized by an entropy-driven mechanochemical method at room temperature, and then high-temperature phosphating is performed. HEPi/C hybrid nanosheets exhibit excellent HER performance in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, the overpotential of 40 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) is lower than that of commercial Pt/C (eta(10) = 48 mV), and has excellent catalytic stability. More interestingly, at an overpotential of 50 mV, the mass activity of the HEPi/C hybrid nanosheets is as high as 1.6 A mg(noble metal)(-1). This work provides an attractive non-Pt-based material for acidic HER, and also provides a new idea for designing highly efficient and stable hybrid materials composed of high-entropy materials and carbon for electrocatalytic applications.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000821032500004

However, the large variety of defects, each with its own distinct and usually unknown effects, complicates the design and optimization of such defective materials. Therefore, it is relevant to characterize in detail the effect of individual defects and to be able to combine these observations to describe more complex materials, such as those seen experimentally. Therefore, nine point defects (antisites defects and vacancies) are theoretically studied on single layer 1T, 1T ', and 2H MoS2 polymorphs, and the variation and spatial distribution in the active sites are identified. It is found that all defective 1T ' monolayers exhibit an increase in the exchange current density of at least 2.3 times when compared to pristine 1T ' MoS2, even if a reduced number of active sites are observed. The results are later used to propose a methodology to study materials containing a mixture of crystal phases, or other alterations that cause inhomogeneous changes in the activity of catalytic sites.									9	0	0	0	0	0	9				2513-0390		WOS:000508585100001

Tungsten foils were oxidized in a furnace at 400 degrees C for 1 h, so a compact oxide film with the thickness of about 160 nm was formed. The samples were then exposed to hydrogen plasma created in a microwave discharge at the power of 1000 W and a hydrogen pressure of 90 Pa. The plasma density was estimated to the order of 10(16) m(-3), whereas the density of neutral hydrogen atoms was 2.5 x 10(21) m(-3) measured by a fiber optics catalytic probe. Samples were exposed to hydrogen plasma for different time. The evolution of the reduction process was monitored by measuring the AES depth profiles on samples exposed to plasma for different time. The results showed that the oxide film was reduced in about 10 s of plasma treatment. The average removal rate was thus about 16 nm s(-1). Such a high reduction rate cannot be explained by the interaction of hydrogen ions, because the ion flux onto the sample surface is orders of magnitude too low, but rather by the interaction of neutral H-atoms with the oxide film. Taking into account the known reduction rate and H-atom density, one can estimate the reaction probability to about 3 x 10(-4).

Regrettably, the sluggish alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) hampers advances in fuel cells. Herein, we report a Pt/Ni3N-Mo2C bifunctional electrocatalyst toward HOR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Pt/Ni3N-Mo2C exhibits remarkable HOR/HER performance in alkaline media. The mass activity at 50 mV and exchange current density of HOR are 5.1 and 1.5 times that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, it possesses an impressive HER activity with an overpotential of 11 mV @ 10 mA cm(-2), which is lower than that of Pt/C and most reported electrocatalysts under the same conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with experimental results reveal that Pt/Ni3N-Mo2C not only possesses an optimal balance between hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and OH- adsorption but also facilitates water adsorption and dissociation on the catalyst surface, which contribute to the excellent HOR/HER performance. Thus, this work may guide bifunctional HOR/HER catalyst design in the conversion and transport of energy.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			1948-7185			WOS:000772195200008	35225609

However, alkaline HER suffers from sluggish reaction kinetics because of the additional energy required for water dissociation from catalysts in contrast to acidic HER. Herein, we report the development of two-dimensional metal-organic framework (2D MOF) Ni-1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid-based composite nanosheets for superior performance in HER electrocatalysis. Iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecules are uniformly anchored on the ultrathin 2D Ni-MOF, showing a substantially increased current density, improved activity, and enhanced durability in alkaline HER. On account of the ultralarge specific surface of Ni-MOF and the coupling effects between FePc and 2D MOFs, the resultant nanosheet catalyst FePc@Ni-MOF exhibits a low overpotential (334 mV) and satisfactory long-term stability (10 h) at a current density of 10 mA.cm(-2), which outperform those of pristine FePc, Ni-MOF, and the counterpart FePc@bulk-MOF. This study provides new insights into the synthesis of robust MOF-based nanosheet composites with high performance in catalysis.									13	0	0	0	0	0	13			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000671099600072	34114800

However, the continuous activation of Li2MnO3 in Li-rich Mn-based materials, which correlates with O-2 release and TM migration, is usually unfavorable to structural stability. Herein, based on a gas-solid interface reaction, we tackle this continuous activation phenomenon by restricting the capacity release of Li2MnO3 via NH4HCO3 treatment in the Li1.2Ni0.36Mn0.44O2 cathode. After modification, oxygen vacancies associated with the spinel phase are introduced on the surface. The 4 mol % NH4HCO3-modified material's capacity starts at 182 mAh g(-1) at 1 C instead of increasing from 173 to 186 mAh g(-1) for 25 cycles in the pristine material. Meanwhile, it also exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 93.24% after 200 cycles (at 1 C), with a small voltage decay rate of 1.19 mV cycle(-1).									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			1944-8244	1944-8252		WOS:000693050200078	34415716

The as-prepared NC-3 delivers a high specific surface area (609.10 m(2) g(-1)), pore volume (0.68 cm(3) g(-1)) and nitrogen content (7.20 at. %). Reasonably, NC-3 possesses more positive on-set potential (0.132 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and half-wave potential (-0.041 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Furthermore, the output voltage and maximum power density of NC-3 coated as cathode in microbial fuel cell (MFC) are enhanced to 533.65 +/- 12.09 mV and 471.82 +/- 15.39 mW m(-2), respectively. Noted that NC-3 (2.15 x 10(-3) $ g(-1)) also shows nice long-term stability and anti-poisoning to methanol, and is nearly 100,000 times cheaper than commercial Pt/C (20 wt %, 220.04 $ g(-1)). Therefore, NC-3 should be a very promising ORR catalyst in the application of MFC. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Exploring low-cost ORR catalysts with high activity and long-term stability is highly desirable, although it still remains challenging. Herein, we report a facile and reliable route to convert ZIF-8 modified by Fe-phenanthroline into Fe-incorporated and N-doped carbon dodecahedron nanoarchitecture (Fe-NCDNA), in which carbon nanosheets are formed in situ as the building blocks with uniform Fe-N-C species decoration. Systematic electrochemical studies demonstrate that the as-synthesized Fe-NCDNA electrocatalyst possesses highly attractive catalytic features toward the ORR in terms of activity and durability in both alkaline and neutral media. The Zn-air battery with the optimal Fe-NCDNA catalyst as the cathode performs impressively, delivering a power density of 184 mW cm(-2) and a specific capacity of 801 mAh g(-1); thus, it exhibits great competitive advantages over those of the Zn-air devices employing a Pt-based cathode electrocatalyst.

Herein, an effective synthetic strategy for the construction of MoO2 nanoflowers decorated with metallic Cu/Cu2O nanoparticles (NPs) on Ni foam (NF) (Cu2O/MoO2@Cu/NF) with a simple two-step method is reported. The prepared Cu2O/MoO2@Cu/NF as an electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding reactivity and remarkable stability in alkaline solution. The onset overpotential of Cu2O/MoO2@Cu/NF approaches 0 V. An overpotential as low as 32 mV is obtained to afford a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), comparable with Pt/C catalysts. The Tafel slope is low at 40 mV dec(-1) as well. The involvement of zero-valent Cu greatly reduces the resistance. The well-dispersed Cu/Cu2O NPs on the sphere-like MoO2 nanoflowers exaggerate the surface area. The ringent channels provide the fast release of evolved bubbles. Furthermore, the enhanced conductivity and large surface area lead to significant activity in HER. Herein, a novel design and facile synthesis of a highly efficient electrocatalyst with catalytic activity that is comparable to a Pt/C catalyst is provided.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			2194-4288	2194-4296		WOS:000535905600001

Proton reduction to form hydrogen in ILs is highly sensitive to the surface state of the platinum electrode, requiring oxidative preconditioning at similar to 2 V versus Fc/Fc(+) (Fc = ferrocene) to activate the electrode and achieve reproducible voltammetry. The hydrogen evolution reaction at a preconditioned electrode in ILs has been simulated by combining the classical Volmer, H+ + e- = H* (E-1(0),k(s,1),alpha 1), and Heyrovsky reactions, H+ + H* + e- = H-2 (E-2(0),ks,(2),alpha(2)), where E-0, k(s), and a are the standard potential, standard heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant, and charge transfer coefficient, respectively. The Volmer reaction is the rate-determining step on platinum in IL media and the formal potential of the H+/H-2 process is insensitive to the identity of the IL cation, lying at approximately -30 mV with respect to the Fc/Fc(+) process. Proton transport in the ILs investigated obeys the StokesEinstein equation. Furthermore, the proton diffusion coefficient (measured electrochemically) is essentially identical to the self-diffusion coefficient of [NTf2]- (measured with pulsed field gradient spinecho NMR), indicating that the protons are transported as undissociated H[NTf2]. The Stokes radius of H[NTf2] is estimated to be 3.24 angstrom from the slope of a StokesEinstein plot, in agreement with the literature. Proton transport in propylene carbonate follows the same Stokesian relationship, implying that H[NTf2] also is not dissociated in this molecular solvent. Finally, proton transport in water follows the well-established Grotthuss mechanism, as expected. Although we have shown that there is no Grotthuss-like proton conduction mechanism operating in the investigated ILs, this work lays the foundation for further studies on proton reduction, activity, and transport in this class of solvent. Ultimately, the goal is to develop an IL formulation which facilitates facile anhydrous proton conduction over a wide temperature range.									24	1	0	0	1	0	24			1932-7447			WOS:000347360200023

In this study, we prepare Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH by surface treatment in acid solution using oxidation-corrosion equilibrium (OCE). For comparison, we also treat Ni foam with the same process in alkaline solution. Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH can achieve steady morphology and metallization by OCE and exhibits superior catalytic activity as a water oxidation catalyst. Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH(OCE) needs only 232 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), while it is 254 mV for a reference IrO2/Ni foam. The mechanism study shows that the small charge transfer resistance (2.04 Omega cm(2)) is favorable for the rapid interface electron exchange between Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH(OCE) and reactive species in water oxidation. In addition, the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and series impedance show that the catalyst is metallic in property in virtue of the exposed metal Ni in Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH(OCE). The volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen (around 2:1) indicates overall water splitting by the double-electrode system. When the volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 2:1, the Faraday efficiency of H-2 or O-2 is close to 100%. Ni(OH)(2)center dot NiO/FeOOH(OCE) exhibits good stability for 1 month. The research results provide a feasible approach for finding low-cost metallized catalysts to replace noble metals as water oxidation catalysts and improving the efficiency of water splitting.									0	1	0	0	0	0	1			2574-0962			WOS:000669533800027

Unlike the typical sandwiched structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), layered A(III)B(VI) chalcogenides like InSe and GaSe are composed of X-M-M-X motif where M is gallium/indium and X is sulfur/selenium/tellurium. The exception is InS, which adopt an orthorhombic 3D structure. Herein, we studied and compared the inherent electrochemical properties as well as the electrocatalytic performances towards hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of indium monochalcogenides (InS, InSe and InTe). Inherent electrochemistry studies in phosphate buffered saline electrolyte showed that InS did not exhibit any inherent electrochemical signals when compared to bare glassy carbon electrode. However, InSe showed a reduction peak at -1.6 V while InTe had an oxidation peak at 0.2 V. The heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rates of indium monochalcogenides were measured with [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox probe using cyclic voltammetry (vs. Ag/AgCl) at the scan rate of 100 mV s(-1). It was found that InTe exhibited the best electrochemical performance with the fastest HET rate with highest kobs0 obtained (3.7x10(-3) cm s(-1)). InS showed the best electrocatalytic performance for HER with the lowest overpotential value of 0.92 V at current density of -10 mA cm(-2). However, the performances of indium monochalcogenides were almost comparable to that of bare glassy carbon electrode and do not exhibit any improvements in electrocatalytic capabilities. This study provides insights into the electrochemical properties and electrocatalytic performances of layered A(III)B(VI) indium monochalcogenides which would influence potential applications.									13	1	0	0	0	0	13			1867-3880	1867-3899		WOS:000470937300009

Herein, a Co-based POM was investigated for modifying Fe2O3 photoanodes. The photogenerated carriers of Fe2O3 have a fundamental effect on Co8POM. Ultrathin CoOx overlayer derived from Co8POM is confirmed as the true active species, which was prepared by a simple photodeposition method. This CoOx nanolayer effectively restrains the surface states on the hematite nanorod and reduces the water oxidation overpotential. Our CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode affords the best PEC performance and the highest photovoltage when compared with pristine Fe2O3 photoanode and CoOx(salt)/Fe2O3 photoanode prepared by a simple cobalt salt. The photocurrent density of CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 photoanode is 2.2 times higher than that of pristine Fe2O3 photoanodes. Meanwhile, the CoOx(POM)/Fe2O3 composite photoanode achieves faster transient photoresponse and an improved charge injection efficiency of 80%.									42	2	0	0	2	0	42			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000463970400040

PEDOT is a conducting polymer that shows catalytic activity for the formation and dissociation of Li2O2 in Li-O-2 cells. The microflower morphology composed of intertwined nanofibers is expected to increase the number of active sites for the redox reaction during the discharging-charging process. Although the electronic conductivity of the PEDOT microflowers is not so low, it is insufficient to achieve a large capacity for the electrode material in Li-O-2 cells. Thus, a composite was prepared using 5-20 wt% of graphene as the matrix to compensate for the low conductivity of the PEDOT microflowers. The electrode employing the PEDOT microflower/graphene composite presents much higher capacity than that of the electrode employing pristine PEDOT microflowers, because of the enhanced electronic conductivity. Moreover, the electrode shows enhanced cycle performance compared to that of the electrode employing pristine graphene. This is because the microflower surface can suppress the side reactions activated by carbon, thereby reducing the accumulation of unwanted reaction products on the electrode.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5				2046-2069		WOS:000418373300071

Then flowerlike three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures are formed, with successful synthesis of corresponding Pt/MnO2 nanocomposites. The obtained nanocomposites are characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, an interesting color change phenomenon appeared with the Pt nucleation and growth progress which may be due to variation of the Mn valence state triggered by the reduction of Pt. This phenomenon can be used for naked-eye observation of materials' growth states which is beneficial for investigation of synthetic mechanisms. At last, the Pt/MnO2 3D nanostructure exhibits perfect electrocatalytic properties toward oxidation 3h of methanol. The four kinds of Pt/MnO2 composites are all used for electrochemical catalytic sensing of methanol respectively which indicates that the morphology of nanomaterials determines the catalytic properties. This research provides a new platform for controllable synthesis of nanomaterials and investigation of electrocatalysis based on morphology controlled nanomaterials.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2168-0485			WOS:000382713100048

The oxides are in situ dispersed in the polymerization reaction mixture during the synthesis stage of the phenolic film. The maximum Coulombic energy efficiency, overall H-2 recovery and cathodic recovery of the CeO2-rGO/carbon film-based MEC are measured to be approximately 95, 93 and 98%, respectively at 1 V (Ag/ AgCl), whereas COD reduction in the wastewater is measured to be approximately 95%. The improved hydrogen evolution and organic degradation are attributed to the electroconductive graphitic rGO and photocatalytic CeO2, respectively.

Ethene adsorbs with a high probability over the temperature range 130 to 800 K with the low-coverage sticking probability dropping from 0.8 at 130 K to 0.35 at 800 K. The adsorption is of the precursor type, with a weakly held form of ethene being the intermediate between the gas phase and strong chemisorption. Dehydrogenation begins at similar to300 K and is fast above 350 K. If adsorption is carried out at temperatures up to similar to380 K, adsorption saturates after about 0.25 monolayer have adsorbed, but above similar to450 K, adsorption continues at a high rate with continuous hydrogen evolution and C deposition onto the surface. It appears that, in the intermediate temperature range, the carbonaceous species formed is located in the top layer and thus interferes with adsorption, whereas the C goes subsurface above 450 K, the adsorption is almost unaffected, and the C signal is significantly attenuated in XPS. However, the deposited carbon can easily be removed again by reaction with oxygen, thus implying that the carbon remains in the selvedge, that is, in the immediate subsurface region probably consisting of a few atomic layers. No well-ordered structures are identified in either LEED or STM, though some evidence of a c(2x2) structure can be seen. The Pd surface, at least above 450 K, appears to act as a "sponge" for carbon atoms, and this effect is also seen for the adsorption of other hydrocarbons such as acetaldehyde and acetic acid.									51	1	0	0	0	0	51			1520-6106	1520-5207		WOS:000226956300040	16851232	
J	Xu, Hui; Zhao, Yitao; Wang, Qing; He, Guangyu; Chen, Haiqun								Supports promote single-atom catalysts toward advanced electrocatalysis								COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS				451						214261	10.1016/j.ccr.2021.214261		OCT 2021		JAN 15 2022	2022	Single-atom catalysts (SACs) offer high reactivity and selectivity toward catalytic reaction while maximizing the utilization of active components. Unfortunately, single-atom sites are susceptible to sintering and agglomerating into thermodynamically stable nanoclusters due to their high surface energy. Introducing appropriate supports to optimize the local coordination environment and electronic properties, as well as induce strong metal-support interactions (SMSI), is essential to preventing sintering. Although a range of potential SACs with low-cost supports are emerging as promising candidates for heterogeneous catalysis, the real roles and key factors of supports that govern the catalytic properties of these SACs remain ambiguous. Aiming at understanding the bonding between atomic sites and supports and how this relates to the catalytic performance, we herein summarize the recent experimental and computational efforts of SACs toward electrocatalysis. Moreover, the real role of the support in the SACs plays in affecting the electrocatalytic reaction is also emphasized. Furthermore, before ending this review, we have also proposed the prospects and challenges of the advanced SACs for the application in the field of electrocatalytic energy conversion.

Synergistic electronic and morphological structures of the catalyst have been considered as an effective method to improve the catalytic performance, due to the enhanced intrinsic activity and enlarged accessible active sites. Herein, we present novel ternary Co1-xVxP nano-needle arrays with modulated electronic and morphological structures as an electrocatalyst for highly efficient HER in alkaline solution. The NF@Co1-xVxP catalyst shows a remarkable catalytic ability with low overpotentials of 46 and 226 mV at current densities of 10 and 400 mA cm(-2), respectively, as well as a small Tafel slope and superior stability. Combining the experimental and computational study, the excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the improved physical and chemical properties (conductivity and surface activity), large active surface area, and fast reaction kinetics. Furthermore, the assembled Co-V based electrolyzer (NF@Co1-xVx-HNNs(+)||NF@Co1-xVxP(-)) delivers small full-cell voltages of 1.58, 1.75, and 1.92 V at 10, 100, and 300 mA cm(-2), respectively. Our findings provide a systematic understanding on the V-incorporation strategy to promote highly efficient ternary electrocatalysts via synergistic control of morphology and electronic structures.									12	1	0	0	0	0	12			2095-8226	2199-4501		WOS:000585996400002

In this decade, Fe-based atomic catalysts have exhibited great advantages toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to the high utilization efficiency of their single/dual atomic sites, well-defined active sites and high selectivity toward the four-electron (4e(-)) pathway. To explore their catalytic behavior, many efforts have been made to synthesize Fe-based atomic catalysts. In addition, the high performance of Fe-based single/dual atoms toward ORR is mainly attributed to the critical coordination condition and the corresponding electronic structures. Currently, it is a great challenge to achieve high activity and good stability with a high content of metal atoms, while maintaining their atomic dispersion. In this review, we begin with a systematic review about the influence of the coordination environment of Fe-based single/dual-atom catalysts on their electrocatalytic properties, followed by an overview of some new strategies to improve their coordination environment. Then, we present a comprehensive summary on the advantages of their unique structures, catalytic activity for the ORR and further applications. Finally, the remaining key challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are concluded to provide more useful clues for the development of advanced catalysts.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000681405200001

Here, we report that SrTiO3 nanofibers that have been treated with a brief method of H-2 calcination in an H-2/N-2 atmosphere (denoted as STO-NH) form oxygen vacancies (OVs) and achieve significant improvement in performance in photocatalytic H-2 production without the presence of cocatalysts. These OVs can trap photogenerated electrons, which inhibits the recombination of electrons and holes in both the surface and the bulk, thus improving the photocatalytic decomposition of water. Moreover, the concentration of surface OVs in STO-NH presents volcanic characteristics: the increase with rise in hydrogenation temperature, with a consequent increase in catalytic activity, indicates well-controlled formation of OVs. The existence and concentration of the OVs in STO-NH photocatalysts are investigated qualitatively through electron paramagnetic resonance, high-resolution transmission electron microscope and photoluminescence emission spectra. A reasonable photocatalytic mechanism is proposed that we expect to be able to provide significant guidance for future study.									54	2	0	0	7	0	54			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000477988200024

Several studies applying carbon and oxygen isotopes of stalagmites show a simultaneous increase of delta C-13 and delta O-18 along individual growth layers, which is interpreted as being indicative of isotope fractionation under disequilibrium conditions. In order to obtain robust paleoclimatic information from calcite precipitated under these non-equilibrium conditions it is important to improve the quantitative understanding of the corresponding isotope fractionation processes. Here we present laboratory experiments simulating calcite precipitation under cave-analogue conditions. The major focus was the investigation of the temporal evolution of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of the precipitated calcite for varying temperature, drip interval and initial SICaCo3.All experiments show an isotopic enrichment of both delta C-13 and delta O-18 with increasing distance from the point of drip water impinge. Longer drip intervals and higher temperatures result in a larger enrichment. In addition, the slope between delta O-18 and delta C-13 is lower for higher temperatures indicating faster oxygen isotope exchange between the water reservoir and the bicarbonate in the solution.In case of delta C-13, the fractionation factor between the precipitated calcite and the bicarbonate in the solution. (13)alpha(CaCo3)-HCO3-, shows a larger increase with higher temperatures in comparison to previous studies. This possibly indicates an increasing contribution of disequilibrium isotope fractionation processes for increasing temperatures, which are not accounted for by the equilibrium isotope fractionation factors. Furthermore, a quantitative determination of the calcite precipitation time, T-p, and the oxygen isotope exchange time between the bicarbonate and the water, T-b, yields faster reaction rates in comparison to previously published time constants, particularly at higher temperature (23 degrees C).

J	Huang, Jingbin; Jiang, Yan; An, Tianyun; Cao, Minhua								Increasing the active sites and intrinsic activity of transition metal chalcogenide electrocatalysts for enhanced water splitting								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				8	48			25465	25498		10.1039/d0ta08802a				DEC 28 2020	2020	Electrochemical water splitting has been regarded as a promising technique for facilitating the conversion of sustainable energy. To realize the large-scale application of water electrolysis, it is urgent and imperative to develop low-cost, earth-abundant, high-efficient, and stable electrocatalysts to substitute noble-metal-based catalysts. Among the various nonnoble-metal-based electrocatalysts, transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have attracted considerable attention in recent years in the field of electrochemical water splitting because of their unique structural and electronic properties. Nevertheless, the limited number of active sites as well as sluggish electrochemical kinetics severely impede their electrochemical performances. Some valid strategies, such as increasing the number of active sites and enhancing the intrinsic activity of each active site via extrinsic and intrinsic modifications, have been consequently adopted to enhance electrochemical activities. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the developed strategies in optimizing the electrocatalytic activities of TMCs is reviewed. A unique emphasis is placed on the promising strategies to regulate the electronic structures of TMCs by surface vacancy/defect, heteroatom doping, strain regulation, phase transition, and heterostructure engineering. Moreover, the intrinsic mechanistic analyses of the electronic structure, intermediate adsorption, and coordination environment are also presented via theoretical simulation and advanced characterization techniques. Remaining challenges and future perspectives for the further development of promising water-splitting systems are discussed, too.									53	2	0	0	3	0	53			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000601282900001

Herein, a new method for the in-operando monitoring of pH distribution in an electrochemical cell is demonstrated. A combination of pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, encompassing a wide pH range from approximate to 1.5 to 8.5, and rapid electrochemically coupled laser scanning confocal microscopy is used to observe pH changes in the cell. Using electrocoagulation as an example process, we show that the method provides new insights into the reaction mechanisms. The pH close to the aluminium electrode surface is influenced by the applied current density, hydrolysis of aluminium cations, and gas evolution. Through quantification of the pH at the anode, along with gas analysis, we find that hydrogen is evolved at the anode due to a non-Faradaic chemical reaction. This leads to increased production of coagulant, which may open new routes to enhance the process performance. This method for in-operando dynamic visualization of pH paves the way for studies of electrochemical processes, including other water treatment, electrosynthesis, and batteries.									37	1	0	0	9	0	37			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000489491500001	31538391

Nevertheless, its sluggish reaction kinetics and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction always result in limited ammonia yield and low faradaic efficiency (FE). In this work, an Fe-decorated porphyrinic metal-organic framework (MOF) is employed as a precursor to construct single-atom Fe implanted nitrogen-doped carbon catalysts (Fe-1-N-C) through a mixed ligand strategy. Benefiting from the highly dispersed single-atom Fe sites, hierarchically porous structure and good conductivity, Fe-1-N-C shows a FE of 4.51% and an ammonia yield rate of 1.56 x 10(-11) mol cm(-2) s(-1) at -0.05 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, superior to those of Co-1-N-C and Ni-1-N-C. Theoretical calculations reveal that Fe-1-N-C shows the lowest energy barrier of the rate-determining step during the NRR process, consistent with its highest activity obtained in experiments. This work reveals the unique potential of single-atom catalysts for the electrochemical NRR and provides in-depth insights into the catalytic mechanism of the NRR.									86	3	0	0	2	0	87			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000501213600017

However, the understanding of the atomic structures and orbital states underlying catalytic reactivity in amorphous iridium oxide oxygen evolving catalysts (Ir-OECs) is incomplete compared to that of crystalline oxides, owing to a lack of direct experimental verification. Here, we present experimental approaches using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) to directly access Ir 5d orbital excitations at the Ir L-3 edge and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements to characterize electronic and coordination structures at the atomic scale. The so-called iridium blue layer (IrBL) and IrOx were formed from the organometallic precursor complex [Cp*Ir(H2O)(3)]SO4 and the inorganic precursor IrCl3, respectively. Ex situ IrBL and IrOx films for RIXS and PDF measurements were prepared by conditioning electrodeposited films at a low voltage. The incident energy RIXS profile of IrOx exhibited extra weak resonantly enhanced excitation below 2 eV energy loss. The feature was clearly different from a single high-energy excitation above 3 eV of IrBL related to the interband transition between pi- and sigma-antibonding states. The atomic structure refinement based on PDF measurements revealed the atomic structure domains to have edge- and corner-shared IrO6 octahedra with trigonal-type distortion. Density functional theory calculations guided by the refined atomic structures shed light on the electronic structure corresponding to experimental results, including insulating and metallic phases in ex situ IrBL and IrOx films, respectively. Our study establishes different Ir 5d orbital states and atomic structures in two amorphous Ir oxide OER catalysts in their reduction states.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2155-5435			WOS:000684035000090

Herein, we report a three-dimensional hierarchical assembly structure composed of an ultrathin Ru shell and a Ru-Ni alloy core as a catalyst functioning under universal pH conditions. Compared with the typical WC-PVC system, superior catalytic performances and excellent durability of the overall water splitting under universal pH have been demonstrated. The introduction of Ni downshifts the d-band center of the Ru-Ni electrocatalysts, modulating the surface electronic environment. Density functional theory results reveal that the mutually restrictive d-band interaction lowers the binding of (Ru, Ni) and (H, O) for easier O-O and H-H formation. The structure -induced eg-dx(2) misalignment leads to minimization of surface Coulomb repulsion to achieve a barrier-free water-splitting process.									68	3	0	0	5	0	68				2589-0042		WOS:000456942200036	30684494

Co2P is synthesized through a one-step room-temperature electro-deposition technique that precludes the release of toxic PH3 gas, where the in situ processwarrants electron and mass transfer between Co2P and the underlying substrate for effective electrocatalytic reactions. Facilitated by thermionic energy harvested from sustainable solar irradiance conversion, the electrocatalytic behaviours of Co2P are remarkably increased. These superstructures are endowed with a higher electrical conductivity and electrochemical surface area, reduced activation energy and enhanced solar-to-heat conversion efficiency to accelerate electrocatalysis.									36	2	0	0	1	0	36			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000407641200009

Comprehensive gasification modeling of char particles with multi-modal pore structures								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				160	1			120	137		10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.09.007				JAN 2013	2013	Gasification and combustion of porous char particles occurs in many industrial applications. Reactor-scale outputs of importance depend critically on processes that occur at the particle-scale. Because char particles often possess a wide range of pore sizes and react under varying operating conditions, predictive models which can account for the numerous physical and chemical processes and time-dependent boundary conditions to which a particle is subjected are necessary. A comprehensive, transient, spherically symmetric model of a reacting, porous char particle entrained in the surrounding flow has been developed. The model incorporates the adaptive random pore model and consistent flux relations to account for an evolving, multi-modal pore structure. The model has been validated against zone II reaction data with good agreement. The framework allows for concurrent annealing, particle size reduction and the possibility of ash adherence to the particle surface, although the latter two submodels require the specification of several parameters. The ability of the model to calculate the evolution of temperature, species and porosity profiles for char, ash and the surrounding boundary layer has been demonstrated. The importance of accounting for multiple reactions and for different pore sizes separately has been illustrated through their effect on overall particle conversion.

The overpotential required to drive the HER at a current density of 10 mA/cm(2) is about 217 mV and that of 50 mA/cm(2) is about 267 mV with a small Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec for Co-Te-Se/MWCNT. Galvanostatic measurements and continuous potential cycles indicated the stability of Co-Te-Se/MWCNT. This development is potentially attractive earth-abundant electrocatalysts for HER and provides new opportunities for their application in water-splitting. (C) 2016 The Electrochemical Society.

Here, we systematically explored the HER catalytic performance of Ti2CO2, Ti3C2O2 and Ti3CNO2 modified by single transition metal atom via first-principles calculations. The modified catalysts behave outstanding catalytic performance with either the single atom or the O atom on the surfaces of MXenes as active sites when pH = 0. We found that Ti2CO2 doped with Cu, Ag and W at O site exhibit superb HER catalytic performance when pH = 0 with Gibbs free energies of hydrogen adsorption of -2.67*10-5, -2.78*10-4, and 3.37*10-4 eV, respectively. In addition, Cu and Pd directly anchoring on Ti2CO2 have dual-acitve-site mechanism for HER, indicating high efficiency. The enhanced performance for HER is attributed to the redistribution of electron after the introduction of single atom. Furthermore, Ti2CO2 doped with W at Ti site, Ti3C2O2 doped with Mo and W at Ti site, behave good catalytic performance via wide pH ranges under alkaline/neutral conditions. Their low water dissociation barriers imply excellent HER catalytic performance under both acidic and alkaline/ neutral conditions. These explorations bring new prospect to the potential of Ti-based MXenes in HER catalysis.									12	1	0	0	1	0	12			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663747500004

Herein, a porous and highly aligned molybdenum carbide nano-octahedron (PHA-Mo2C) is synthesized by using CdMoO4 octahedron precursor. The presence of cadmium and prereduction process play a crucial role in the formation of porous and highly aligned structure and the regulation of active crystal facet to enhance the HER activity. The effects of Cd on the crystal structure transition, regulation of active crystal facet and inhibition of carbon deposition are detailly characterized and theoretically calculated. The obtained PHA-Mo2C as electrocatalysts exhibit efficient HER activity with a low onset potential of -25 mV vs. RHE and an overpotential of 93 mV at the current density of -10 mA/cm(2), as well as ultra-high long-term catalytic stability in acidic electrolyte. The calculated ratio value of (200)/(121) crystal facets, defined as active face index (AFI), is proposed to evaluate the HER activity of Mo2C. This work provides a new strategy for cadmium engineering synthesis of efficient molybdenum carbide electrocatalysts with active crystal facet regulation and high electrochemical active area.									28	2	0	0	2	0	28			2211-2855	2211-3282		WOS:000581738300006

The chemical transformation was tracked quantitatively by combining the curve-fitting and second-derivative operations in Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy spectra. The aggregation and radial structural changes in the fibers were investigated by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope analysis. It was found that the degree of stabilization of thermal treated fibers in chemical evolution increased with the increase in TOS temperature and time. The increase in the extent of cyclization promoted the formation of conjugated carbonyls, whereas it decreased the crystallinity and crystallite size. Under the action of diffusion process, oxidation reaction caused the fracture morphology of radial structure transformed from ductility to brittleness. The extent of cyclization of fibers controlled in an appropriate range resulted in the high degree of oxidation stabilization and good structural properties, not the higher, the better. This result was evidenced by the excessive oxidative and cross-linking reaction in the skin of fibers resulted in the phenomenon that more obvious skin-core structure and reduced elongation at break when the cyclization degree was more than 83%.									17	1	0	0	0	0	18			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000475764300026

Herein novel type-II van der Waals (vdW) GaSe/CN and Ga2SSe/CN heterostructures are proposed through first-principles calculations. Their electronic properties and photocatalytic performance are theoretically analyzed. In particular, their appropriate band gap and band-edge position meet the requirements of the oxygen evolution reaction, and the reaction is thermodynamically feasible in most pH ranges. The unique band alignment of these heterostructured photocatalysts leads to high solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiencies up to 15.11%, which has a good commercial application prospect. More excitingly, with the application of 2% biaxial strain, the smooth progress of the water-splitting reaction of the GaSe/CN and Ga2SSe/CN heterostructures can still be maintained, and the carrier mobility and optical absorption characteristics can be effectively improved. Consequently, these findings suggest that the GaSe/CN and Ga2SSe/CN vdW heterostructures have promising potentials as photocatalysts for water splitting. This work may provide a promising clue for the design of efficient and stable photocatalytic water-splitting catalysts under visible spectroscopy.									44	1	0	0	0	0	44			1948-7185			WOS:000661113400004	34028280

Nevertheless, for transition metal phosphate based electrocatalyst, the further improvement of the electrocatalytic performance and the deep exploration of the regulation and control mechanism are still bottleneck problems. At present, we use a novel method to prepare the Ti foil supported the CoP acacia-like arrays decorated with RuP4 nanoparticles composite (RuP4@CoP/Ti). The obtained RuP4@CoP/Ti possesses excellent electrocatalytic performance, which needs the overpotential of 66.2 mV to reach the current of density of 10 mA cm(-2) and has the Tafel slope of 52.6 mV dec(-1) in 0.5 M H2SO4. In addition, it requires the overpotential of 36 mV to reach the current of density of 10 mA cm(-2) and has Tafel slope of 54.8 mV dec(-1) in 1 M KOH. Moreover, the obtained RuP4@CoP/Ti also presents outstanding long-term durability under either acidic or alkaline condition. The reason for such excellent properties is due to the unique acacia-like structure, the synergistic effect between CoP and RuP4, the existence of Ti foil and the introduction of Ru, which can optimize the electronic structure of Co and P.									11	0	0	0	1	0	11			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000582367700058

However, the low electronic conductivity and limited number of active catalytic sites of monolayer MoS2 limit the hydrogen production efficiency. In this work, the effect of phosphorus doping on the electronic characteristics and catalytic activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction in monolayer MoS2 was studied using density functional theory. A semiconductor to conductor transformation occurs in monolayer MoS2(1-x)Px for x larger than 0.25. The Gibbs free energy is greatly reduced from 2.18 to 0.03 eV for the adsorption of hydrogen on monolayer MoS0.5P0.75. The Gibbs free energy for hydrogen atom adsorption on monolayer MoS0.5P0.75 is between 0.03 and 0.16 eV with hydrogen coverage theta(H) = 1/12-7/12 ML. The Gibbs free energy is close to zero, indicating that phosphorus doping can trigger the basal plane active sites on monolayer MoS2; thus, this work provides a new design for the improvement of the catalytic activity of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide-based catalysts by phosphorus doping.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000447832700001

The microstructure of the alloys was examined by scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron probe microanalysis; XRD measurements were also performed. The electrochemical efficiency of the electrodes has been studied on the basis of electrochemical data obtained from steady-state polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques in 1 M NaOH solution at 298 K. The results were compared with those obtained on a binary Fe-Mo commercial alloy (Fe80Mo20, atomic %). Moreover, literature data concerning the electrocatalytic activity of the Ni75Mo25 and Co75Mo25 crystalline alloys, which are considered good electrocatalyst materials for the HER, were also reported for comparison. The microstructural features play a fundamental role in determining the electrocatalytic activity of the investigated alloys. The overall experimental data indicate that interesting electrocatalytic performances are displayed by the Fe75Mo20MM5 electrode, which exhibits the highest activity towards the HER.

The discovery of a non-enzymatic metabolism and its role in the origins of life								BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL				475				2577	2592		10.1042/BCJ20160866				AUG 31 2018	2018	Until recently, prebiotic precursors to metabolic pathways were not known. In parallel, chemistry achieved the synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides only in reaction sequences that do not resemble metabolic pathways, and by using condition step changes, incompatible with enzyme evolution. As a consequence, it was frequently assumed that the topological organisation of the metabolic pathway has formed in a Darwinian process. The situation changed with the discovery of a non-enzymatic glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. The suite of metabolism-like reactions is promoted by a metal cation, (Fe(II)), abundant in Archean sediment, and requires no condition step changes. Knowledge about metabolism-like reaction topologies has accumulated since, and supports non-enzymatic origins of gluconeogenesis, the S-adenosylmethionine pathway, the Krebs cycle, as well as CO2 fixation. It now feels that it is only a question of time until essential parts of metabolism can be replicated non-enzymatically. Here, I review the 'accidents' that led to the discovery of the non-enzymatic glycolysis, and on the example of a chemical network based on hydrogen cyanide, I provide reasoning why metabolism-like non-enzymatic reaction topologies may have been missed for a long time. Finally, I discuss that, on the basis of non-enzymatic metabolism-like networks, one can elaborate stepwise scenarios for the origin of metabolic pathways, a situation that increasingly renders the origins of metabolism a tangible problem.									41	0	0	0	31	0	42			0264-6021	1470-8728		WOS:000443175400001	30166494

Intense research efforts dedicated to oxynitride materials have unveiled the majority of their most important properties. However, two crucial aspects have received much less attention: One is the critical issue of compositional/structural surface modifications that occur during operation and how these affect photoelectrochemical performance. The second concerns the relation between electrochemical response and the crystallographic surface orientation of the oxynitride semiconductor. These are indeed topics of fundamental importance, since it is exactly at the surface where the visible-light-driven electrochemical reaction takes place. In contrast to conventional powder samples, thin films represent the best model system for these investigations. This study reviews current state-of-the-art oxynitride thin film fabrication and characterization, before focusing on LaTiO2N, selected as a representative photocatalyst. An investigation of the initial physicochemical evolution of the surface is reported. Then, it is shown that after stabilization the absorbed photon-to-current conversion efficiency of epitaxial thin films can differ by about 50% for different crystallographic surface orientations, and be up to 5 times larger than for polycrystalline samples.									29	0	0	0	2	0	29			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000401803400002

However, a general low-temperature protocol that describes deposition of varieties of MS structures, especially in their film form is still not available in literatures. Here, a simple and highly effective general solution-based deposition protocol for highly crystalline and well-defined nanostructured MS thin films from ethanol on variety of conducting and non-conducting substrates is presented. The films display remarkable electronic properties such as high carrier mobility and high conductivity. When NiS thin film deposited on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate is used as a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)-free counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells, it exhibits a solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency of 9.27 +/- 0.26% with the highest conversion efficiency as high as 9.50% (vs 8.97 +/- 0.07% exhibited by Pt-electrode). In addition, the NiS film deposited on a Ti-foil has demonstrated an outstanding catalytic activity for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions from water.									53	0	0	0	6	0	53			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000362517900002

The films were evaporated by e-gun with an oxygen partial pressure during the deposition process. The refractive index is governed by the total content and distribution of Ti in the film. The source composition evolves with the number of depositions, possibly because of titanium oxide decomposition produced by the electrons. As a consequence, these changes are reflected in the composition of the film. A comparison between two forms of the oxide mixture source, 'small grains' and 'pellet', indicates better reproducibility for the latter.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0026-2692			WOS:A1994PW32900022

This paper reports on the original and strong effects observed in the electrochemical response of these two-phase systems towards oxygen reduction by varying the Pt amount in the mixed LB films. The easy manipulation of pre-synthesized organically capped nanoparticles, combined with the features of the Langmuir-Blodgett technique allows good control of the platinum loading in the films. Pt loadings are set by changing the number of deposited monolayers and/or their nanoparticle density. Loading variations induce strong modifications in the voltammograms and are considered in terms of the relative weight of the two phases: platinum nanoparticles and fatty acids. We point out the strong influence of the environment of platinum nanoparticles towards their electrocatalytical behaviour. Various effects, such as electrical resistance of the nanostructures are considered. Evolution of the peak current density ratios from O-2 and [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) probes as a function of platinum loading in mixed films could suggest a possible change in the dominating number of electrons exchanged in the ORR. The effect of the fatty acid phase is definitely demonstrated by the leveling of the electrochemical responses after its elimination from the thin film structures. The electrochemical response is then likely governed by only the organic crown of the particles, which controls the ultimate local environment of the platinum particles. In such a situation, the optimized platinum loading is found to be 2.4 mu gcm(-2). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			0013-4686	1873-3859		WOS:000257011400018

Herein, a novel structure of ultra-thin carbon bridged MoC quantum dots/g-C3N4 nanosheets was constructed for the first time to facilitate carrier transfer and accelerate surface reactions. In our designed composites, a surface-to-surface contact has been formed between conductive carbon layer and g-C3N4 nanosheet via ultrasonic assembly process. Moreover, there exist strong interfaces between MoC QDs and carbon layer because of the in-situ conversion method. As to this unique structure, the ultra-thin carbon layer functions as charge separation and migration high ways while the MoC QDs perform as noble-metal-free co-catalysts consuming the surface electrons promptly. Significantly, an optimal 40 wt% MoC QDs-C/g-C3N4 photocatalyst (MCCN) is synthesized with a hydrogen evolution rate of 2989 mu mol h(-1) g(-1), which is 69.6 and 1.7 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4 and Pt/g-C3N4, respectively.

The charge transfer resistance is the main internal anodic resistance instead of the resistance due to discharge products. The anodic hydrogen reaction was the only reason for the anodic efficiency drop for the UHP Mg anode. A uni-positive Mg+ mechanism explained the anodic hydrogen reaction and two morphologies of discharge products. The UHP Mg had a strong preferred dissolution orientation during discharge at a low applied current density, which tended to disappear with increasing current density. The strongly oriented dissolution of Mg increased the apparent charge transfer resistance of the Mg anode.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000695504800001

The selective reactions were: alkylating and non-alkylating reduction according to Sternberg, performic acid oxidation, thermal decarboxylation of the oxidized vitrain, LiAlH4 reduction of the oxidized vitrain, and O-methylation of residual hydroxyl groups. The original vitrain and the products of the modification reactions were pyrolysed in a stream of helium at atmospheric pressure and the volatile compounds were continuously detected during thermal programming, using flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry. The compounds detected were: tar and light oils, CO2, CO, SO2, H2S, CH4, H-2 and N2. The results are in agreement with the expected changes in chemical structure. A number of coal structural features are revealed by detailed examination of the gas profiles. Oil and gas evolution correlate well with infrared spectroscopy and sequential solvent extraction of the modified samples. The higher oil yield and the lower yields of H-2 and N2 can be attributed to the suppression of the regressive effect of the oxygen groups and to the addition of hydrogen centres.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0016-2361			WOS:A1994NL28900018

The results show an excellent activity, 135 mA cm(geo)(-2) (by cyclic voltammetry) and stability (90-76.5 mA cm(geo)(-2)) over 30 min in alkaline media (NaOH 1 M + 0.25 M urea). The activity was extremely pH dependent, decreasing sharply at pH 12-13, but remaining higher than the OER at all pH investigated. The activity could be recovered by replacing the electrolyte by a fresh solution. The absence of correlation between the amount of NiOOH sites formed and the current measured at different pH suggests a limitation, either kinetic in the formation of NiOOH or in the amount of hydroxyl anions available, at pH < 14. Nevertheless, at pH approximate to 14, chronopotentiometry measurements revealed a gain of 120 mV in the potential needed to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm(geo)(-2). Meanwhile, the production of formate at a tin cathode remained constant or slightly increased in the presence of urea at the anode at all potentials tested.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			0021-891X	1572-8838		WOS:000678290000001		
J	Vavilin, DV; Ermakova-Gerdes, SY; Keilty, AT; Vermaas, WFJ								Tryptophan at position 181 of the D2 protein of photosystem II confers quenching of variable fluorescence of chlorophyll: Implications for the mechanism of energy-dependent quenching								BIOCHEMISTRY				38	44			14690	14696		10.1021/bi9915622				NOV 2 1999	1999	The lumenal CD loop region of the D2 protein of photosystem II contains residues that interact with a reaction center chlorophyll and the redox-active Tyro. Using combinatorial mutagenesis, photoautotrophic mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 have been generated with multiple amino acid changes in this region. The CD loop mutations were transferred into a photosystem I-less Synechocystis strain to facilitate characterization of photosystem II properties in the mutants. Most of the combinatorial photosystem I-less mutants obtained had a high yield of variable fluorescence, F-V. However, in three mutants, which shared a replacement of Phe181 by Trp, the F-V yield was dramatically reduced although a high rate of oxygen evolution was maintained. A site-directed F181W D2 mutant shared similar properties. Picosecond time-resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that in the combinatorial F181W mutants the fluorescence lifetimes in closed and open photosystem II centers were essentially identical and were similar to the fluorescence lifetime in open centers of the control strain. These results are explained by quenching of variable fluorescence in the mutants by charge separation between Trp181 and excited reaction center chlorophyll. This reaction competes efficiently with fluorescence and nonradiative decay in closed photosystem II centers, where the Lifetime of the excitation in the chlorophyll antenna is long. Thermodynamic considerations favor the formation of oxidized tryptophan and reduced chlorophyll in the quenching reaction, presumably followed by charge recombination. A possible role of tryptophan-chlorophyll charge separation in the mechanism of energy-dependent quenching of excitations in photosynthesis is discussed.									10	0	0	0	10	0	10			0006-2960			WOS:000083665200031	10545195

The model is distributed-charge and dynamic, and allows to predict polarization curves and impedance spectra of applicative sized planar cells (up to 10 cm x 10 cm) mounted between interconnects with rectangular ducts. The model solves rigorous conservation equations of mass, charge, momentum and energy, along the interconnect channels and within the cell's layers. The kinetic parameters of the hydrogen oxidation reaction and of the oxygen reduction reaction are fitted to a literature dataset measured between 700 degrees C and 800 degrees C, with a 20% H-2 , 5% H2O and 75% N-2 mixture, on a standard anode-supported HT-SOFC (Ni-YSZ/YSZ/GDC/LSCF). Once calibrated, the model is used to study the evolution of local impedance spectra along the channel, as well as the occurrence of gradients of temperature, concentration, and current density within and along the cell structure. Remarkable differences emer ge between global impedance spectra, based on the average current density extracted from the whole cell's surface, and local impedance spectra, based on the local current density value at each position along the channel. Local spectra reveal very specific features (negative-resistance arcs), which are absent in the average spectra, and which question the opportunity of collecting spatially resolved impedance measurements on a fine scale. The analysis of the steady state behavior highlights the severity of temperature gradients along the channel (150 K at 0.75 V and 50% H-2 utilization factor), the onset of current density peaks, and the crucial role of interphase mass transport at the gas/electrode interface. The consequences of external diffusion on the polarization performance are analyzed, and the impact of different channel configurations on the local evolution of the spectra is explored.

The NiAl-LDH@GO is used as the precursor to synthetize an N-doped carbon@Ni-Al2O3 nanosheet array@GO composite (N-C@Ni-Al2O3@GO) by coating with dopamine followed by calcination. The N-C@Ni-Al2O3@GO is used as a non-noble metal electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction in alkaline medium, and exhibits high electrocatalytic activity with low onset overpotential (-75 mV). The improved electrocatalytic performance of N-C@Ni-Al2O3@GO arises from its intrinsic features. First, it has a high specific surface area with the Ni nanoparticles in the composite dispersed well and the sizes of Ni nanoparticles are small, which lead to the exposure of more active sites for electrocatalysis. Second, there is a synergistic effect between the Ni nanoparticles and the N-C coating layer, which is beneficial to reduce the activation energy of the Volmer step and improve the electrocatalytic activity. Third, the N-C coating layer and the XC-72 additive can form an electrically conductive network, which serves as a bridge for the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the Ni nanoparticles.

This present work explores the fabrication of nickel-nitrogen doped CNT through a simplistic approach. The as-fabricated Ni-NCNT8.0 showcases a robust HER performance amongst the other catalysts (Ni-NCNT7.5, Ni-NCNT8.5, Ni-x, and Glu-x) with a small overpotential of 147 mV and Tafel slope of 57.6 mV dec-1 to approach a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in alkaline medium. It also exhibits an excellent stability for 20 h. The high HER performance originates from the abundant and well-formed N-doped CNT that serves as conductive support and the synergy between the nickel nanoparticles which suffice as the catalyst active sites and the N-doped CNT. Additionally, the optimized electronic structure of the nickel nitrogen-doped CNT provided by density functional theory calculations, revealed a low HOMO-LUMO energy gap and high ionization potential that enhanced the stability of the electrocatalyst and conveys an effective HER.									10	0	0	0	1	0	10			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000663741300004

In this work, the mechanism of surfactant-mediated morphology evolution and self-assembly of CeO2 nanocrystals is elucidated by exploring the effect that surfactant modification has on the shape, size, exposed facets, and arrangement of the CeO2 NCs. It is directly proved that surfactant molecules determine the morphologies of the CeO2 NCs by preferentially bonding onto Ce-terminated {100} facets, changing from large truncated octahedra (mostly {111} and {100} exposed), to cubes (mostly {100} exposed) and small cuboctahedra (mostly {100} and {111} exposed) by increasing the amount of surfactant. The exposure degree of the {100} facets largely affects the concentration of Ce3+ in the CeO2 NCs, thus the cubic CeO2 NCs exhibit superior oxygen storage capacity and excellent supercapacitor performance due to a high fraction of exposed active {100} facets with great superstructure stability.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000656896200001	34076010

Empirical analysis of limit of desulphurization of iron ore based on multi-factorial process variables								Usak University Journal of Material Sciences				2	2			169	86						Dec. 2013	2013	Desulphurization of iron ore was carried out using an oxidant; powdered potassium chlorate (KClO3) of mass-input range (5-12g) and temperature range (500-800degC). The limit of desulphurization was evaluated considering the initial ore sulphur content and removed sulphur concentration. Investigation on the process analysis and mechanism of the desulphurization process revealed that oxygen gas from the decomposition of KClO3 interacted with sulphur through molecular combination within the Gas Evolution Temperature Range (GETR); 375-502degC. Sulphur transformation into vapour within this temperature range was observed to facilitate easy reaction with oxygen gas to form SO2, A limit of desulphurization; 92.22% was experimentally achieved following successful reduction of the initial ore sulphur content to 0.007 % using 12g of KClO3 at a treatment temperature of 800degC. A model was derived and used as a tool for empirical analysis of limit of desulphurization based on treatment temperature, mass-input of KClO3, sulphur loss-sulphur initial ratio. Deviational analysis indicates that the derived model gives best-fit process analysis with a deviation range of just 0.65-8.82%, from experimental results and invariably an operational confidence level range 91.18-99.35%. The deviation range corresponds to limit of desulphurization range: 31.4019-86.6128%, treatment temperature range: 600-800degC, KClO3 mass-input range: 7-12g and range of sulphur loss-sulphur initial ratio: 0.3444-0.5556. Hence, the derived model can exclusive, be significantly and viably operational within these process conditions.									0	0	0		0	0	0			2147-2785			INSPEC:14131691

The understanding and prediction of the interesting properties of such materials are dependent on the knowledge of detailed atomic structures. In this work, amorphous silica subjected to an accelerated alkali silica reaction (ASR) was recorded at different time intervals so as to follow the evolution of the structure by means of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and electron pair distribution function (e-PDF), combined with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). An increase in the size of the amorphous silica nanostructures and nanopores was observed by HRTEM, which was accompanied by the possible formation of Si-OH surface species. All of the studied samples were found to be amorphous, as observed by HRTEM, a fact that was also confirmed by XRPD and e-PDF analysis. A broad diffuse peak observed in the XRPD pattern showed a shift toward higher angles following the higher reaction times of the ASR-treated material. A comparison of the EELS spectra revealed varying spectral features in the peak edges with different reaction times due to the interaction evolution between oxygen and the silicon and OH ions. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was also used to elucidate the silica nanostructures.									12	0	0	0	1	0	12				1996-1944		WOS:000586727100001	33019776

In this work, densely packed NiO@Ru nanosheets were fabricated on the surface of Ni foam through a two-step method of Ni(OH)(2) growth followed by Ru deposition. Through pair distribution function analysis from selected-area electron diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the interface structure feature is revealed as a thin layer of perovskite NiRuO3 sandwiched between NiO and Ru. The electrode exhibits high activity and durability for HER and OER, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.55 V for overall water splitting in 1 M KOH. The excellent performance can be attributed to the intimate interface contact of NiO and Ru in addition to low charge transfer resistance and super-hydrophilic surface structure, as verified by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and contact-angle measurement.									3	1	0	0	0	0	3			1439-4235	1439-7641		WOS:000673128900001	34153153

These two compounds can be explored as stable electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) using two important parameters: the overpotential and Tafel slope (TS). Electrochemical studies suggest that the reaction kinetics of a Co-1 catalyst is more favorable than that of a Ni-2 catalyst. Co-1 exhibits better HER performance with an overpotential of 182 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a small TS of 87.21 mV dec(-1) and superior long-term durability (of up to 3000 cycles). Structural analysis shows that its catalytic activity is improved due to the two mixed valence cobalt ions and the pore structure formed by hydrogen bonds in Co-1, which is different from that of Ni-2. In addition, the mechanism of the HER is also explained theoretically by DFT molecular orbital and free energy calculations in this article.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000755875500001	35171175

The high electric conductivity of N-MMC and an abundance of exposed edges on the MoS2 nanosheets make the hybrid excellent electrocatalytic performance with a low onset potential of 98 mV, a small Tafel slope of 52 mV/decade, and a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at the overpotential of 150 mV.

Here, we have studied the adsorption and electronic properties as well as the catalytic activities of group 9-11 single metal atoms deposited on NbC(001), denoted M/NbC(001). According to the location of the d-band centers and the frontier molecular orbital analysis, single metals of Co, Rh, Ir and Ni on NbC(001) exhibit higher activities than other metals (Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au). The quite different catalytic activities of M/NbC(001) may be attributed to the differences in their electro-negativities and work-functions. Meanwhile, the reasonable stabilities of Co, Rh, Ir and Ni on NbC(001) were clarified by investigating the agglomeration resistance and oxidation resistance, and the results indicate that Co and Ni have poor oxidative stability, and Rh and Ir are antioxidants on NbC(001). Further research into the adsorption and activation of O-2 confirmed the outstanding properties of Rh/NbC(001) and Ir/NbC(001), which may provide great opportunities to find alternative catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000430537600064	29610801

In order to understand the roots of their high selectivity and low activity and to direct the design of more active NixPy-based CO2RR catalysts, we investigate the CO2RR mechanism on Ni2P using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We reveal that the reaction proceeds through the formate pathway, followed by formaldehyde (H2CO*) formation and self-condensation. Moreover, we demonstrate that surface hydride transfer steps, along with surface-mediated C-C coupling, are essential in order to avoid C-1 product formation and boost selectivity toward multicarbon products. In addition, we find that the thermal surface hydride transfer from the surface to the physisorbed CO2 is one of the key rate-limiting steps, and since it is not electroactive, it cannot be accelerated by applying an overpotential. Finally, our results also show that the hydrogen affinity of the surface and the dynamic surface reconstruction via H adsorption facilitate selective CO2 reduction and C-C coupling on Ni2P. These findings provide an impetus for exploring materials design space to identify the physical principles that govern the thermodynamics of rate-limiting thermal steps in electrocatalytic processes.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			2155-5435			WOS:000697346200038

Based on the EIS data, an equivalent circuit was suggested. In addition, the electrochemical parameters for specific anodic dissolution regions were carefully measured. An induction loop in Nyquist plot measured at the open-circuit potential was observed in the low frequency, and this could be attributed to the adsorption-desorption behavior in the corrosion process.				변전위법과 전기화학적 임피던스측정법(electrochemical impedence spectroscopy)을 이용하여 borate 완충용액에서 Co- RDE의 전기화학적 부식과 부동화에 대하여 조사하였다.

The structures of the electro-catalysts at different scales were explored through laboratory instrumentation, powder X-ray diffraction, and synchrotron-based X-ray total scattering experiments combined with pair distribution function analysis. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy using a transmission electron microscope were used to determine respectively the surface and the bulk elemental compositions of the samples. The coherent domain size (CDS) values of IrOx phases within the catalyst particles were estimated to be similar to 10, similar to 19, and similar to 54 angstrom for the three IrOx samples. Surprisingly, the sample with a CDS of similar to 19 angstrom turned out as the best OER electrocatalyst among the three in terms of mass-specific activity, I-O(ER)(m), followed by the 10 and 54 angstrom species. The amount of surface native compound oxygen was found to be a key parameter for the interface electrochemical accessibility. The intrinsic OER activity, evaluated using area-specific activity, I-O(ER)(a), suggests that the oxide with lattice disorder presenting a mixture of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases (70:20 w/w) is of superior intrinsic OER activity; however, the oxide with the presence of a monoclinic-like phase is of inferior intrinsic OER activity, which may also be due to the surface presence of Ir3+ along with Ir4+. The classic belief that the pure tetragonal phase is the best crystalline structure as the OER catalyst is challenged. Iridium oxides with disordered crystallinities may offer a class of highly active oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. The knowledge thus obtained should have a significant impact on the understanding, selection, and processing of IrOx-based OER electrocatalysts.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			2574-0962			WOS:000636714000057

Cadmium exposure significantly inhibited root elongation and induced loss of plasma membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation of roots tips in the NHE, whereas these effects were much less pronounced in the HE plants. A strong accumulation of reactive oxygen species with increasing Cd concentration was noted in the NHE root tips, but not in HE. After Cd exposure, a dose-dependent decrease in oxidized glutathione and marked increase in reduced glutathione and non-protein thiols were observed in root tips of HE, but were not seen in the NHE plants. These results suggest that the HE tolerates high Cd in the environment through the differential adaptations against Cd-induced oxidative stress.									40	3	0	0	38	0	43			0006-3134	1573-8264		WOS:000301179100020

In this work, a controllable Prussian-blue-analogue-sacrificed strategy followed by an annealing process to harvest defect-rich Ni-Fe-doped K0.23MnO2 cubic nanoflowers (Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300) as highly active bifunctional catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER) is reported. Benefiting from many merits, including unique morphology, abundant defects, and doping effect, Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300 shows the best electrocatalytic performances among currently reported Mn oxide-based electrocatalysts. This catalyst affords low overpotentials of 270 (320) mV at 10 (100) mA cm(-2) for OER with a small Tafel slope of 42.3 mV dec(-1), while requiring overpotentials of 116 and 243 mV to attain 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) for HER respectively. Moreover, Ni-Fe-K0.23MnO2 CNFs-300 applied to overall water splitting exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.62 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and excellent durability, even superior to the Pt/C||IrO2 cell at large current density. Density functional theory calculations further confirm that doping Ni and Fe into the crystal lattice of delta-MnO2 can not only reinforce the conductivity but also reduces the adsorption free-energy barriers on the active sites during OER and HER.									32	1	0	0	3	0	32			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000512814700001	32049431

Herein, the atypical role of graphene oxide (GO) in the morphology of 2D Co-based leaf-like zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-Co-L) is reported. We demonstrated that GO regulated water accessibility in the ZIF reaction medium. The shape of GOmodified ZIF transformed from typical leaf-like (at GO contents of less than 40 wt%) to elongated hexagonalshape (at GO contents of >= 40 wt%). This was attributed to the trapping of water molecules into the interlayers of GO. The water-deficient medium restricted crystal growth along the a direction of ZIF-Co-L and caused the formation of hexagonal shapes by distorting the water-driven hydrogen-bonding interactions between monodentate methylimidazole (mIm) in the ab direction and free mIm in the c direction. Furthermore, the leaflike ZIF-Co-L@10%GO and hexagonal-shaped ZIF-Co-L@40%GO precursors were carbonized to Co-embedded Ndoped-carbon/reduced GO (rGO) electrocatalysts, denoted as Co-NC@10rGO-leaf and Co-NC@40rGO-Hex, respectively. The Co-NC@10rGO-leaf catalyst (-3% rGO) presented fast kinetics and high durability (-10 h) in KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the overpotential of Co-NC@10rGO-leaf at 10 mA cm-2 in the KOH electrolyte (220 mV) was lower than that of Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (230 mV). This was ascribed to the lower ratio of Co-torGO contents in the Co-NC@40rGO-Hex. (-13% rGO) inhibiting its HER activity despite their excellent shape benefits of the ZIF precursor. The superior performance of Co-NC@rGO electrocatalysts was attributed to the unique shape features of ZIF precursor; abundant active sites; and synergistic effect of Co nanoparticles, N doping, and conducting carbon. The proposed synthesis approach offers promising prospects for the development of transition-metal-supported carbon-based catalysts from shape-variant MOF precursors for efficient electrochemical water splitting.									8	0	0	0	1	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000723848600003

Herein, we report a series of FeP nanorod arrays (FeP NRAs) with polypyrrole (PPy) shell coating on carbon textiles (CTs) to improve the HER performance. The composite combines the high conductivity of PPy and synergistic effect between FeP and PPy, where the PPy coating remarkably reduces the apparent activation energy for HER and increases the turnover frequency of catalysts, thus the electrocatalytic performance of FeP@PPy/CTs hybrid nanorod arrays is significantly improved. Among them, the FeP@PPy/CTs-5 h catalyst exhibit superior HER performance with a low onset over-potential of 103.1 mV and a small Tafel slope of 49.2 mV/dec at 10 mA cm(-2), and as well as an excellent long-term stability during operation for 46 h. Notably, it shows efficient HER performance during various bending status, demonstrating that the stability and flexibility of FeP@PPy/CTs catalysts. The excellent electrocatalytic performance is promising for applications as a costeffective non-noble-metal HER catalyst during electrochemical water splitting for large-scale hydrogen fuel production.									4	1	0	0	0	0	5			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000773068800002

Here, we first report three-dimensional nanostructure of MnNb2O6 as electrode materials for electrochemical pseudocapacitor synthesized through hydrothermal method. The crystal morphologies of MnNb2O6 show an evolution with the hydrothermal time, from primary spindle-like particles grown for 12 h and undergrown star-like crystals for 18 h, to hierarchical star-like crystals for 1 day and overgrown crystals for 3 days. MNO-1d sample synthesized for 1 day possesses ordered six-leaf nanostructure composed of hierarchical nano-sheets (thickness-30 nm). To explore its potential applications for supercapacitor, MnNb2O6 sample as electrode material is characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. MNO-1d demonstrates an outstanding specific capacitance of 350 F g(-1) and rate capability with a high capacitance retention of-90% of its initial capacitance after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g(-1).

From applications that require a high energy density to long-term storage in a stable manner, the requirements for energy usage are diverse. Therefore, the greater the number of uses a designed material exhibits, the more practical it may be for wide-scale manufacture. Two areas of particular interest for energy applications are fuel cells (to generate energy) and supercapacitors (to store energy). To provide cheaper and more durable alternatives for energy storage, electrodes containing CoMoO4, NiMoO4, CoMoS4, and NiMoS4 were synthesized. The electrodes were synthesized through a hydrothermal method using Ni-foam as the substrate then tested as electrocatalysts for water splitting and electrodes for supercapacitor. As an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction, NiMoS4 displayed the lowest overpotential of 148 mV with a Tafel slope of 159 mV/dec. On the other hand, CoMoS4 showed the lowest overpotential of 189 mV with a Tafel slope of 78 mV/dec among all four samples for oxygen evolution reactions. In terms of energy storage, the CoMoO4 had the highest specific capacitance of 2652 F/g at a current density of 0.5 A/g with an averaged charge retention of 91% and a Coulombic efficiency of 99% after 10,000 cycles.									6	0	0	0	0	0	6			0257-8972	1879-3347		WOS:000681716300013

Here, we present a simple one-step electrodeposition for the synthesis of ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) decorated cobalt monophosphide (CoPx) nanoflowers formed on titanium nitride (TiN) nanoarrays. Accompanied with the TiN nanoarrays as a support, the synthesized Fe3O4-CoPx/TiN exhibits an excellent activity with an onset potential of SO mV as well as superior stability even after 100 h for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Besides, the Fe3O4-CoPx/TiN composite delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low overpotential of 331 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which outperforms the Ir-based noble-metal catalyst synergetic effects among each component and the reinforced structural stability. Specifically, the incorporation of Fe3O4 into phosphide promotes the electron donor-acceptor properties during the catalytic progress that leads to a significant activity enhancement. Simultaneously, the TiN nanoarrays not only offer multi-charge-transfer channels to facilitate the electronic procedure, but also help to anchor and uniform the Fe3O4-CoPx nanoflowers without aggregation, further enabling a dynamic stability of the composite. Therefore, this work highlights the favorable integration of Fe3O4, CoPx, and TiN, which provides a way for constructing the hybrid structure for high-performance water splitting.									17	2	0	0	0	0	17			2574-0970			WOS:000464491500006

Here, the synthesis of a novel oxidic ternary cocatalyst containing molybdenum, chromium, and copper, which has been found to be highly active in the overall photocatalytic splitting of water over gallium oxide, is described. With the noble metal-free system, requiring hydrogen evolution rates comparable to that of the well-established RhxCr2-xO3/Ga2O3 water splitting cocatalyst is achieved. Although the stability of the as-prepared ternary cocatalyst system appeared to be poor, the cocatalyst can be easily regenerated and stabilized by an oxygen treatment under ambient conditions. Furthermore, higher MoOx loadings were found to be more active and showed improved stability. By means of careful characterization using Xray-based spectroscopy and TEM, the function of the individual cocatalyst compounds was closely examined, suggesting synergetic interactions of molybdena and chromia stabilizing CuO against photoreduction. Although stability issues should be further addressed, this work highlights that multicomponent systems, which are well-studied in industrial processes for heterogeneous reactions and commonly used in various other fields of research, can be used in solar water splitting. In particular, molybdena-containing materials are discovered as a new class of earth-abundant cocatalysts for overall water-splitting.									34	2	0	0	0	0	34			2155-5435			WOS:000361089700063

In this study, nitrogendecorated single-walled carbon nanotubes (N-SWCNT) were fabricated using urea as a green precursor under thermal pyrolysis. We comprehensively investigated the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation at varying temperatures with/without the nanocarbon toward nitrobenzene (NB) oxidation. In the noncatalytic system, NB decomposition rate was impressively boosted with the raising reaction temperatures. More importantly, hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH) were unveiled to be the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contributed to NB degradation under high temperatures in PMS/N-SWCNT system. The mechanism of PMS activation with/without N-SWCNT and impact of temperature were elucidated by both in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique and selectively radical quenching tests. Interestingly, the NB degradation kinetics witnessed a two-stage process with different activation energies in PMS only and PMS/N-SWCNT systems, suggesting that the reaction temperaturemay be able to tune the catalytic mechanism and generated ROS. Therefore, the nanocarbon-catalyzed and thermal-assisted metal-free AOPs can be featured with maneuverable oxidative potentials toward a wide range of redox processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

With adjustable structural characteristics and maximum atomic utilization efficiency, single-atomic site catalysts (SACs) are considered to be the most potential next-generation materials. Moreover, the introduction and coupling of some synergistic components is desirable to accurately regulate the structural interactions and lead to improved activity. In addition to the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in SACs, there is tremendous opportunity to explore and develop the synergistic effect of SAC-nanoparticles (SAC-NPs), SAC-clusters (SACCs), dual-atom site catalysts (DACs), and single-atomic alloys (SAAs). Moreover, these unique synergistic structures between adjacent atomic sites could still maintain their high atomically dispersed nature and stability. In this review, we begin by introducing the types, synthetic strategies and characterization methods of SAC-NPs, SACCs, DACs and SAAs, discussing the key factors controlling their structures. We then review several important clean energy catalytic reactions performed over these atomic-coupling structures, and compare the respective advantages and disadvantages of SACs, SAC-NPs, SACCs, DACs and SAAs. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of this unique single-atomic site synergistic effect are suggested. We believe that this critical review provides guidance for the rational design of new single-atomic site catalysts for clean energy conversion.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000727445700001

In this work, a novel material of Mo-doped NiFe(x )nanospheres on 3D graphene fibers (Mo-NiFex/ 3DGFs) has been successfully fabricated through a simple and cheap one-step electrode-position method. The Mo-NiFex/3DGFs possessed ultra-high conductivity and specific surface area, greatly benefiting to electrocatalytic hydrolysis activity. And it was found that Fe element could obviously promote OER process, while Mo doping facilitated both OER and HER reactions. We proved that there existed synergetic roles between Fe and Mo element, which could realize the control of the electronic structure and optimize the adsorption/ desorption of intermediates. And electrochemical tests showed that the Mo-Ni/3DGFs exhibited a relatively smaller overpotential of 109.9 mV for HER, while the Mo-NiFex/3DGFs presented better OER performance with an overpotential of 240.8 mV at the current density of 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH. Finally, a system for overall water splitting constructed by Mo-Ni/3DGFs||Mo-NiFe0.68/3DGFs electrodes has a low cell voltage of 1.52 V at 10 mA cm(-2) and long-term stability, exceeding most of literature results. Our findings provide insight into possibilities for the simple synthesis of high-performance and cheap catalysts, and laid the foundation for the practical application of transition metal catalysts.(c) 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Graphene is obtained by electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in cathode, while carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are in-situ generated in the electrolyte simultaneously. CQDs are evolved from propylene carbonate solvent and Pt NPs are derived from reduction of Pt intermediate species generated from anodic dissolution of Pt counter electrode during electrolysis process. Then Pt NPs and CQDs are well dispersed on graphene at subsequent solvothermal process. Work voltage and electrolyte type as the key electrolysis conditions are applied to control the concentration of CQDs and Pt NPs, which decides electrochemically active surface area and HER activity of obtained catalysts. Significantly, the obtained superior catalyst with trace amount of Pt (0.145 wt%), shows markedly enhanced catalytic HER activity with mass activity of 37.5 A mg(-1)d at -50 mV in acidic solution, 68.2 times more active than Pt/C. This study provides a universal and promising methodology for synthesizing Pt, CQDs coloaded hybrid with the assistance of electric field as cost-effective catalysts for fuel cells.									18	0	0	0	1	0	18			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000518874300075

Accordingly, in this study, synthesis and functionalization of graphene oxide via a modified Tour's method (GOT) with different amine containing molecules results in excellent catalytic performance and stability toward OER in alkaline medium. The as-synthesized polyethyleneimine GOT electrode (P-GOT), produced current densities of 10, 50 and 100 mA/cm(2) at overpotentials of 240, 350 and 420 mV, respectively, with small Tafel slope of 47 mV/dec. The X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirms the successful functionalization of GOT by ethylenediamine (E) and polyethyleneimine (P) molecules, respectively. Morphological studies based on field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) confirm that the modification via covalent bonding preserved the original wrinkled and layered structure of GOT. The P-GOT with cross-linked amine can expose more active sites and is not easy to peel off, which corresponds to attaining lower charge transfer resistance (1.01 Omega cm(2)) and remarkable current stability in 1.0 M KOH solution, compared to the pristine GOT and E-GOT electrodes. From this perspective, our results therefore provide a valuable route for development and practical application of metal free catalytic materials for water oxidation reaction.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			2468-8231			WOS:000714752900001

The electronic structure of 1 was elucidated using the OFT approach. Complex 1 is readily prepared by a one-pot procedure in aqueous solution and catalyzes the reduction of water using visible light irradiation (lambda = 455 nm) with [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a photosensitizer and sacrificial electron donor, respectively. Upon irradiation, the excited state [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)* is oxidatively quenched by 1, as confirmed by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence decay studies, to form [Ru(bpy)(3)](3+) and a reduced form of the catalyst. The [Ru(bpy)(3)](2+) is rapidly regenerated by reaction with TEOA. The reduced form of the catalyst, 1, reacts with water to generate hydrogen. Isotope labeling experiments demonstrate that the hydrogen comes from water. The stability of the catalyst was assessed using different spectroscopic methods. A mechanism based on experimental results is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									89	4	0	0	3	0	90			0021-9517	1090-2694		WOS:000327903900005

Earth's first ecosystems were chemotrophic, fueled by geological H-2 at hydrothermal vents and, required flavin-based electron bifurcation to reduce ferredoxin for CO2 fixation. Chlorophyll-based phototrophy (chlorophototrophy) allowed autotrophs to generate reduced ferredoxin without electron bifurcation, providing them access to reductants other than H-2. Because high-intensity, short-wavelength electromagnetic radiation at Earth's surface would have been damaging for the first chlorophyll (Chl)-containing cells, photosynthesis probably arose at hydrothermal vents under low-intensity, long-wavelength geothermal light. The first photochemically active pigments were possibly Zn-tetrapyrroles. We suggest that (i) after the evolution of red-absorbing Chl-like pigments, the first light-driven electron transport chains reduced ferredoxin via a type-1 reaction center (RC) progenitor with electrons from H2S; (ii) photothioautotrophy, first with one RC and then with two, was the bridge between H-2-dependent chemolithoautotrophy and water-splitting photosynthesis; (iii) photothiotrophy sustained primary production in the photic zone of Archean oceans; (iv) photosynthesis arose in an anoxygenic cyanobacterial progenitor; (v) Chl a is the ancestral Chl; and (vi), anoxygenic chlorophototrophic lineages characterized so far acquired, by horizontal gene transfer, RCs and Chl biosynthesis with or without autotrophy, from-the architects of chlorophototrophy-the cyanobacterial lineage.									67	1	0	0	50	0	69			0168-6445	1574-6976		WOS:000427536400007	29177446

Alteration of these catalyst layer designs to reduce loadings and increase efficiency requires knowledge of the different resistances associated with both the hydrogen-based electrode and the oxygen-based electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) allows investigation of these different resistances (charge transport, kinetics, mass transport) based on their time scale during operation; however, this approach requires physical models and equivalent circuits to accurately interpret the EIS spectra. Further, little to no insight into the EIS spectra for hydrogen-based electrodes in MEAs is observed due to the domination of the slow oxygen-based electrode kinetics. Knowledge of the structure and performance of hydrogen-based electrodes is important for the integration of novel catalysts or catalyst layer designs for future MEA development. Here, we investigate the performance of Pt/C-Nafion catalyst layers toward hydrogen evolution and oxidation in a "proton-pump" design using EIS and distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis under low hydrogen concentrations. The combination of EIS and DRT analysis allows the identification of processes impacting the impedance without the use of equivalent circuit models, while the low hydrogen concentration increases the prominence of the diffusion-based resistances. These analyses are then used to develop a general equivalent circuit model based on the physicochemical processes occurring during MEA operation, allowing the exchange currents, ionic conductivity, and diffusion coefficients of the catalyst layers to be monitored as a function of humidity, current, and Nafion content. The methods and techniques presented here provide a comprehensive approach for analyzing novel catalyst layer designs in MEAs, as well as monitoring degradation pathways during operation.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447	1932-7455		WOS:000740014300001

However, it suffers inevitable aggregation during the fabrication process resulting in the low hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. Herein, vanadium carbide nanodots with 7.5 nm in size anchored on N doped carbon nanosheets (VC/NC) are synthesized by magnesiothermic reduction (MTR) using hybrid vanadium pentoxide (V2O5)/polyaniline composite as the precursor. During MTR, the V2O5 species in situ convert into VC nanodots, and the polyaniline layers translate into NC nanosheets. Owing to the highly conductive and stable NC nanosheets and abundance of active sites on VC nanodots, the VC/NC delivers a small overpotential of 76 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with Tafel slope of 46 mV dec(-1) and excellent stability in 0.5 M H2SO4. The X-ray Photo-electronic Spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the charge transfers from NC to VC, causing moderate H binding energy. This novel concept can be extended to prepare ultrafine metal oxides, carbides, and nitrides nanodots.									7	0	0	0	0	0	7			0378-7753	1873-2755		WOS:000621172800002

Herein, we present the exploratory research on nickel foam supported heterostructures of NiCo hydrogen carbonate (Ni0.6Co0.4(HCO3)(2)) with Pt nanoparticles on the surface for alkaline water hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterogeneous engineering ensures effective synergism of moderate hydrogen adsorption energy, accelerated catalysis kinetics, improved active sites, and enhanced charge transfer, thus inducing excellent HER activity (56 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for geometric area and 15 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for electrochemical surface area) and stable durability. Notably, the mass activity of Pt in Pt-Ni0.6Co0.4(HCO3)(2) is even higher than that of Pt/C. This study provides new insights into developing high-efficiency catalysts for hydrogen electrocatalysis, which also demonstrates that hydrogen carbonates are promising alternatives for electrochemical water splitting in addition to the widely focused transition metal hydroxides and oxides.

Herein, we report the synthesis of two different nickel selenide nano structures of different morphology and composition employing hydrothermal method. NiSe2 nanosheets were obtained by the anion-exchange reaction of Ni(OH)(2) with Se ions for 15 h. On the other hand, NiSe nanoflakes were synthesized by the direct selenization of nickel surface with the reaction time of 2 h. Tested as an electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction, NiSe2 nanosheets and NiSe nanoflakes can afford a geometric current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of 198 mV and 217 mV respectively. The measured Tafel slope values of NiSe nanoflakes are 28.6 mV dec(-1), which is three times lower as compared with NiSe2 nanosheets (72.1 mV dec(-1)). These results indicates the HER kinetics of NiSe nanoflakes are at par with the state-of-the-art Pt/C catalyst and also complimented with the short synthesis time of 2 h. Further, both nickel selenides exhibit ultra-long term stability for 30 h as evident from constant current chronopotentiometry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results.

The study was carried out under a hydrodynamic regime in the absence of oxygen. As time passes, the cathodic diffusion-limited current density (i(ilm)) and the anodic Tafel slope (beta(alpha)) increase, and from a given time they begin to decrease until reaching a nearly constant value. changes are due to a balance between activation and diffusion control and not to a change in the copper dissolution reaction. The steady state is the result of a balance between the separation from the surface of the corrosion products precipitated-due to the fluid flow-and the deposition of the new corrosion products formed; this leads to a limiting film thickness and a nearly constant diffusion rate. The corrosion products were characterized by energy-dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis and by x-ray powder diffraction. Data show the corrosion products could be a mixture of hydroxides, oxides, and copper bromide where copper is mainly present in the Cu(II) state; so, it would imply an evolution from Cu(I) to Cu(II).									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			0010-9312	1938-159X		WOS:000234841600007

However, owing to its extremely fast kinetics, kinetic data can only be obtained with experimental setups that provide very fast mass transport, so that the effect of hydrogen partial pressure (p(H2)) and kinetic limitations at high overpotentials are not yet fully understood. Here we report detailed kinetic investigations on the temperature and pressure dependence of the HOR/HER kinetics on carbon supported platinum (Pt/C) using the PEMFC-based H-2-pump approach. By using ultra-low platinum loadings, we could show that the apparent activation energy of the HOR/HER on platinum increases with increasing p(H2), due to a diminishing effect of the hydrogen adsorption enthalpy with increasing coverage by adsorbed hydrogen atoms on the Pt surface. Consequently, the HOR/HER reaction order with respect to p(H2) also depends on the temperature. We further observed that the HOR reaches a limiting current at high HOR overpotentials that showed a direct proportionality to p(H2) and a pressure-independent activation energy. We ascribe this to a limitation of the hydrogen adsorption rate either by a rate limiting Tafel-reaction or mass transport limitations. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

The electrochemical NO3- reduction reactions (NO(3)RRs) of a series of transition-metal-doped hexagonal boron phosphide (h-BP) monolayers were comprehensively evaluated using density functional theory. The V-doped h-BP monolayer was found to stand near the top of the volcano plot with the limiting potential of -0.22 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, exhibiting the lowest overpotential among the investigated systems in this work. Besides, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction is significantly suppressed due to the weak adsorption of the H atom. Importantly, the structure of the V-doped h-BP monolayer can be retained very well until 900 K, illustrating the initial indication of high thermal stability and great promise for synthesis. This study not only offers an eligible NO3RR electrocatalyst but also provides an atomic understanding of the behind mechanisms of the NO3RR process.									23	0	0	0	1	0	23			1948-7185			WOS:000647271500014	33872506

These thermal desorption spectra were similar to each other. This means that the gas evolution spectra do not depend on the preparation methods of the powders, but depend on the surface conditions of the iron.Surface compounds of iron UFPs after exposure to air and their role in the passivity in air were also investigated from the thermal desorption characteristics of the iron UFPs prepared by the vaporization method. After reduction, re-slow oxidation and followed by exposure to water vapour or mixture of water vapour and oxygen, thermal desorption experiments were carried out for the iron UFPs prepared by a vaporization method. The surface layers of iron UFPs consisted of Fe3O4, gamma-Fe2O3 and iron oxyhydroxide. The formation of Fe3O4 or gamma-Fe2O3 on the clean iron surface and followed by the formation of iron oxyhydroxide on these oxides were effective for the stabilization of the powder against atmospheric oxidation (corrosion). We demonstrate that iron UFPs, which have a large specific surface area, are excellent as a sample for the investigation of the gas adsorption and desorption characteristics of the iron surface.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0021-4876	1880-6880		WOS:A1991FN21100010

Here, four kinds of well-coupled MnxPdy (MnPd3, MnPd-Pd, Mn2Pd3, Mn2Pd3-Mn11Pd21)/C NHs have been synthesized by in situ integration of MnxPdy NCs with variable component ratios on pretreated Vulcan XC-72 C using the solvothermal method accompanied with annealing under Ar/H-2 atmosphere and used as electrocatalysts for ORR Among them, the MnPd3/C NHs possess the unique "half-embedded and half-encapsulated" interfaces and exhibit the highest catalytic activity, which can compete with some currently reported non-Pt catalysts (e.g., Ag-Co nanoalloys, Pd2NiAg NCs, PdCo/N-doped porous C, G-Cu3Pd nanocomposites, etc.), and close to commercial Pt/C. Electrocatalytic dynamic measurements disclose that their ORR mechanism abides by the direct 4e(-) pathway. Moreover, their durability and methanol-tolerant capability are much higher than that of Pt/C. As revealed by spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, the excellent catalytic performance of MnPd3/C NHs results from the proper component ratio of Mn and Pd and the strong interplay of their constituents, which not only facilitate to optimize the d-band center or the electronic structure of Pd but also induce the phase transformation of MnPd3 active components and enhance their conductivity or interfacial electron transfer dynamics. This work demonstrates that MnPd3/C NHs are promising methanol-tolerant cathode electrocatalysts that may be employed in fuel cells or other renewable energy option.									18	0	0	0	0	0	18			1944-8244			WOS:000427204100069	29384648

Herein, we describe our recent work studying HER at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES), between water vertical bar 1,2-dichloroethane. This is a unique platform for evaluating the kinetics/thermodynamics for metallocene hydride formation using decamethylruthenocene. In this approach, an aqueous acid serves as the proton source and is pumped across the ITIES via an externally applied potential or the use of a phase transfer catalyst. Simulated curves developed using COMSOL Multiphysics software and compared to experimental ones, indicate a modified EC' (electrochemical-chemical) mechanism for the decamethylruthenocene hydride formation. In the proposed pathway, decamethylruthenocene hydride is metastable in 1,2-dichloroethane and persists on the time scale of the recorded cyclic voltammograms long enough to transfer to the aqueous phase where it quickly dissociates. This is evidenced through an asymmetric, ion transfer wave observed experimentally and concluded to be hydride transfer. Shake-flask experiments with head space gas sampling demonstrated that hydrogen production was observed only when the biphasic system was positively polarized, to favor proton transfer, and decamethylruthenocene was photoactivated. This approach, combining electrochemical, simulation, and chromatographic methods, brings new insight into the factors that underlie the mechanism and rates of hydride formation/dissociation at soft interfaces.									28	0	0	0	0	0	28			1932-7447			WOS:000365463000010		
J	Li, Yunling; Zhao, Jingzhe; Dan, Yuanyuan; Ma, Dechong; Zhao, Yan; Hou, Shengnan; Lin, Haibo; Wang, Zichen				Lin, Haibo/D-9483-2015				Low temperature aqueous synthesis of highly dispersed Co3O4 nanocubes and their electrocatalytic activity studies								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				166	1			428	434		10.1016/j.cej.2010.10.080				JAN 1 2011	2011	We report here a simple approach to the synthesis of highly dispersed Co3O4 nanocubes in higher yield by aqueous precipitation method at low temperatures (70-90 degrees C). The nanosized Co3O4 powders were directly achieved from Co(II) aqueous solution under alkaline and oxidizing conditions. TEM results indicate that the as-prepared Co3O4 has a cubic nanostructure with uniform size of about 20nm and narrow size distribution. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and infrared spectrum (IR) results show that the samples are Co3O4 in spinel structure. The objective Co3O4 nanocubes can be achieved in a wide range of experimental parameters, which can be preserved as stable suspension in distilled water or ethanol for several months with no obvious change. Appropriate reaction time and temperature should be controlled to get better crystallized Co3O4 nanocubes with perfect cubic appearance and good dispersibility. It is essential to achieve cubic-like Co3O4 particles by using ammonia as precipitator. The as-prepared Co3O4 nanocubes, combined with PbO2 as electrodes, extend improved electrocatalytic activities and decreased oxygen evolution potential in electrochemical reactions, so they can be used as potential electrode materials or electrocatalytic materials. This facile method for the synthesis of Co3O4 nanocubes is a simple and general process without any seed, catalyst, or template, thus it is promising for large-scale and low-cost production of Co3O4 with high-quality.

Comprehensive structural (XRD, SEM, TEM) and compositional (XPS) analyses were performed to understand the effects of the TiO2 shell on the PEC activities of the Fe2O3 core. It was revealed that the heterojunction structure formed between TiO2 and Fe2O3, significantly improved the separation efficiency of photo-induced charge carriers and the oxygen evolution kinetics. A maximum photocurrent density of similar to 900 mu A cm(-2) at 0.6 V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was obtained for the Fe2O3/TiO2 photoelectrodes, which was 5 and 18 times higher when compared to that of hydrothermally synthesized Fe2O3 and PECVD synthesized TiO2 electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the Fe2O3/TiO2 core-shell nanorod arrays displayed superior stability for PEC water splitting. During 5000 s PEC measurements, a steady decrease of the photocurrent was observed, mainly attributed to the evolution of oxygen bubbles adsorbed on the working electrodes. This observation was verified by the complete recovery of the PEC performance demonstrated for a second 5000 s PEC measurement carried out after a brief time interval (10 min) that allowed the electrode surface to regenerate.									64	3	0	0	3	0	64			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000355560200019	25980730

Because of coupling the copper substrates with aluminum foils, Co coatings were obtained on copper from a reducing agent-free plating solution and Co-P coatings were obtained without activation step at room temperature. The electrochemical experiments demonstrated the coupled aluminum foils could shift the potential of copper substrates negatively, and also donate electrons for the reduction of cobalt ions in the alkaline plating solutions. The morphology and composition of the Co and Co-P coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Compared with Co coatings, the Co-P coatings had larger deposition rates and were consisted of finer grains. Co and Co-P coatings showed nearly the same oxygen-evolution reaction electrocatalytic performance in 1.0 M KOH solution, which was superior to that of platinum plate. While, the Co-P coatings exhibited better electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen-evolution reaction in 1.0 M KOH solution than the Co coating, and could reach a current density of 40 mA.cm(-2) at overpotential of about 240 mV.									16	0	0	0	0	0	16			0257-8972			WOS:000447106400005		
J	Proshlyakov, DA; Pressler, MA; Babcock, GT								Dioxygen activation and bond cleavage by mixed-valence cytochrome c oxidase								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				95	14			8020	8025		10.1073/pnas.95.14.8020				JUL 7 1998	1998	Elucidating the structures of intermediates in the reduction of O-2 to water by cytochrome c oxidase is crucial to understanding both oxygen activation and proton pumping by the enzyme. In the work here, the reaction of O-2 with the mixed-valence enzyme, in which only heme a(3) and Cu-B in the binuclear center are reduced, has been followed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The results show that O=O bond cleavage occurs within the first 200 mu s after reaction initiation; the presence of a uniquely stable Fe-O-O(H) peroxy species is not detected. The product of this rapid reaction is a heme a(3) oxoferryl (Fe-IV=O) species, which requires that an electron donor in addition to heme a(3) and Cue must be involved. The available evidence suggests that the additional donor is an amino acid side chain. Recent crystallographic data [Yoshikawa, S,, Shinzawa-Itoh, K,, Nakashima, R, Yaono, R,, Yamashita, E,, Inoue, N,, Yao, M,, Fel, M, J,, Libeu, C, P,, Mizushima, T,, et nl. Science, in press; Ostermeier, C,, Harrenga, A, Ermler, U, & Michel, H, (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 10547-10553] show that one of the Cu-B ligands, His240, is cross-linked to Tyr244 and that this cross-linked tyrosyl is ideally positioned to participate in dioxygen activation. We propose a mechanism for O-O bond cleavage that proceeds by concerted hydrogen atom transfer from the cross-linked His-Tyr species to produce the product oxoferryl species, Cu-B(2+)-OH-, and the tyrosyl radical. This mechanism provides molecular structures for two key intermediates that drive the proton pump in oxidase; moreover, it has clear analogies to the proposed O-O bond forming chemistry that occurs during O-2 evolution in photosynthesis.									290	0	3	0	179	1	294			0027-8424			WOS:000074717300034	9653133

The development of electrochemical catalysts with low cost and high turn-over efficiency, or the usage of a photoanode in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell using a semiconductor with a proper protective layer are among the possible solutions. Herein, a binary alloy film of Ni-Co grown under self-limiting electrodeposition conditions is investigated and continuous ultrathin films with various compositions are generated. The self-limiting deposition mechanism is validated by potential transients and XPS depth profiles; both methods support a film thickness independent of electrodeposition time when the self-limiting deposition condition is attained with a deposition time no more than 1s. The Ni-Co alloy film exhibits a reduced potential of 217 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) for electrochemical water oxidation kinetics compared to pure Ni in 1M KOH solution, with an optimum Ni2+/(Ni2++Co2+) fraction of 0.75. The Ni-Co film deposited on GaAs is further investigated for photoelectrochemical oxidation in a ferri/ferrocyanide solution while the stability towards photocorrosion under light in an aqueous solution containing K3Fe(CN)(6)/K4Fe(CN)(6) is significantly enhanced, resulting in a photocurrent retention improvement from 82.4 to 91.8% in the first 300s.

Herein, we report an atom-like Pt@PtSAs co-catalyst on polymeric carbon nitride nanosheets (PCNS), where the mutual-modification effect exists in nucleus-like Pt NPs and diffuse PtSAs with sub-nanometer inter-site distances (Pt@PtSAs) to enhance the catalytic activities. The adjacent Pt NPs and PtSAs act as the modulators to tailor the d-band electronic states of each other through strong electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI) at PtSAs-PCNS-Pt NPs interface, resulting in enhanced intrinsic H-2 evolution activity of Pt@PtSAs sites. The EMSI also accelerates photoexcited electron transfer from PCNS to Pt@PtSAs sites to participate in H-2 evolution reaction. Consequently, the Pt@PtSAs-decorated PCNS exhibits an unexpectedly photocatalytic H2 evolution rate up to 15.75 mmol g(-1) h(-1) under visible light, 1.9 times higher than that of PtSAs-decorated PCNS. This work sheds light on the synergistic mechanism among metal NPs and SAs and provides a valuable strategy to design highly efficient photocatalysts.									8	0	0	0	0	0	8			1385-8947	1873-3212		WOS:000806375900002

Herein, a facile, low cost, and scalable method is provided for the fabrication of Mo2C-based eletrocatalyst (Mo2C/G-NCS) by a spray-drying, and followed by annealing. As-prepared Mo2C/G-NCS electrocatalyst displays that ultrafine Mo2C nanopartilces are uniformly embedded into graphene wrapping N-doped porous carbon microspheres derived from chitosan. Such designed structure offer several favorable features for hydrogen evolution application: 1) the ultrasmall size of Mo2C affords a large exposed active sites; 2) graphene-wrapping ensures great electrical conductivity; 3) porous structure increases the electrolyte-electrode contact points and lowers the charge transfer resistance; 4) N-dopant interacts with H+ better than C atoms and favorably modifies the electronic structures of adjacent Mo and C atoms. As a result, the Mo2C/G-NCS demonstrates superior HER activity with a very low overpotential of 70 or 66 mV to achieve current density of 10 mA cm(-2), small Tafel slope of 39 or 37 mV dec(-1), respectively, in acidic and alkaline media, and high stability, indicating that it is a great potential candidate as HER electrocatalyst.									107	8	2	0	4	0	112				2198-3844		WOS:000428310500029	29593973

Evolution of Earth-like Planetary Atmospheres around M Dwarf Stars: Assessing the Atmospheres and Biospheres with a Coupled Atmosphere Biogeochemical Model								ASTROBIOLOGY				18	7			856	872		10.1089/ast.2017.1723				JUL 2018	2018	Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs are prominent targets when searching for life outside the Solar System. We apply our Coupled Atmosphere Biogeochemical model to investigate the coupling between the biosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere in order to gain insight into the atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs and to understand the processes affecting biosignatures and climate on such worlds. This is the first study applying an automated chemical pathway analysis quantifying the production and destruction pathways of molecular oxygen (O-2) for an Earth-like planet with an Archean O-2 concentration orbiting in the habitable zone of the M dwarf star AD Leonis, which we take as a type-case of an active M dwarf. The main production arises in the upper atmosphere from carbon dioxide photolysis followed by catalytic hydrogen oxide radical (HOx) reactions. The strongest destruction does not take place in the troposphere, as was the case in Gebauer et al. (2017) for an early Earth analog planet around the Sun, but instead in the middle atmosphere where water photolysis is the strongest. Results further suggest that these atmospheres are in absolute terms less destructive for O-2 than for early Earth analog planets around the Sun despite higher concentrations of reduced gases such as molecular hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. Hence smaller amounts of net primary productivity are required to oxygenate the atmosphere due to a change in the atmospheric oxidative capacity, driven by the input stellar spectrum resulting in shifts in the intrafamily HOx partitioning. Under the assumption that an atmosphere of an Earth-like planet survived and evolved during the early high-activity phase of an M dwarf to an Archean-type composition, a possible Great Oxidation Event, analogous to that on Early Earth, would have occurred earlier in time after the atmospheric composition was reached, assuming the same atmospheric O-2 sources and sinks as on early Earth.

Herein, we use hybrid density functional theory to rationally design the charge-compensated codoped h-ZnSe sheets, which are simulated by substituting Sb for Se atom, and Sc or Y for Zn atom, for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting to produce hydrogen. It is demonstrated that the Sc-Sb and Y-Sb codoped sheets are energetically favorable compared with Sc, Y, Sb-monodoped sheets because dopants have strong Coulombic interactions with other atoms, and moreover, have the effectively reduced bandgap, the larger absorption region of visible light, and appropriate band edges positions with respect to the water redox level. Meanwhile, compared to monodoped sheets, the codoped sheets do not introduce charge-imbalance defects or unoccupied impurity states which promote the electron-hole recombination. Furthermore, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are easier driven by photogenerated carriers due to the largely reduced overpotentials and ample active sites on the codoped sheets. Thus, the Sc-Sb and Y-Sb codoped h-ZnSe sheets can be promising photocatalysts for visible-light-driven water decomposition to generate hydrogen. (c) 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The inclusions in steel before and after the FeCr alloy additions were investigated through systematic samplings and microscopy investigations of the liquid steel. Different types of inclusions in the FeCr alloy and steel were detected and the evolution of the inclusion characteristics (e.g., composition, size, morphology, and number density) were investigated. The results showed that the Ti content decreased after the FeCr alloy additions. Furthermore, MnCr2O4 spinel inclusions originating from the FeCr alloys transformed into Ti2O3-Cr2O3-based liquid inclusions and Ti2O3-rich solid inclusions. They were formed due to the reactions between MnCr2O4 and TiN inclusions or dissolved Ti in molten steel. The ratio of Ti/Al in the steel melt has a direct influence on the evolution of inclusions from thermodynamic calculations. The addition of FeCr alloys caused an increased number density of these Ti2O3-containing inclusions and TiN inclusions up to 8 minutes from the time of alloy addition. The increased Cr content from 16 to 24 mass pct due to the FeCr additions can increase the critical N content to form TiN inclusions at a specific Ti content. Overall, this study has contributed to the understanding the behavior of inclusions from LCFeCr alloy during the alloying process in Ti-containing steel.									6	0	0	0	0	0	5			1073-5615	1543-1916		WOS:000693877000003

Here, the formation pathway of Ni-rich layered ordered LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (O-LNCM622O) is carefully characterized using in situ synchrotron radiation diffraction. A fast nonequilibrium phase transition from the reactants to a metastable disordered Li-1-(x)(Ni0.6Co0.2Mn0.2)(1+)O-x(2) (D-LNCM622O, 0 < x < 0.95) takes place while lithium/oxygen is incorporated during heating before the generation of the equilibrium phase (O-LNCM622O). The time evolution of the lattice parameters for layered nonstoichiometric D-LNCM622O is well-fitted to a model of first-order disorder-to-order transition. The long-range cation disordering parameter, Li/TM (TM = Ni, Co, Mn) ion exchange, decreases exponentially and finally reaches a steady-state as a function of heating time at selected temperatures. The dominant kinetic pathways revealed here will be instrumental in achieving high-performance cathode materials. Importantly, the O-LNCM622O tends to form the D-LNCM622O with Li/O loss above 850 degrees C. In situ XRD results exhibit that the long-range cationic (dis)ordering in the Ni-rich cathodes could affect the structural evolution during cycling and thus their electrochemical properties. These insights may open a new avenue for the kinetic control of the synthesis of advanced electrode materials.									17	0	0	0	0	0	17			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000621910200001

However, the activating voltages have a great impact on the electrochemical performances. Herein, we explore the effects of the activating voltages on the electrochemical performances of Li1.17Ni0.139Co0.139Mn0.552O2 cathode materials. The activating voltages can mainly affect the capacity release, rather than the cycling characteristics. The comparison study reveals that the layered structure can transform into spinel and/or nickel enriched structure due to the cation migration and the hardly-being reduced transition metals, especially for the Ni4(+) during activation. Meanwhile, the surface side-reactions would also deteriorate the lithium kinetic characteristics, but the formed byproducts coated on the cathode surface can resist the further attack from electrolyte, which favors to the following cycles. The Li1.17Ni0.139Co0.139Mn0.552O2 cathode materials activated to 4.6 V with 25 mA.g(-1) can deliver capacities of 262.0 and 209.2 mAh.g(-1) over 2.0-4.8/4.4 V at 1C (250 mA.g(-1)) and the highest energy densities.

Modification of electrodeposited copper foam with poly(acrylamide) leads to a significant enhancement in faradaic efficiency for ethylene from 13% (unmodified foam) to 26% at -0.96 V vs RHE, whereas methane yield is unaffected. Effects from crystalline phase distribution and copper oxide phases are ruled out as the source of enhancement through XPS and in situ XRD analysis. DFT calculations reveal that poly(acrylamide) adsorbs on the copper surface via the oxygen atom on the carbonyl groups and enhances ethylene formation by (i) charge donation to the copper surface that activates CO for dimerization, (ii) chemical stabilization of the CO dimer (a key intermediate for C-2 products) by hydrogen-bond interactions with the -NH2 group, and (iii) facilitating the adsorption of CO molecules near the polymer, increasing local surface coverage. Poly(acrylamide) with copper acts as a multipoint binding catalytic system where the interplay between activation and stabilization of intermediates results in enhanced selectivity toward ethylene formation. Modification with poly(acrylic acid) which has a similar structure to poly(acrylamide) also shows some enhancement in activity but is unstable, whereas poly(allylamine) completely suppresses CO2 reduction in favor of the hydrogen evolution reaction.									94	3	0	0	6	0	93			2155-5435			WOS:000431727300046

This perspective discusses the state-of-the-art understanding of CO2 and CO reduction electrocatalysis and provides an overview of the most promising approaches undertaken thus far. We set to explore "bifunctional" catalysts using Au-Cd based alloys inspired by theoretical modelling. Density functional theory calculations suggest more favourable thermodynamics for CO2 reduction to CO and methanol on mixed Au-Cd sites on Au3Cd relative to similar values on Au. We use various tools to test the bulk and surface alloys experimentally. We find that Au3Cd in neutral media exhibits lower CO evolution activity than Au, and Au-Cd alloys also show negligible activity for CO reduction in alkaline media. This indicates that the mixed CdAu sites predicted to be catalytically active are not present in the sample. The catalytic performance is most consistent with Au-terminated step surface on a bulk alloy, possibly formed through adsorbate induced restructuring. We highlight that future bimetallic catalysts must consider potential-dependent surface restructuring effects caused by reaction intermediates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The TEM images display that the gold nanoparticles were embedded into the B-TiO2 framework.

In turn, it gives rise to surface or near-surface states facilitating the embedment of Au nanoparticles, as demonstrated by the Au 4f XPS spectra, which indicates the strong interaction between gold and the B-TiO2 framework. This specific synergy significantly contributes to the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. For the first time, the isotopic tracer studies using a gas chromatograph isotope ratio mass spectrometer along with a series of control experiments reveal that the produced hydrogen originated mainly from water rather than methanol, whereas the direct oxidation of methanol did not lead to hydrogen generation.

The prepared CdS/ZnO coupled semiconductor catalysts were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. XRD analysis indicated the presence of a wurtzite structure for all the prepared CdS/ZnO compositions. DRS spectrum showed red shift in the absorbance edge of CdS/ZnO nanocomposites with increasing CdS mol% and absorbance increases in 400 to 500 nm range. Photoluminescence spectra illustrated two emission peaks, with the first one at 390 nm due to the band edge emission of ZnO and the second broad peak centered around 480 nm possibly due to CdS band edge emission or oxygen vacancies in ZnO. FESEM image showed the formation of pencil shaped one-dimensional ZnO nanorods containing spherical CdS nanoparticles on the surface of ZnO. TEM analysis confirms the rod-like morphology of ZnO and the presence of CdS nanoparticles. The activity of the prepared CdS/ZnO catalysts was evaluated by measuring the amount of H-2 generated during photocatalytic H-2 evolution from water. The photocatalytic activity of prepared coupled CdS/ZnO shows an increase in hydrogen generation compared to that of individual ones. CdS loading enhances the rate of H-2 generation and is the highest for 5 mol% CdS/ZnO composition.									33	0	0	0	1	0	33			2046-2069			WOS:000343035800068

Herein, the novel electrocatalyst, porous carbon-coated Ni//beta-Mo2C (Ni/beta-Mo2C@PC), possesses favorable hydrogen production performance and stability in a wide range of pH via a facile dicyandiamide-blowing and one-step synthesis method. The resultant Ni/beta-Mo2C@PC displays pleasurable HER performance with low overpotentials of 123, 155, and 179 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1 M KOH, 0.5 M H2SO4, and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS), respectively. Furthermore, Ni/beta-Mo2C@PC retains high durability with quite little decay after 24 h stability test, suggesting the excellent activity and stability of Ni/beta-Mo2C@PC served as HER electrocatalysts. Otherwise, it is advantageous compared with Ni@PC, Mo2C@PC, and most other nonprecious metal electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the two popular active species, uniform distribution, and porous carbon coating, these porous nanoelectrocatalysts showcase satisfactory electrocatalytic activity, improving the charge transfer and kinetics during the reaction. This work possesses significant universality, which can be applicable to the synthesis of diverse nanostructured noble metal-free catalysts.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2470-1343			WOS:000473361500086	31460128

Such events release reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are endowed with high mutagenic potential. In this study, we evaluated how the operation of the background metabolic network by an environmental bacterium may either foster or curtail the still-evolving pathway for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) catabolism. To this end, the genetically tractable strain Pseudomonas putida EM173 was implanted with the whole genetic complement necessary for the complete biodegradation of 2,4-DNT (recruited from the environmental isolate Burkholderia sp. R34). By using reporter technology and direct measurements of ROS formation, we observed that the engineered P. putida strain experienced oxidative stress when catabolizing the nitroaromatic substrate. However, the formation of ROS was neither translated into significant activation of the SOS response to DNA damage nor did it result in a mutagenic regime (unlike what has been observed in Burkholderia sp. R34, the original host of the pathway). To inspect whether the tolerance of P. putida to oxidative challenges could be traced to its characteristic reductive redox regime, we artificially altered the NAD(P)H pool by means of a water-forming, NADH-specific oxidase. Under the resulting low-NAD(P)H status, catabolism of 2,4-DNT triggered a conspicuous mutagenic and genomic diversification scenario. These results indicate that the background biochemical network of environmental bacteria ultimately determines the evolvability of metabolic pathways. Moreover, the data explain the efficacy of some bacteria (e.g., pseudomonads) to host and evolve with new catabolic routes.IMPORTANCE Some environmental bacteria evolve with new capacities for the aerobic biodegradation of chemical pollutants by adapting preexisting redox reactions to novel compounds. The process typically starts by cooption of enzymes from an available route to act on the chemical structure of the substrate-to-be. The critical bottleneck is generally the first biochemical step, and most of the selective pressure operates on reshaping the initial reaction. The interim uncoupling of the novel substrate to preexisting Rieske nonheme iron oxygenases usually results in formation of highly mutagenic ROS. In this work, we demonstrate that the background metabolic regime of the bacterium that hosts an evolving catabolic pathway (e.g., biodegradation of the xenobiotic 2,4-DNT) determines whether the cells either adopt a genetic diversification regime or a robust ROS-tolerant status. Furthermore, our results offer new perspectives to the rational design of efficient whole-cell biocatalysts, which are pursued in contemporary metabolic engineering.									38	0	0	0	34	0	38			2150-7511			WOS:000443884300082	30154264

We devise an electroless deposition method to fabricate a Pt monolayer and use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to characterize its atomic structures. This method involves the use of carbon monoxide (CO) molecules as the reducing agent for PtCl62- complexes, yielding a CO-capped Pt film on an Au(111) substrate. The deposition of the Pt film stops at one atom thick. To expose the Pt film, the CO adlayer is stripped off by pulsing the potential to 0.96 V (vs hydrogen reversible electrode) for 3 s in H-2-saturated 0.1 M H2SO4. Atomic resolution STM imaging shows that the Pt adatoms arrange in two hexagonal arrays with different atomic corrugation patterns and a notable difference (5.5%) in the Pt-Pt distance at 0.1 V. The Pt film with a larger interatomic spacing of 0.287 nm is 2X more active than that of Pt(111), and may be the most active catalyst toward hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER and HOR) reported thus far.									14	0	0	0	0	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000410597600029

In this work, micro-amount copper-doped nickle phosphide-selenide hetero-nanosheets electrocatalyst (Cu-NiPx/NiSey) is prepared on nickel foam by one-step phosphorus-selenization. The introduction of Cu facilitates the formation of multicomponent NiPx/NiSey heterostructures, and can also introduce a significant electronic modulation effect to produce high-valent Ni sites and NiOOH active species, benefiting for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The high intrinsic catalytic activity of nickle phosphide is compatible well with the high electrical conductivity of selenide, resulting in complementary enhancement of catalytic activity for Cu-NiPx/NiSey. As a result, the CuNiPx/NiSey electrodes exhibit extremely low overpotentials in 1 M KOH solution of 264 mV for OER at a current density of 100 mA cm &#xfffd; 2, and 69 mV for HER at 10 mA cm &#xfffd; 2. Importantly, when Cu-NiPx/NiSey is assembled as both electrodes, a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 can be achieved for over 60 h with only an ultra-low battery voltage of 1.71 V, exceeding most reported nickel-based bifunctional catalysts. The present work delivers a new strategy for designing and constructing effective bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical largescale water splitting.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000863042200003

Here, a free-standing and heterointerfaces-rich fluffy rectangular spongy-like core-shell NiS/CoS/CC-3 bifunctional electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is designed and synthesized by optimizing the thickness of the NiS shell. The electrochemical performance of the NiS/CoS/CC-3 electrocatalyst is investigated in alkaline solutions. Benefiting from the unique rectangular spongy-like structural features, the abundant heterointerfaces between NiS and CoS, as well as the good synergy between its each component, the obtained NiS/CoS/CC-3 catalyst shows outstanding electrocatalytic activities and stability for both HER and OER. The overpotential is 102 mV for HER and 290 mV for OER at 10 mA cm(-2), respectively. Moreover, the two-NiS/CoS/CC-3 as both the cathode and anode catalyst in alkaline solution achieves a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a potential of 1.57 V. Meanwhile, the electrolyzer shows outstanding electrochemistry durability with an unchanged current density for 72 h. The results illustrate that the as-prepared heterointerfaces-rich NiS/CoS/CC-3 electrocatalyst can be used as a high-efficiency catalyst for overall water splitting (OWS). This synthetic strategy is also important for other composite materials in a variety of energy-related application fields.									4	0	0	0	0	0	4			0927-7757	1873-4359		WOS:000596078600003

Taking advantage of the novel heptagonal ring substructure on the sphere and the electron-deficient nature of boron, the atomic metals are facile to reside on B-40 to form atomically dispersed eta(7)-B40M exohedral complexes. Among a series of candidates, originating from the proper metal-adsorbate interactions, the atomic tungsten-decorated B40W is screened out as the most feasible catalyst for the NRR with a low over-potential and high selectivity to passivate the competitive hydrogen evolution process.									5	0	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000612961700070	33463647

Herein, highly efficient bifunctional NiCo2O4-based heterostructure electrocatalysts have been designed by loading different amount of CoFe-layered double hydroxide on the self-supported nickel foam (CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF-1, CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF-2 and CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF-3) by a facile hydrothermal method. The CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF with optimal amount electrocatalyst enable excellent catalytic activity for OER and HER, such as a small of Tafel slope, low overpotential as well as good stability, surpassing RuO2, Pt/C and the majority of other NiCo2O4 based electrocatalysts. The unprecedented electrocatalytic performance is benefiting from high electrochemical active surface areas, fast charge transfer and strong synergistic effect between CoFe-LDH and NiCo2O4. Furthermore, the optimal CoFe-LDH/NCO/NF-1 as anode and cathode delivers a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a low cell voltage of 1.65 V and presents good durability in long-term stability test for overall water splitting. This work provides an effective strategy for development of highly efficient NiCo2O4-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting application in the future. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Benefiting from the excellent synergistic effect between Co3O4 and MoO3, fencelike Co3O4@MoO3 exhibited enhanced HER performance of low overpotential (158 mV at 10 mA cm-2) and small Tafel slope (148 mV dec(- 1)), thereby indicating the higher intrinsic catalytic kinetics in fencelike Co3O4@MoO3. From DFT results, the high electrocatalytic HER performance was attributed to the excellent electronic regulation of Co3O4. Simultaneously, MoO3 could serve as electron transport medium and thus migrate the electron transfer trend of Co3O4 -> MoO3 -> H2O. Therefore, an electron-rich region around H2O was formed due to electrons accumulation, facilitating the decomposition of H2O. Furthermore, Co3O4@MoO3 showed a more negative E-H2O* (-4.94 eV) than that of Co3O4 (6.09 eV) and MoO3 (1.72 eV). Besides, the d orbital center of Co atom displayed a positive shift from-1.27 to-1.22 eV, demonstrating that Co could directly facilitate the activization and decomposition of H2O. What's more, after introducing Co3O4 in MoO3, the H-O bond of H2O was extended from 0.989 to 0.990 & Aring;, which directly confirmed that the synergistic effect between Co(3)O(4 )and MoO3 could facilitate H-O bond breaking.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-4332	1873-5584		WOS:000805831100001

The major challenges in constructing catalysts are assuring the rapid conversion of catalyzed processes and maintaining high selectivity to desired products. Bimetallic nanoparticles always exhibit exceptional catalytic performance, owing to the different ensemble and electronic structures induced by alloying as well as the synergistic effects. However, avoiding aggregation during the reaction process to reduce the passivation or poison of the metal site is still a serious problem. Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) with excellent thermal and chemical stability is now a promising multifunctional catalyst and co-catalyst for its superior catalytic, optical and electronic properties. Recently, PCN modified by bimetallic nanoparticles with distinct functionalities has sparked considerable interest in the field of redox catalysis, electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. Due to synergistic effects between different components, the combined bimetallic nanoparticles/PCN materials show much improved activity. Referring to this review, we systematically detailed the synthesis path of bimetallic nanoparticles/PCN composites and their applications in different catalytic fields with particular emphasis on the synergistic mechanism. Ultimately, the challenges and perspectives faced in this subject have been presented. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			0010-8545	1873-3840		WOS:000820258800001

Another 10 vol% MoSi2 containing composite sintered at 1800 degrees C for comparison. Microstructure examinations showed that by adding 5 vol% MoSi2, the grain growth in the matrix reduced considerably. However, 10 vol% MoSi2 addition is needed, at least, to avoid the grain growth in the matrix. Phase analysis by XRD after sintering revealed HfB2, MoSi2 as the main phases, and some SiC and MoB as the secondary phases. The presence of these secondary phases and a meaningful reduction in HfO2 contamination by MoSi2 introduction, along with the formation of a (Hf,Mo) B-2 solid-solution, implied that some chemical reactions occurred during the sinter. Thermodynamic calculations at the sintering temperature suggested the decomposition of MoSi2 into Si and Mo as the first step of chemical evolution. Subsequently, Silicon conversion to SiC and SiO2 facilitated by Oxygen and carbon supplied mainly by the atmosphere. (Hf,Mo)B-2 solid-solution formation is a result of free Mo diffusion into the matrix, likewise. An intermediate reaction between MoSi2 and B2O3 contamination rationalized the HfO2 content decrease and the MoB presence. The early SiO2 formation and enhanced diffusion due to the solid-solution development were both responsible for the grain growth inhibition in the matrix.									3	0	0	0	0	0	3			0254-0584	1879-3312		WOS:000595150900001

Herein, we proposed a synergistic coupling catalyst by anchoring the heteroatom B-Co dimer into porous C2N (B-Co@C2N) for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into ethane via applying first-principles calculations. The formation of the B-Co dimer can effectively modulate the Co-3d orbital toward lower energy levels, which weakens CO adsorption strength compared with Co-Co@C2N and leads to a low C-C coupling energy barrier of similar to 0.61 eV. The undesirable hydrogen evolution reaction is drastically suppressed due to the strong adsorption of the *CO2/*COOH intermediate with positive limiting potential difference of U-L(CO2)-U-L(H-2). More importantly, the light absorbance of B-Co@C2N is significantly enhanced in the visible and infrared light range compared with that of pure C2N. The high binding energy combined with the AIMD simulations ensured structural stability and feasibility for future experimental synthesis. Our proposed synergy concept of single metal atom and nonmetal atom hybrids is expected to open a new avenue toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction into multi-carbon products under visible light.									12	2	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000585127100037

Oxidation of the obtained Fe/Fe-oxide films at 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, and 800 degrees C in air yielded porous alpha-Fe2O3 thin films. The advantage of using Fe/Fe-oxide NPs is that they form stable suspensions in organic solvents and are suitable for spin coating. The highest photocurrent density of 0.75 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 V (vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) was achieved with an alpha-Fe2O3 thin film calcined at 800 degrees C. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data showed that the quantum efficiency of the thin films was about 15% at 350 nm at an applied bias of 1.4V vs. RHE. To improve the oxygen evolution reaction, we electrodeposited a Ni(OH)(2)/NiOOH catalyst (given as NiOOH) onto the alpha-Fe2O3 film and achieved the reduction of onset potential from 0.85 to 0.69 V vs. RHE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and open-circuit photovoltage (OCP) measurements were used to estimate the flat-band potential of the thin films. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the treatment of leachate concentrates would consume high energy or a large amount of chemicals. The present study is to develop an effective treatment method by using coupled electrochemical methods with the least possible energy consumption. The leachate concentrates was pretreated by electrocoagulation (EC), with aluminum or iron electrodes as anodes, to decrease the dissolved organic content. EC with Al electrode was found to be more efficient by consuming 1.25 kWh/m(3) energy to remove 70% of total organic carbon (TOC). EC effluent was further subjected to a novel simultaneous electro-oxidation and in-situ peroxone process, which used a Ti-based nickel and antimony doped fin dioxide (NATO) as anode and a carbon nanotube coated carbon-polytetrafluoroethylene (CNT-C/PTFE) as cathode for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Compared with a traditional EO with cathode for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER-EO), ORR-EO obtained higher efficiency and an energy consumption of 26.25 kWh/m(3), which was much lower than 35.5 kWh/m(3) for HER-EO. Results showed that after ORR-EO, a final TOC of 57.3 mg/L was obtained. Thus, EC in tandem with ORR-EO process has an excellent capability and economic merit in the field of treating leachate concentrates.									21	2	0	0	7	0	23			0013-9351	1096-0953		WOS:000526177500035	32311906

Single atomic electrocatalysts (SACs), including platinum (Pt) SACs, play a key role in catalysis owing to the similar to 100% utilization of the desired atom thus minimizing the usage of noble metals. Herein, we show a facile method to atomically anchor Pt atoms on TiO2 nanosheets modified with graphene (Pt@TiO2/NSG with an ultralow Pt loading of 1.61 wt%). The atomic dispersion of Pt on TiO2/NSG structure was confirmed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and was anchored by numerous surface functional groups on abundant exposed basal planes in TiO2/NSG heterostructure. Benefiting from the synergetic effect due to the interaction between active centers, Pt SACs, and the TiO2/NSG substrate, the Pt@TiO2/NSG electrocatalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity toward HER in an acidic electrolyte, with a low overpotential of 38 mV to reach 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope of 40 mV/dec, and a decent durability for the 1000th cycles of HER polarization curve has only 1 mV shift, which is even better than those of commercial Pt/C benchmark electrocatalysts. This work supplies a strategy to realize the controllable development of Pt SACs with low cost, high activity, and long-term stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000849174600008

Ni mesh electrodes were also tested for comparison, since the Pt-based electrodes were supported on Ni meshes. The service life test was especially designed to highlight the robustness of the cathodes under conditions of polarity inversion and involved a sequence of galvanostatic polarisations in the h.e.r. range (to activate the electrodes), cyclic voltammetries taking the electrodes to potentials positive enough to evolve oxygen, slow potentiodynamic sweeps (to obtain pseudo-steady-state curves, and hence Tafel plots) and EIS measurements at various potentials in the h.e.r. range.EIS and steady-state results converged to indicate the strong activity and very good stability of the modified thermal Pt-based cathodes which underwent very little degradation upon polarity inversion. Composite Ni + RuO2 cathodes were not as active as Pt-based electrodes, but withstood polarity inversion with very limited loss of their activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, Yizeng; Gao, Junning; Chen, Zhiwu; Lu, Zhenya								Enhanced photocatalytic performance of Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets synthesized by a self-catalyzed fast reaction process								CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL				44	18			23014	23023		10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.09.103				DEC 15 2018	2018	Single-crystalline Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets with the exposed {001} facets have been successfully prepared using a novel self-catalyzed reaction route, which involves a fast reaction of Bi2O3 and TiO2 at 280 degrees C with the critical assistance of tartaric acid. It is believed that the formation of Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets is driven by the massive heat released during the oxidation of tartaric acid when Bi2O3 and TiO2 are mixed. With this simplified novel process, the synthesis of high quality Bi4Ti3O12 photocatalyst can be accomplished at low temperatures of 280 degrees C in less than 10 min. The as-obtained optimum nanosheet photocatalyst exhibits high visible light photodegradation of methyl orange, indicated by the 3.92 times higher efficiency than that of the Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets prepared by a widely acknowledged molten salt method. In addition, this Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheet photocatalyst presents high recycling ability and storage stability. The X-ray photoelectron spectrometer and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses reveal that oxygen vacancies are produced on the surface of as-prepared Bi4Ti3O12 nanosheets after the self-catalyzed reaction, which then extend the valence band width and reduce the band gap of the Bi4Ti3O12 photocatalyst. It is therefore concluded that the much enhanced photocatalytic activity of the as prepared catalyst is the synergistic effects of the valence band widening that increases the separation efficiency of the photo-generated carriers and the band gap narrowing that broadens the absorption edge of light.									9	0	0	0	1	0	9			0272-8842	1873-3956		WOS:000452345500125

ID to 2D nanostructures were symmetrically evolved along the longitudinal axis (gas flow direction) of the microchannel. On the basis of the experimental conditions, the changes in the vapor composition along the channel length could be predicted by a simple chemical vapor diffusion modeling. It was revealed that the Zn vapor composition under a high oxygen pressure is one of the critical parameters responsible for evolution from ID to 2D nanostructures.									1	0	0	0	0	0	1			1932-7447			INSPEC:10619613

Theoretical computations identify B-dopants as the pivotal active sites to enhance NO3- activation and optimize the free energies of reaction intermediates, leading to the expe-dited NO3RR activity. Meanwhile, the undesired hydrogen evolution can be well suppressed on B-MoS2 to render a high NO3RR selectivity. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, crystalline g-C3N4 was modified with K+, Ni and N-doped carbon by thermal-polymerization of Ni2+-anchored and polyvinyl pyrrolidone-encapsulated melamine-cyanuric acid supramolecules, followed by re-calcination in a KCl-LiCl mixture. The obtained strip-like g-C3N4 nanocrystals exhibited high charge separation efficiency and good light absorption capability. Density-functional theory calculations confirmed that the orbital hybridization of Ni-N atoms enabled the formation of charge-transfer channels, which can capture electrons, achieve enhanced oxygen adsorption and reduction via a two-electron pathway. Under the synergistic effects of K+, Ni and N-doped carbon dopants and crystallinity, the obtained sample exhibited high photocatalytic H2O2 yields of 79.6 mu M in O-2-saturated pure water, which was 10-fold higher than the yield using pristine g-C3N4. This work provides a novel design for production of highly efficient photocatalysts for H2O2 production.									2	0	0	0	0	0	2			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000710573600001

Two kinds of novel metastable phases with a composition of Sn(IV)(0.6)(Nb(V)(0.8)Sn(IV)(0.2))O-3.6 could be synthesized. Further, the other novel metastable phase with the same composition was found as a phase contained. One of the metastable phases was the cubic K-CeZrO4 related-type possessing the fluorite-related structure, which was formed by the cation diffusionless insertion of the oxygen atom into original oxygen vacant site of the pyrochlore-type structure. Another was an orthorhombic alpha-PbO2 related-type possessing a cation ordered arrangement unlike a well known NiWO4 Structure. The other was the rutile related-type possessing a cation ordered arrangement. Appearance of the two latter metastable phases could be attributed to the displacement of the oxygen stacking in the K-CeZrO4 related-type phase without cation redistributions. The appearance mechanisms were analogous to the well known transformations for AX(2) compounds among rutile-type, alpha-PbO2-type, and fluorite-type phases under high pressure and its release. The dependence of the appearance of these novel metastable phases on oxygen partial pressure and temperature has been discussed in terms of the driving forces and energy barriers for reactions.
